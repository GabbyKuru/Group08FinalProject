"I am sitting at my computer listening to my roommate singing in the background. I can't really smell anything because I'm getting over a cold. I'm thinking about last night. My sorority had a party at Antone's and my date just didn't show up. I've been considering for the last few hours what kind of excuse he is going to come up with this morning. Either way he owes me big time. Now I'm listening to the Doors, again accompanied by my roommate singing and me a little with her. I trying to think of what to write about in this stream of consciousness. I have a class today that I have to read for before 2 o'clock. I really don't feel like reading for that class, but I guess I have to. It's biology and I like the class, but I just caught up with the reading yesterday and then now we have to read a another whole chapter which I am not to excited about. My foot is starting to hurt because I was sitting on it weird, adn now it's asleep. I hate the feeling you get when your foot is trying to wake back up I guess you would call it. This CD that I'm listening to has quite a mix on it. now we're listening to the beatles. It's not my CD or I would know what is on it. I wonder if they will ever completely stop illegal downloading of music on the internet. I mean there's no really way that you can stop anything on the internet. It's too vast and someone will allays think of a way to get around things. I have a download capability on my computer but I don't use it all that often, so I doubt the people like me are the ones they are really after. I understand that some musicians are angry because it takes away from their profits, but downloading allows the person to listen to their music, decide if they like it or not, and then decide to buy the cd. Many of the songs that you download on the internet are not the best quality, so it is easier to just go out and buy the CD. I have no idea who this song playing is by. I still have exes on my hands from the bar last night, I really need to try and wash them off before I forget about it and go to class with them still on. I don't like the way they write exes on your hands. Is not one hand enough? They really don't need to mark both of them. I don't even think you could wash them off in the bathroom of the bar if you wanted to. There would be too much of a chance that they would catch you and throw you out, which would be really embarrassing. Last night was okay, it was not nearly as much fun as I was expecting it to be. Well maybe if my date had showed up, it would've been more fun. I'm not too worried about it though, my boyfriend comes into town tonight so I'm more excited about that. He is not coming in until much later though, I wish he could come earlier. I also need to make sure my friend is going to come up for Lion Hunt, another thing that the sorority throws. Life is so hectic at college, I don't ahve time to really do anything. I don't know how some people do it. They can just go to class, not do any of the reading and be okay with that. If I'm behind in a class it bothers me until I get it done. Then after I sit down and do the reading or the homework, everything's so much better. All I did yesterday afternoon was read. I'm caught up in psychology and journalism finally. But then next week, the cycle starts all over again. I guess that's why I feel like I'm never caught up completely. We're listening to School's Out for Summer"", I wish it was! But that won't happen for a very very long time. But I had fun this summer. I didn't have a job, so I got to do whatever I wanted. It was fun. I really need to straighten up my room, it's got clothes everywhere. They're all clean but thrown around from when I was trying to figure out what to wear last night. I need to go to the grocery store too, I'm out of bottled water and drinks. I need to get more hangers too. Ok enough of this random writing, my 20 minutes are up.",0
"Analytical psychology (, sometimes translated as analytic philosophy) is a branch of psychology that takes a cognitive-behavioral approach to understanding human behavior. It is a relatively recent development in psychology, dating back only to the early 20th century.  Analytical psychology is characterized by its focus on understanding the individual mind and behavior, as opposed to the traditional focus on group behavior and whole person analysis. It has been described as ""theoretical psychology with a microscope"" because its practitioners are often interested in studying the smallest details of mental processes.  Analytical psychologists often use mathematical modeling and computer simulation to explore how individual thoughts and behaviors can produce outcomes. They are also known for their focus on self-awareness and the ability of the mind to process information.",1

" Living on a budget means carefully managing your income and expenses to ensure that you are living within your means and not accumulating additional debt. If you have a great many debts, creating and sticking to a budget can be a crucial step towards improving your financial situation.  To begin with, you will need to take a close look at your income and expenses. Make a list of all your debts, including the amount owed, interest rates, and minimum payments required. Next, track all of your income sources and expenses over a period of at least one month. This will give you a better understanding of where your money is going and where you may be able to cut back.  Once you have a clear picture of your financial situation, it's time to create a budget. Start by prioritizing your debts and making sure to make at least the minimum payments on each one. Consider creating a debt repayment plan that prioritizes the highest interest debts first, as these will cost you the most in the long run.  Next, identify areas where you can reduce your expenses. This could include cutting back on dining out or entertainment, canceling subscription services, or finding ways to save on groceries and utilities. Look for ways to increase your income as well, such as taking on additional work or selling items you no longer need.  It's important to stick to your budget and make adjustments as needed. Avoid taking on new debt unless absolutely necessary, and make a habit of saving a portion of your income each month. Over time, as you pay down your debts and improve your financial situation, you can gradually adjust your budget and increase your savings. Remember, living on a budget is about making responsible choices and being mindful of your spending habits, and it can be a powerful tool for achieving financial stability and long-term success.

The two had worked together in the past, notably during the Russian Revolution of 1905. However, Halfrek's raison d'etre differed from Anya's.

"Krakatau split with a blinding noise and raised from gutted, steaming rock a pulverized black sky, over water walls that swiftly fell on Java and Sumatra. Fifteen days before, in its cage in Amsterdam, the last known member of Equus quagga, the southernmost subspecies of zebra, died. Most of the wild ones, not wild enough, grazing near the Cape of Good Hope, had been shot and skinned and roasted by white hunters. When a spider walked on cooling Krakatau's skin, no quagga walked anywhere. While seeds pitched by long winds onto newborn fields burst open and rooted, perhaps some thistle flourished on the quagga's discarded innards. The fractured island greened and hummed again; handsome zebras tossed their heads in zoos, on hired safari plains. Who needs to hear a quagga's voice? Or see the warm hide twitch away a fly, see the neck turn, curving its cream and chestnut stripes that run down to plain dark haunches and plain white legs? A kind of horse. Less picturesque than a dodo. Still, we mourn what we mourn. Even if, when it sank to its irreplaceable knees, when its unique throat closed behind a sigh, no dust rose to redden a whole year's sunsets, no one unwittingly busy two thousand miles away jumped at the sound, no ashes rained on ships in the merciless sea.",0

"Life is a journey through endless time,
A canvas painted with feelings sublime,
A tapestry woven with threads of fate,
An intricate dance with joy and heartache.

We traverse this path with each passing day,
Taking in all that comes our way,
The highs and the lows that make us grow,
With every step we learn and we know.

Life gives us moments of purest bliss,
When love and laughter are hard to miss,
But it also deals us its heavy blow,
With pain and sorrow we must learn to grow.

We face challenges that test our might,
And push us to stand up and fight,
To find our strength and courage within,
And know that we'll come out to win.

The beauty of life lies in its sway,
With each breath a new beginning, a new day,
In every moment, a chance to start anew,
And embrace the wonders that life offers you. 

So live your life with passion and zeal,
Chase your dreams and let your heart feel,
For every experience, good or bad,
Adds a color to the canvas of life we've had.",1

"I miss my guitar. I wish that I had brought one of them with me. I have to be sure to bring my amp and at least one guitar, maybe two of them back from home this weekend. That kind of sucks though, that I let mom borrow the one I really want to bring with me. I am glad though that she taking lessons. Maybe I could teach her some Metallica. I hope she helps Erin pay for that car she wants. But Erin also wants to get it repainted, because she just doesn't like the color. Oh well, I'm glad Erin is getting that car, BMW's are real safe. I should know, I've totaled enough of them. That scares me though, because kids have wrecks, and I've already lost a cousin, I don't know what I would do if I lost my sister. At least they're safe cars. I hope I can get a car for Christmas. I know I totaled a bunch of cars, but I was also an addict when I was in all of those wrecks, and I'm better now, it could be a reward. My doctor is really proud of me. When I told him that I had been clean for 101 days, he was very proud and said that ""a lot of times adults can't even do that, so you must be an adult. "" I was happy about that.

"Wow this is actually a cool writing assignment. I would have never expected to be asked to sit here at my computer and just write what I am thinking for a 20 minute period. I have just gotten back from a meeting about the Texas Lonestars organization and LOVED it!  The only problem is that I am just a freshman still getting use to the whole college life and time management thing. I am kind of stressed out (but not nearly as bad as I know I can get sometimes) just because I am pre med and I know that I really need to concentrate on my grades and school work while also getting involved. Getting involved, however has never been a problem for me. I love to be involved in everything. Now that is a problem because if I spread myself too thin I am not going to be able to put forth my best in each venue. I know for sure that I want to do something involving dance because it has been such an intricate part of my life for so long and is truly one of my passions. I am going to try out for the Roustabouts and the Steel Dance Company. I am beginning to get nervous just because I haven't really gotten the chance to practice anywhere here since I've been away from home. I hope that I am able to keep my grades really good while also having fun and enjoying my college experience. I know that I am here to get an education, but it's obvious to everyone that college doesn't just teach you knowlege in your courses that are suppose to be preparation for your career, but it's also a learning experience for life lessons. I feel that just in the week and a half that I have been here I have already become more responsible and determined.      It has been kind of hard switching from not only my hometown to a new, huge city, but also from summer and relaxation and the feeling of ""yey school is over"" to ""wow, my life is just beginning, along with lots of studying that I don't really want to do. ""  My life has just been kind of awkward lately anyway. I know that things are suppose to change when you go off to college in so many ways especially through your habits and relationships and mine definitely has. The fact that my family has been going through changes of its own has made me feel somewhat distant and like I don't belong. Yet, the funny thing is that I don't really care or maybe it's that I don't know how to make the effort to fit in again. My first time to go home will be to a different home than the one that I've lived in for the past four years (even though I lived there when I was younger) and I feel like it will just be weird to see how my family's lives have just king of carried on without me. I won't really understand my mom's relationship with the guy she is dating or how my brother is experiencing or enjoying high school. My dad is perhaps the only one that I will probably still feel just about the same with because I am use to not seeing him all the time. My time is almost up and as of right now I am just really hoping that, even though I may not be showing my priority to God right now, he will really just step into my life and help me control it in the right direction.",0
" In my opinion, study hall is not a waste of time and can be a necessary break from regular classes. Here are some reasons and examples to support this position:  Time for completing homework: Study hall allows students to use their time wisely and complete homework, assignments, or projects they may not have had time to finish at home. It can also help students who struggle with time management to better organize their workload.  Opportunity for focused study: Study hall can provide a quiet and focused environment for students to study for upcoming exams or quizzes without distractions from home or other classes.  Opportunity for extra help: During study hall, students can ask their teachers for extra help or clarification on topics they may not have understood in class. This can help improve their understanding and boost their grades.  Break from regular classes: Study hall can provide a necessary break from regular classes, which can be mentally exhausting. It can also give students a chance to decompress and reduce stress levels.  Time for extracurricular activities: If students do not have any unfinished work, study hall can also give them time to participate in extracurricular activities such as clubs, sports, or music. This can provide a much-needed break from academic work and promote a healthy balance of activities.  In conclusion, study hall is not a waste of time but a necessary break from regular classes. It provides students with opportunities to complete unfinished work, study, seek extra help, and participate in extracurricular activities.                 ",1
"Tolerable daily intake (TDI) refers to the daily amount of a chemical that has been assessed safe for human being on long-term basis (usually whole lifetime). Originally acceptable daily intake (ADI) was introduced in 1961 to define the daily intake of a food additive which, during the entire lifetime, appears to be without appreciable risk. For contaminants and other foreign chemicals not used intentionally, the term TDI is often preferred. Both ADI and TDI are usually assessed based on animal experiments, and it is most often hundreds of times lower than the dose causing no observable adverse effect (NOAEL) in the most sensitive tested animal species. Because the uncertainty factors (safety factors) may vary depending on the quality of data and the type of adverse effect, TDI values are not good estimates of the harmfulness of chemicals, and must be considered administrative tools to set allowable limits for chemicals, rather than scientific measures. The threshold limit value (TLV) of a chemical substance is a level to which it is believed a worker can be exposed day after day for a working lifetime without adverse effects. References",0
"Fire, oh fire, so wild and bright
Dancing flames that light up the night
A force of nature, untamed and free
A captivating sight for all to see

From the smallest ember to the raging blaze
You consume all in your fiery ways
You devour everything in your path
Leaving naught but destruction and ash

Yet, in your midst, there is a beauty
A warmth and a glow that none can deny
A symbol of passion, love and desire
A muse for poets and artists to admire

You bring light to the darkness of the night
A beacon for lost souls to find their way right
You warm up our cold and shivering bones
A friend to the lonely and broken-hearted ones

Fire, oh fire, you are a curious thing
A double-edged sword, a blessing and a curse it seems
But your power and might remains unmatched
A true embodiment of life's fierce and unpredictable patch",1

" Brushing your teeth is an essential part of your daily oral hygiene routine. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to brush your teeth properly:  Choose the right toothbrush: Select a toothbrush with soft bristles and a small head that fits comfortably in your mouth.

Brush your teeth: Use gentle circular motions to brush the fronts, backs, and tops of your teeth. Be sure to brush all surfaces of your teeth, including the outer, inner, and chewing surfaces. Brush your tongue gently to remove bacteria and freshen your breath.  Spit and rinse: Spit out the toothpaste and rinse your mouth thoroughly with water.  Clean your toothbrush: Rinse your toothbrush under running water and store it in an upright position to air dry.  Repeat twice a day: Brush your teeth at least twice a day for two minutes each time, ideally after breakfast and before bed.

"Oh shape, why do you intrigue me so?
A form so unique, with sides in tow.
From circles to squares, and everything in between,
There's not a shape that I haven't seen.

But one in particular stands out to me,
Its curves and proportions so perfectly.
It's got a name, the ellipse they say,
A shape that I can admire all day.

With two foci and a symmetrical curve,
The ellipse's beauty is hard to swerve.
It's found in nature, and man-made too,
From the orbits of planets to a pond's view.

The ellipse, you see, is not just a shape,
It's a symbol of balance and without an escape.
It's the shape that represents the universe's motion,
A shape so perfect it commands devotion.

So here's to the ellipse, my shape of delight,
A form so intriguing, it's always a sight.

And marvel at its beauty for all eternity.",1

"Change is an elusive wave
It haunts, it inspires, it saves
It carries us through a sea of time
And leads us to worlds, both sublime and divine

Change is the wind that shifts our sails
It whispers, it pulls, it propels
It takes us from familiar shores
And opens up new horizons and doors

Change is the flame that ignites our souls
It burns, it transforms, it controls
It reveals our strengths and weaknesses alike
And sets us on a path towards our true self-like

Change is the seed that grows within
It sprouts, it blooms, it wins
It transforms our thoughts and feelings deep
And grants us a new outlook to keep

Change is the rhythm of life’s dance
It moves, it flows, it takes a chance
It creates a symphony of destiny
And shows us the world’s true complexity

For change is the essence of all things
It challenges, it shapes, it sings
It is the magic that makes life worth
And enables us to evolve on this earth.",1

"Oscar Moore (23 March 1960 – 12 September 1996) was a British journalist and the author of one novel, A Matter of Life and Sex, published in 1991 originally under the pseudonym Alec F. Moran (an anagram for roman à clef). He grew up in London and was educated at the independent The Haberdashers' Aske's Boys' School, going on to read English at Pembroke College, Cambridge, graduating in 1982. He worked as a journalist and critic, under his own name and various pseudonyms, to such magazines as Time Out, I-D, The Times, Punch, The Evening Standard, and The Fred Magazine (in which his novel was first serialised). He was editor of The Business of Film magazine during the mid-1980s, and served as editor of the journal Screen International from 1991 until his death. A Matter of Life and Sex is an autobiographical novel recounting the coming of age of a gay man, Hugo Harvey, who engages in sex from a young age and later, during college, works at least part-time as a prostitute, contracting HIV/AIDS in the mid-1980s before the advent of effective anti-HIV drugs. The novel describes the protagonist's relationships with his family (most significantly with his mother), his school friends, his casual sex mates, and with other friends battling HIV/AIDS. Moore himself has been described as ""handsome, bright, witty, and gay,"" and worked occasionally as a male escort in addition to his magazine work. He lived with HIV for the last 13 years of his life, and from 1994 to 1996 wrote a regular column for The Guardian entitled ""PWA (Person With AIDS).""  Moore lost his sight owing to his HIV infection and died of AIDS-related illness in 1996 at the age of 36. A book collecting his ""PWA"" columns was published a month after his death. A stage adaptation was produced in London in 2001.",0
"Let's Bowl is a scripted bowling game show that aired on the Comedy Central television network from 2001 to 2002 after a brief run on several TV stations across the U.S. in the mid-1990s, the first three being Minneapolis-St. Paul stations: KXLI-TV 41 (Now KPXM-TV), KLGT-TV 23 (now WUCW), and KARE channel 11. Overview Hosts Steve ""Chopper"" Sedahl (himself) and Wally Hotvedt (Rich Kronfeld) wore outfits and headsets reminiscent of sportscasters of the 1970s and early 1980s, and did play-by-play as contestants bowled against each other. Described as a cross between The People's Court and Bowling for Dollars, the show had participants play against each other to settle feuds and win nearly worthless prizes. For example, in the second 1998 episode, a player received merchandise for a radio station that had been defunct for two years. Gift certificates for Old Country Buffet were common that year. Another episode gave a foodservice-sized can of tuna to the runner up, while the winner received a 2 gallon consumer-strength jug of Roundup.",0

"In combat sports such as boxing, an orthodox stance is a standing position with the feet slightly wider than shoulder-width, the weight shifted towards the ball of the foot, and the hands held close to the body.  The orthodox stance is considered to be one of the most effective stances in boxing. It allows a boxer to cover more ground with their footwork, and also keep their opponent at a distance by preventing them from landing clean punches.",1
" The current U.S. tax system is progressive, which means that individuals with higher incomes pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes than those with lower incomes. The argument for a flat tax system is that it would simplify the tax code and create a fairer system in which everyone pays the same percentage of their income in taxes.  Proponents of the flat tax argue that it would eliminate the need for complicated tax forms and reduce the compliance costs associated with the current system. They also argue that it would be fairer because everyone would be contributing the same percentage of their income, regardless of their income level.  However, opponents of the flat tax argue that it would disproportionately benefit the wealthy and hurt low-income individuals. Under a flat tax system, individuals with high incomes would pay a lower percentage of their income in taxes than they currently do, while low-income individuals would pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes. This could exacerbate income inequality and make it harder for low-income individuals to make ends meet.  Furthermore, the current progressive tax system is designed to provide a safety net for those who are struggling financially. For example, low-income individuals are often eligible for tax credits and other benefits that can help them make ends meet. A flat tax system would eliminate these benefits, making it harder for low-income individuals to get by.  In conclusion, the choice between a progressive and flat tax system ultimately comes down to values and priorities. While a flat tax system may simplify the tax code, it may also exacerbate income inequality and hurt low-income individuals. The current progressive tax system, while more complicated, is designed to provide a safety net for those who are struggling financially.      ",1
"Oh, the colors of the flowers
Are a sight to behold
They sparkle and shine in the sun
And radiate beauty to behold

There's crimson-red roses so fair
And daffodils so bright and yellow
Lilacs that bloom in the cool spring air
And pansies that look so mellow

The tulips in pink, yellow, and red
Are like a rainbow in the ground
And forget-me-nots, blue and true
Are like a little piece of heaven found

So let us celebrate each petal
Each color that blooms so bright
For they add beauty to our world
And fill our hearts with delight.",1

"Well, here goes. I'm listening to all of the songs i've fuond over the last few days and am slowly getting tired of them. I'm worried about my typing skills too. I've gotten worse and i can't figure out why. Maybe it's the keyboard, or maybe it's the desk. I doubt it's becuase i'm always in a hurry. Why would that be it? I really like this next song though. I hope my roommate is able to get to the movie tonight because i don't want her to miss it. I'm glad that i found someone to go with though. That would be horrible if i hadn't! I'm getting really frustrated that i can't seem to get this Welcome Package! Really, who locks their doors when they know everyone has to get in!! Maybe i'm just really weak and can't get in. No no. . that's not it. They locked their doors. I'm going to have to ask Sarah to go with me. I also need to call Amy. Grr. i don't want to do that , but it would be rude not to call her. What else? I need to go to the gym, but that's another thing i don't want to do alone and sarah's to lazy to go. I'm really excited that there are going to be 5 fred movies in a row this month! What luck! And a   road   movie!! It just proves that soemtimes dreams really do come true. hahha. well, maybe. I just hope i'm able to go home to see it because it comes on really early in the morning and i don't think my roommate would like me to much if i woke her up to watch a movie. Of course, she is a heavy sleeper, so she might not even notice. Man, my arms are getting tired. i don't why that is. i guess i should relax and just sing along.  i'm singing in the rain!   hmmm. . that's not working to well. I really wish i could go home more often because i do not like what the water is doing to my hair. It looks horrible, but i shouldn't care because i've never cared before. Of course, my hair has never looked to so bad before. I'm really tired too. I want to read something interesting for once. I wish I had my Entertainment Weekly already, but nooo, i have to wait till Sept. 27. That's a long time! I don't know if I can wait that long. I need something! I'm dying over here without a book! I have cable now, but that's no substitute. I am glad that the cable has TCM and Cartoon Network. It's weird how my taste changed this summer. I never thought I would be into the PowerPuff Girls, but I am. i really always thought they're name was PowDerPuff Girls. Oops. It's a cute show though. I can't decide who i like the most. It's just one of those shows where the jokes are really subtle, so it makes me feel smart when I get them. Not to many shows can do that nowadays. It's like the movies. Not to many movies make you think anymore. I really wanted to ask Stacy today if she had ever seen Charade because that is a good movie. It makes you think because who would have suspected the guy it was? Of course, once you watch it the second time it's not as good, but that first viewing is great! There are other movies too. The Game was a good one! The one with Micheal Douglas right? That's what the movie is called i believe. I was so shocked. . in fact it's been so long since I've seen it taht i really don't remember what all happened, i just know it made you think. I wish people would come out with more of those movies. Why don't they? Did they decline in popularity? The same question goes for musicals? Why don't they make dancing movies anymore? Of course I've seen some of the more recent dancing movies and they didn't do well at the box office. Maybe the plot could have been better. Plus, today everything has to do with sex appeal. If a movie doesn't have that at least in one spot it's a flop. Ginger and Fred never had to have that. I think the idea of sexual tension helped them out enough. Of course, people used to go see movies just for the actors. People today go for the actors and actresses but they also go for what happens. Why did people go see Fast and the Furious? Because they knew Vin Diesel would show off his body and everything. The movie itself was crap. the plot was zilch. Whatever happened to good comedians too? I'm listening to Jack Benny now and although I don't always understand the jokes, I can tell he was a man many people loved and admired because he's so clean. It doesn't take much to make people laugh, but today the jokes can be so dirty that it's not always funny. I admit i laugh sometimes, but you can't help but feel bad. I hope the movie tonight is worthwhile. Everyone says it's great, obviously because it's a box-office hit. I think it's so great that there's a place where one can view movies for free. Who knew that college would be so nice? I miss my family a lot but i like being able to go out and do other things without having to ask first. I do feel like i have to ask but something stops me everytime. Mom doesn't have to know everything. haha. I hope everyone comes up here soon. Ok, the sound effects man on this episode is rather annoying. After listening to a radio show once you don't want to listen to it to often. The same goes with songs, but i can deal with that. I need to find a Tv guide so i know when Seinfeld and Raymond comes on. It bothers me that i'm missing those. I don't like the guide on the TV, it's hard to follow. Plus, it would be nice to have the guide like at home.",0
"A mountain top so high and steep,
A place where few will ever keep,
Their feet planted on solid ground,
With views that leave us all spellbound.

The journey up is long and tough,
A test of strength, a climb so rough,
But those who make it to the peak,
Are filled with pride, their hearts do speak.

For all the struggles that they faced,
The doubts and fears they had to chase,
Were worth it for the sweet reward,
The sense of achievement, they’ve scored.

And though the path was never clear,
And obstacles would oft appear,
These mountaineers would persevere,
Until their goal was finally near.

So here’s to those who climb so high,
Who strive for greatness to defy,
The odds that say they can’t complete,
An achievement that’s truly sweet.",1
"Right now I am feeling much rage and it stems from the outcome of this weekend. I had traveled for three hours to visit my family and friends hoping that I would be welcomed with opened arms. Half of my theory was right. My family welcomed me with much warmth but my friends pretty much took a dump on my face. Well not all of them. A few in particular. My whole weekend was, in my mind a total waste of time. My so called best friends would rather spend time with their ridiculously uptight and stuck up girlfriends than to hang out with a best friend. I had known them my entire life and these girls just walked into the picture less than a couple of months ago. Nothing but anger subdued my mind for the following three days. I refused to let myself be depressed so I figured I would go shoot some pool. But to my dismay, one of my friends showed up, this one was one of my female counterparts, and she pranced in with a guy standing next to her. So what. That part didn't piss me off as much as the fact that they were at a party and didn't bother to pick up the phone. Not even to say hi. She did not even return my calls or answer my pages. To make it even worse, she pretended she did nothing wrong and pursued to make friendly conversation. To hell with that. I walked out of there without even saying good bye or giving a reason why. My mind was filled with so much raw emotion, the negative kind that can tear a hole through your soul. That's when I realized that Houston was no longer my home. I no longer had any true friends in the city that I grew up in for 18 years. Like I said, my friends had pretty much crapped in my mouth. I'm not sure if they were aware or not but that is completly beside the point. I am home now. The city of Austin where I would rather meet and make new friends than to salvage the friendships that I already had. I believe it is a wise choice otherwise I will just continue to be put in such an unstable emotional state. Not once this whole weekend I had a good thought in my mind. I was fine until my so called friends sold me out to be with a girl all night so that they could get freaky with each other. I've got no problem with my friends being horny and wanting to get it on with their girlfriends but at least hang out with me for one damn night out of three. Now I can relax and look forward to this weekend where I will undoubtedly have a good time while my friends stay at home with their thumbs up each other's asses. Screw all of them. I don't need them anymore than I need the toilet paper I wipe my ass with. Austin is a hell of a lot more exciting than houston and my asshole friends can stay there because they were too damn stupid to get into UT in the first place. I hope they are having fun at community college, or high school for those that were too dumb to even graduate high school. Good luck flipping those burgers at McDonald's the rest of your lives.",0
"I'm thinking I don't know what to write This popsicle tastes good, I'm really bored, my roommate is gone I'm sitting here in a stupor, not really thinking about anything I'm thinking I miss my girlfriend and I should probably    call her when I am done with this the popsicle tastes good. I hear the  bass from the stereo of person in the room next to me and I think it's  kind of annoying. Tonight is going to be fun, I am looking forward to that, this popsicle is really good. I think I need to clean my room, it's really messy. I need to throw out the food wrappers, put my clothes away, that persons stereo is really annoying, I hear loud voices in the hall, I wonder who they are, it sounds like a cute girl, I need to put my papers and  homework away. I am going to get another popsicle. It tastes good too. I wonder if a m doing this assignment correctly. I am looking around my room for things to think about, but nothing really sparks any interest. I'm really bored. I think I will turn the radio on. Never mind, I think that that might interfere with my stream of consciousness. I hear one of my friends voices outside talking about the start of intramural football with somebody. I can't wait for that to start, but I am upset that I have to play coed instead of men's. This other popsicle is really good too. I feel papers in my pocket and I take them out, its my bank statements. That makes me upset because I see all the things I wasted my money on. I throw them on the floor. I'm thinking  that my time is a little over halfway done, and that makes me feel good because I am looking forward to stop typing this. When I am done I think I will take a shower, and then maybe, I'm thinking about something interesting I can do after that, I'm playing racquetball at 5 so something in between that. I don't know, maybe I can figure something out when my roommate comes back. I'm hungry. Now I'm eating chips. I'm laughing because I'm thinking if you actually read this one you will think I have an obsession with food, which I kind of do but that's just because I am hungry all the time. I really like the chips. I'm kind of sleepy too,  maybe I'll take a nap. I was thinking about typing and how I am good at it and that made me think about my grandpa for some reason because he looks really silly when he types and that made me miss him because I haven't seen him in over a year. Maybe I will call him this weekend   I love chips and salsa, it's damn good. My roommate is going to be pissed because I am eating them all without him. It doesn't matter though because I am really hungry. 2 minutes left I can't wait till this is over, its been interesting but I want to do other stuff. I'm excited though because this counts as a grade and this will be a good start for psychology class. I really like these chips. Well times up and now I'm really happy because I'm done.",0

"Burning Bush  is a 2013 three-part miniseries created for HBO by Polish director Agnieszka Holland. Based on real characters and events, this haunting drama focuses on the personal sacrifice of a Prague history student, Jan Palach, who set himself on fire in 1969 in protest against the Soviet occupation of Czechoslovakia in the previous year. Dagmar Burešová, a young female lawyer, became part of his legacy by defending Palach's family in a trial against the communist government, a regime which tried to dishonour Palach’s sacrifice, a heroic action for the freedom of Czechoslovakia. The fight for freedom, for moral principles, self-sacrifice and protest in those desperate times led to the moral unification of a repressed nation, which twenty years later defeated the totalitarian regime. The anniversary of Jan Palach’s death inspired a new generation of students to start protests that led to the eventual fall of communism in Czechoslovakia, part of the eventual destruction of the Iron Curtain.",0
"Right now I am sitting in my dorm room thinking about how much reading I have to finish tonight. I am listening to the radio as I write this. Jessica Simpson is what I am listening to. I am also thinking about how many typing errors I make as I type. I am drinking Pink Lemonade and chewing Orbit gum. I am also thinking about my boyfriend, and waiting for either an email or a phone call from Kuwait. I am very worried about him, but he reassures me everyday that he will be ok. I have to read a lot of Biology tonight. I also have to get my clothes together for tomorrow morning. Tomorrow is the start of my first full week as a college student. I don't like college to much, it is quite boring and time consuming. I would prefer to be going to college closer to home or at home, but here is where I find myself. Oh well, it's okay. I'm testing the waters and seeing how I like this place. So far so good, the football games are fun and my classes are interesting. Except for one of my Biology classes, my professor is evil. I wish that my boyfriend would call, I would really like to talk to him. I miss him so much, and I can't wait till he comes home. I have lots of pictures of my family and boyfriend in my room. They are all over, I miss them all so much. I hate being this far from them, but I have to do what I have to do. I am full from eating a giant burrito at Freebirds about an hour ago. I keep staring at my cell phone hoping someone will call me. I still have to do some Pre Calculus homework and read for Psychology too. I received one Instant Message, I wonder who it was from. Probably my little cousin who bothers me all the time. Everytime someone signs on and off the internet that annoying door sound plays. It gets on my nerves. I wish it was Saturday still, I had fun on Saturday. I am tired of typing and I want to start my reading so I can go to bed. My roommate is going to Jack n the Box, and she asked if I wanted anything, but I do not like burgers or greasy food anymore. Plus I am watching my figure and do not want to get the dreaded Freshman 15!"" I just got an email but I can't read it until this is over I want to read it so bad because it might be from my boyfriend. Dang I so wish that I could check my email, with my luck it probably was my boyfriend. My music stopped and no it is silent in my room but I can hear some music from my RA's room. I think her roommate is playing the music. It sounds funny from here but oh well. I'm really tired from staying up so late of Friday night, but I guess that's what I get. This gum is already starting to lose flavor and I just barely put it in my mouth. Yuck! Blah! I got new sunglasses this weekend. I like them a lot. I got to shop some this weekend, and I bought more food for my room. I didn't need any of it, but it was definitely a spur of the moment type thing. I really need to read my Biology so I can read my Psychology so that I can take a shower and go to bed. It's only been 13 minutes since I began typing and I feel like I have been typing forever. I am worried about my Biology class and I hope I do good. I don't want to let anyone back home down. I want to be able to prove my ex friend wrong that I can be on my own, since she was to chicken to leave home. But I don't like her anyways, she has an obsession with thinking my world revolves around her, when obviously hers revolves around me. I don't know if that made sense, but I don't really care. Only five more minutes left and I am running out of things to write about. I got another email and now I am pretty sure it is my boyfriend. This is the longest 5 minutes of my life. I also have never made this many mistakes when I type. Oh well. I want to run downstairs and get myself some snacks. I wish I could go get some right now but I have to finish writing. I realize that I can't wait to get something over with and then when I start it I don't really feel like finishing it. Oh well, only a little bit more time left. Then I can cross this off my to-do list for the week. I miss my boyfriend so much, I cannot wait till he comes home. I get to go home next month! YAY! I can't wait to see my family and my puppy! I am thinking about all the times I had when I was at home. I had a sense of security there, I am very family oriented and I miss them a lot. Only 30 seconds left. And then I have more to do tonight. I have so much to do in so little time. Time to get it all done so I'm not swamped this week.",0

"I approached the luminous stranger who came to me
from darkness in a gown of lettuce leaves, in a velvet
cloak of green that appeared at first another piece of dark,
but pulled apart into the glow-sphere that danced
in swaying steps, the lucent majesty that slipped toward me
from the reigning silence black above my cage.
Oh extravagant—and were my teeth too sharp to greet
or sharp enough? I do not understand now what was meant
to happen and what was a mistake—but know the bursting,
the sickening snap of ecstasy wrenched back to the body
and the green gown flung in crippled circles traced
like diagrams of wasting moons above my head—or portals
to another world, I thought, but as I thought, the shriek
dissolved, the body crumpled from the air and landed
on its side beneath the salt lick. All night I tended
the wasted skin and careful, brought it water,
alfalfa, made a bed of cedar chips and tried to gather
molecules of breath that floated from the plant shelf.
When I remembered morning, I began to cry, began to pray
for night to stay until the green took shape again
and if that shape were gone, I prayed for night
to stay, to be held in the same forever-dark
in which I first looked up and saw the gentle body,
and saw the graceful swaying of the stranger coming   as if for me—now I do not know—but then,
as if for me, and all my loneliness gone.",0
" There are several reasons why some people may be afraid of sharks. Here are a few:  Media portrayal: Sharks are often depicted in movies and the media as vicious and ruthless predators. These images can create fear and anxiety in people, especially those who have little direct experience with sharks.  Lack of familiarity: Many people have never been in the ocean or have never seen a shark up close. This lack of familiarity with the animal can make it seem mysterious and dangerous.  Personal experiences: Some people may have had negative experiences with sharks, such as being bitten or attacked. Even if these incidents are rare, they can create a lasting fear of the animal.  Evolutionary response: It's possible that our fear of sharks is partly a result of evolution. Our ancestors may have learned to fear large, predatory animals as a survival mechanism, and this fear has been passed down through generations.  Overall, while some fear of sharks may be rational, it's important to remember that they are not usually a threat to humans and that the vast majority of shark encounters end without incident.

"The light that beams from heaven's grace
Gives way to shadows we must face
It guides us through life's treacherous terrain
And fills our hearts with warmth and gain

The sun that rises every dawn
Paints a picture of a world reborn
Its rays of beauty shine so bright
And spread the warmth of love and light

The stars that twinkle in the night
Bring calmness to our mind's fresh sight
Their shining light brings peace and ease
As we gaze into the starry seas

The torch that lights the path ahead
Leads us to where our souls are fed
It ignites a flame within our hearts
And keeps us moving forward from the start

The light that shines within us all
Is the hope that never shall fall
It carries us through the darkest night
And lights the world with its purest might.",1

"  Reality shows have gained popularity in recent years, and there are now more shows in this genre than ever before. However, whether or not these shows make good television depends on several factors.  On the one hand, reality shows can be entertaining and engaging for viewers, as they offer a glimpse into the lives of ordinary people and their personal struggles and triumphs. These shows can also be educational, as they can help viewers learn about different cultures and lifestyles.  For example, the show ""Queer Eye"" on Netflix offers a positive and uplifting experience by featuring experts who provide makeovers to people who need a boost in their lives. This show helps viewers learn about different lifestyles and the challenges that people face while also promoting self-improvement and acceptance.  On the other hand, some reality shows can be overly dramatized and manipulative, which can detract from their entertainment value. These shows may rely on creating conflict and drama between the participants to increase viewership, rather than focusing on genuine human experiences.  For example, shows like ""Jersey Shore"" and ""Keeping Up With the Kardashians"" have been criticized for promoting negative and superficial values, and for contributing to the decline of culture and intellectual standards on television.  In conclusion, reality shows can make good television if they are well-produced and offer genuine insights into the human experience. However, if they rely on overly dramatized situations and promote negative values, they may not be good for society as a whole.    ",1
" Preserving family history is an important endeavor, and interviewing an older relative is a great way to learn about your family's past.

"The forest whispers secrets untold
Of ancient trees and creatures bold
In its embrace, I find my soul
Amid the rustle and the roll

Tall and proud, the trees stand tall 
Their roots deep, their leaves a shawl
From a distance, they form a haze
A sanctuary, a mystic maze

The air is pure, the breeze a song
In the forest, I truly belong
The canopy a shield from the sun
A haven for all, where life begun

Amidst the green, I find peace unseen
The world outside, a mere dream
With every step, a new adventure 
A world of wonder, at my pleasure

The forest calls out to me again
A land of magic, wild and plain
I wander in its gentle fold
Finding my soul, in the secrets it holds.",1

"Hazard's Pavilion was a large auditorium in Los Angeles, California, at the intersection of Fifth and Olive Streets.  Showman George ""Roundhouse"" Lehman had planned to  construct a large theatre center on the land he purchased at this location, but he went broke and the property was sold to the City Attorney (and soon to be Mayor), Henry T. Hazard.  The venue was built in 1887 by architects Kysor, Morgan & Walls at a cost of $25,000, a large amount for the time, and seated up to 4,000 people (some sources say that seating could be up to 8,000; the building was divided into two galleries, and perhaps each accommodated 4,000). The building was constructed of wood with a clapboard exterior, and the front was framed by two towers. Hazard's Pavilion As the largest building of its type in Los Angeles at the time, Hazard's Pavilion was a venue for conventions, political meetings, lectures, fairs, religious meetings, concerts, operas, balls, and sports events. It opened in April, 1887 with a modest civic flower festival, but a month later it hosted the National Opera Company with 300 singers, ballet dancers, and musicians. The Pavilion hosted regular religious meetings, including a series in 1888 where famed evangelist Dwight L. Moody spoke. In attendance at one of these meetings was Harry A. Ironside, which led him to becoming a world-famous preacher in his own right. Booker T. Washington, William Jennings Bryan and Carrie Nation were among the famous people who spoke to crowds gathered at Hazard's Pavilion.

", also known as Attorney General v. Khan, is a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court ruled 5-4 that the federal government cannot compel a person to provide genetic information to a government agency.  The case arises from an appeal by Agha Khan, the son of the spiritual leader of the Ismaili Muslims, against a decision by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to require him to provide a genealogical sample to verify his familial relationship to other individuals who applied for federal health benefits. Khan argued that compliance with the request would violate his right to privacy under the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution.  The case was heard by the Supreme Court in 2016.

"Oh, how I long for that one moment in time
When the world seemed to stand still
And everything fell into perfect rhyme
A memory that haunts me still

It was a day of golden sunbeams and laughter
Of friends and family gathered near
A time when troubles faded, ever after
And joy was all we had to fear

We danced beneath the stars so bright
And laughed until we cried
With every passing moment, the night
Seemed like it could never die

Alas, time slipped away so fast
Leaving only a memory to hold
But that moment, I know, will forever last
Etched deep within my soul

So I sit and reminisce, and sometimes sigh
For that perfect moment that's forever missed
But in my heart, that memory will never die
And my soul will always be kissed.",1

A turquoise blue expanse.
Its beauty steals my breath away,
And makes my soul dance.

The water laps against the shore,
Serene and peaceful sound.

The mountains tower high above,
Their peaks dusted with snow.
Reflected in the tranquil lake,
A mirrored image below.

The trees stand tall and proud,
A verdant frame to this sight.
The wind whispers through their leaves,
A gentle lullaby for the night.

I stand in awe of such majesty,
A beauty beyond compare.
The lake, a sacred space of peace,
A place to escape life's despair.

Thank you, dear lake, for your gift,
For the peace that you bring.
I promise to cherish and protect you,
To let your beauty forever ring.",1

A journey of triumph, a path of might.
It mends the broken, it soothes the soul,
And makes the heart once again whole.

A respite from the chaos of life.
With each stitch, the wounds begin to mend,
And hope and joy once more descend.

Healing brings peace to the tired mind,
And leaves all fears and doubts behind.
It's a courage that pushes you to go on,
A strength that helps you carry on.

It fights away the shadows of doubt,
And replaces them with a sense of clout.
It instills the faith to face each new day,
And see the light in every single way.

Healing is a gift that we all embrace,
A chance to make the world a better place.
It's a seed that blossoms to a healing tree,
A symbol of hope for all humanity.",1

"It is not as though they dit down and say ""hey, I'm going to change who I am today, just for the fun of it!"" and if they do they aren't serious about changing. I have changed. A lot. It almost scares me how I have evolved as a person over the past several months. My thoughts have changed, how I view myself and other people, how I respond to certain situations, my opinions, beliefs, morals, attitudes; they have all been dramatically altered since this time last year. The funny thing about this is the reason why. I always considered myself to be a person set in my ways, never to step out of bounds, never to go against what I thought was socially acceptable. On a small scale, I was my own person, unique in every way, but in the scheme of life, I was right there with every other middle class high school girl. Trying to fit in, to wear the coolest clothes, listen to top 40 music, go to all the parties to make and appearance and be friends with certain people just because they were ""popular"". Then I met Cody, and I realized that there was so much more to life that what I was used to. The world wasn't one big happy carousel, spinning and singing and whoever got the prettiest horse was best. No, that's not how it was. There were problems in the world, and I realized that I had been ignorant to them, and it wasn't right. I came to realize that there is so much hatred and apathy out there, and it's tolerated. Not accepted, but tolerated, and that's wrong to. Cody taught me that it's okay to stand up for what I believe in, even if everyone else wasn't doing it, to do it for myself. Not to condone the racism, sexism, homophobia and bigotry that goes on behind closed doors. If we ignore it, it will only fester and grown until there's nothing anyone can do to stop it. I began to realize then that it doesn't matter if you're wearing Polo jeans, or if your parents just bought you a  brand new Mercedes, because in the scheme of things, it's all irrelevant and pointless. This message was made clear to me through Cody and the music we listen to. It's okay to be different, it's okay to spike your hair and pierce your eyebrow, because the people who frown upon you for doing so are the people who are afraid of change, the same people that tolerate that same hatred I previously mentioned. It's okay for me to be different as long I know that I'm doing what's rights, and the two should never be confused. You can be considered a social outcast and still contribute more to the well being of society than some big shot in his three piece armani suit, (the epitome of luxury that most people in America idolize today) sitting behind his desk letting his greed for power and money boil into hatred to the point that he will step over all those ""lower"" than him to get what he want's.

"The history of Madagascar is distinguished clearly from that of neighbouring islands by its unique blend of traditional and colonial influences. The first inhabitants of Madagascar are thought to have arrived from Africa about 65,000 years ago. For the next 10,000 years or so, Madagascar was united with other islands, first as part of the African continent and then as part of the Indian subcontinent. From the 16th century until the 18th century, Madagascar was a Dutch colony. In 1795 it became a French colony. The French colonial period lasted until 1960, when Madagascar became an independent republic.   Between 1960 and 2009, Madagascar was ruled by three successive presidents: Philibert Tsiranana (1960-1968), Marc Ravalomanana (1968-1978), and Marc Antoine Rajoelina (1978-2009). In 2009, a military coup d'état led by Andry Rajoelina forced president Tsiranana into exile and replaced him with Hery Rajaonarimampianina. Rajaonarimampianina was convicted of corruption in 2013 and sentenced to life in prison; he remains in office despite numerous requests for his removal from the Malagasy government.

"  Here is a possible essay on why math is a required subject and why it is so important:  Mathematics is the science of structure, order, and relation that has evolved from elemental practices of counting, measuring, and describing the shapes of objects1. It deals with logical reasoning and quantitative calculation, and its development has involved an increasing degree of idealization and abstraction of its subject matter1. Mathematics is not only an important subject in school, but also a vital skill for everyday life. In this essay, I will explain some of the benefits of learning math and how it can improve one’s quality of life.  One of the main reasons why math is important is that it promotes healthy brain function. Studies have shown that routinely practicing math keeps our brain healthy and functioning well2. Math challenges our brain to think critically, analytically, and creatively. It also enhances our memory, attention, and concentration. By doing math, we exercise our mental muscles and keep them sharp.  Another reason why math is important is that it improves problem-solving skills. Math teaches us how to approach problems systematically, logically, and rationally. It helps us develop strategies, methods, and algorithms to find solutions. It also trains us to check our work and verify our answers. These skills are useful not only for academic purposes, but also for personal and professional situations. For example, we can use math to plan a budget, manage our time, or troubleshoot a technical issue.  A third reason why math is important is that it opens up many opportunities for learning and career development. Math is the foundation of all sciences and helps us understand the world around us3. Math is essential in fields like engineering, physics, chemistry, biology, medicine, computer science, economics, and more. By learning math, we can explore various domains of knowledge and discover new things. Math also equips us with the tools and techniques to perform calculations, measurements, data analysis, modeling, simulation, and more. These abilities are in high demand in today’s society and can help us succeed in different professions.  In conclusion, math is a required subject because it is so important for our cognitive, practical, and educational development. Math enhances our brain function, improves our problem-solving skills, and opens up many opportunities for learning and career advancement. Math is not only a subject to be learned in school, but also a skill to be applied in life.   ",1
"Dog Man Star is the second album by English alternative rock band Suede, released in October 1994 on Nude Records. The album was recorded in London at Master Rock studios in early 1994, and was produced by Ed Buller. It was the last Suede album to feature guitarist Bernard Butler; growing tensions between him and singer Brett Anderson ended with Butler leaving the band before recording was complete. As a result, some tracks on the album had to be finished with the assistance of session musicians. In contrast to their debut album Suede, which exhibited the influences of David Bowie and the Smiths, Dog Man Star exhibits a more varied aesthetic and draws from a wider range of influences. Although it did not sell on the same scale as its predecessor, it reached number three on the UK Albums Chart and was certified as gold by the BPI in November 1994. Described by Rolling Stone as ""one of the most pretentious albums ever released by a major label,"" the record was released in a different UK musical climate to their hitherto discography. Out-of-step with the mainstream music scene, it featured the band diverting away from the ""Britpop pack"" of bands.",0

"Neonatal hypoglycemia occurs when the neonate's blood glucose level is less than the newborn's body requirements for factors such as cellular energy and metabolism. There is inconsistency internationally for diagnostic thresholds. In the US, hypoglycemia is when the blood glucose level is below 30 mg/dl within the first 24 hours of life and below 45 mg/dl thereafter. In the UK, however, lower and more variable thresholds are used (<18 mg/dl at any time OR baby with abnormal clinical signs and a single value <45 mg/dl OR baby at risk of impaired metabolic adaptation but without abnormal clinical signs and a measurement <36 mg/dl and remaining <36 mg/dl at next measurement). The neonate's gestational age, birth weight, metabolic needs, and wellness state of the newborn has a substantial impact on the neonates blood glucose level. There are known risk factors that can be both maternal and neonatal. This is a treatable condition. Its treatment depends on the cause of the hypoglycemia. Though it is treatable, it can be fatal if gone undetected.  Hypoglycemia is the most common metabolic problem in newborns. Neonatal hypoglycemia occurs in between 1 in 3 births out of every 1,000 births but is hard to quantify internationally due to lack of consensus about diagnostic thresholds.",0

"I once believed a lie so deep,
It kept me up at night to weep.
I let it consume my every thought,
Believing it was true, as if it were taught.

It said that love was just a game,
A way to win fortune and fame.
That people never truly care,
And trust is something you can't share.

I carried this lie close to my chest,
Thinking it was just for the best.
But the pain it brought me day by day,
Made me realize I was astray.

So I let go of that toxic tale,
And embraced what I knew to be real.
Love is not a game to play,
It's a feeling that guides the way.

Trust and care are not weak,
They make our connections peak.
The lie I believed was just a test,

"Morning glories, pale as a mist drying,
fade from the heat of the day, but already
hunchback bees in pirate pants and with peg-leg
hooks have found and are boarding them.
This could do for the sack of the imaginary
fleet. The raiders loot the galleons even as they
one by one vanish and leave still real
only what has been snatched out of the spell.
I’ve never seen bees more purposeful except
when the hive is threatened. They know
the good of it must be grabbed and hauled
before the whole feast wisps off.
They swarm in light and, fast, dive in,
then drone out, slow, their pantaloons heavy
with gold and sunlight. The line of them,
like thin smoke, wafts over the hedge.
And back again to find the fleet gone.
Well, they got this day’s good of it. Off
they cruise to what stays open longer.
Nothing green gives honey. And by now
you’d have to look twice to see more than green
where all those white sails trembled
when the world was misty and open
and the prize was there to be taken.",0
"Or is it on account of my radiant eye
I have lived so long?—I never slept
in the study hall, or called anyone
by an improper name. I never urinated in
a desolate synagogue. I never ate or drank
in a desolate synagogue or picked my teeth.
I did not walk into a desolate synagogue
in the summer just because of the heat,
nor in winter just because of cold rain.
Also, I know one may not deliver a eulogy
for an individual inside a desolate synagogue.
But you can read scripture inside a desolate
synagogue, or you can teach in a desolate
synagogue, or deliver eulogies for the community.
When synagogues are deserted they are
to be left alone and weeds allowed to grow.
One should not pick the weeds, lest there be
anguish that the synagogue is in ruins.
When are the synagogues to be swept
so that weeds do not grow inside them?
When they are in use.—When synagogues are
in ruins, weeds are not to be picked there.Because I know these things I was approved,
although unworthy, after a three-day oral
examination before the king of Sicily
to whom by custom the power of approval
is entrusted. Thereafter, I have worn the
laurel crown—my eye radiant to this day.",0
"A philatelic cover is an envelope prepared with a stamp(s) and address and sent through the mail delivery system for the purpose of creating a collectible item. Stamp collectors began to send mail to each other and to themselves early on, and philatelic mail is known from the late 19th century onward.  While some collectors specialize in philatelic covers, especially first day covers and cacheted covers, others regard them as contrived objects that are not reflective of real-world usage, and often will pay a higher price for a cover that represents genuine commercial use. However, mail sent by stamp collectors is no less a genuine article of postage than is mail sent with no concern of seeing the mailed item again. Philatelic covers include mail from first airmail flight and first day of stamp issues ceremonies. Over the years there have been numerous Expositions where special postmarks are made and where a post office is set up where mail can be sent from on the given date of the Expo'.  Like any other genuine item of mail these covers include postage stamps and postmarks of the time period and were processed and delivered by an official postal system. Often a philatelic cover will have more historical significance than randomly mailed covers as philatelic covers are also often mailed from the location on the date of an important or noteworthy event, like an inauguration or a space launch.

"James Thomas Eaglestone (24 July 1923 – 14 October 2000) was an English cricketer who played 60 first-class cricket matches, initially for Middlesex in 1947, before moving to Glamorgan for the 1948 and 1949 seasons. Known largely for his skills as a fielder – for he found only moderate success with the bat – Eaglestone enjoys the unusual distinction of having featured in two different County Championship-winning sides in consecutive seasons. Career Eaglestone was drawn to cricket after leaving school in 1938 when he joined the groundstaff at Lord's Cricket Ground. He played for the Middlesex Second XI that year. A left-handed batsman, Eaglestone enjoyed limited success after a promising debut first-class game for the Marylebone Cricket Club in which he scored 77 in a 128-run partnership with Denis Compton. Having securing selection for Middlesex, he scored zero in his first outing for the county side, and though he made 55 in his next game he would score only seven half-centuries during his career and finish with a batting average of 15.77.    Eaglestone played only seven matches for Middlesex in that solitary season for the club, scoring 151 runs. He decided to move to Glamorgan at the end of that year's County Championship – of which Middlesex were crowned champions. He played for Glamorgan in the 1948 season, and Glamorgan were victorious in that year's County Championship also – their maiden County Championship victory. This meant that Eaglestone had featured in Championship winning teams for two successive summers. His own contributions, however, were relatively modest. He scored 595 runs at 18.59 in the 1948 season and 341 runs at 11.36 in 1949.",0

The band tracked down producer Aaron Dessner to record the song at his studio in North Carolina.  ""Tongues"" is a slow-burning ballad about relationships and loss. According to Rolling Stone, the song ""draws on an unholy alliance of chamber pop and post-punk dynamics for a seemingly effortless elegance.""

"so far this freshmen year has been a intereasting adventure if you like S&M. I came down a month early to go with my friends to go to all these fraternity parties and meet a few musicians and audio engineers I have had correspondence with since I recorded my CD. The fraternity parties weren't that great except for a Kappa Sigma one that was pretty wild. I pledged for two days before it hit me that this was a waste of time. Not that waiting in endless lines (with endless hassles) to shell out more money to this fine universtity isn't making me age before my years. I am getting use to the regamorand of rude cafeteria & accounting people and trecking to classes in BFE. I can't say it's all been bad though I did get a free T-shirt and a lot of nefty junk people shove into your hands as you try to walk by. Oh, and then there are the roads with the none existent left turns, constant construction, 30-min limit parking (when you can find it), and cops that stop you for the fun of it. I don't know if its been- oh it gives you more space well then I can continue to ramble. College is supposed to be the best years some say. I think I should of keep better stock in my highschool years. Now except for parties I live like a reclouse in my apartment doing homework for a foriegn language I don't want to learn and trying to write more music while the people above me sound like there having basketball pratice up there.

"""Cheerleader"" is a song recorded by Jamaican singer and songwriter Omi. The track was written and produced by OMI and Clifton Dillon, Mark Bradford, and Ryan Dillon. OMI first began developing the song in 2008, when he created its melody. It was refined over several years alongside famed Jamaican producer Clifton Dillon. It was first recorded with veteran session musicians Sly and Robbie and Dean Fraser. Released as a single on independent label Oufah, the song saw success in Jamaica, where it topped the charts, and also attracted airplay in Hawaii and Dubai. Ultra contacted two disc jockeys to produce remixed versions of the original song. The label and song's producers preferred one remix, produced by a young German DJ, Felix Jaehn, that eschewed much of the song's original instrumentation for a tropical-flavored deep house rendition, prominently featuring a trumpet, a conga beat, and piano. A remix extended play was released in May 2015 by Ultra, which began to first see commercial success that fall. ""Cheerleader"" achieved commercial success in 2015, when it reached number one in 20 countries including the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, France, Mexico, Ireland, Sweden, and Germany.",0
" Dear Town Officials,  As a resident of this town for many years, I have seen the community evolve and grow. While there have been many positive changes, there is one area that I believe could use improvement. The issue I would like to address is the lack of access to public parks and green spaces in our neighborhood.  Studies have shown that access to public parks and green spaces can have a positive impact on the physical and mental health of residents. Green spaces can serve as a place for exercise, relaxation, and socialization. They also provide a space for children to play and explore nature.  Unfortunately, in our neighborhood, there are few public parks or green spaces. This is a problem that can be easily remedied with the creation of a new park or the improvement of an existing one.  A new park would not only benefit residents, but it would also attract visitors to our town. Parks and green spaces are often a selling point for families looking to move to a new area. By investing in a new park or improving an existing one, we could increase property values and stimulate economic growth in the community.  Additionally, a new park could provide opportunities for community engagement and volunteering. Residents could come together to maintain the park, organize events, and create a sense of community.  There are many options for creating a new park or improving an existing one. The town could convert an unused lot into a park or add amenities such as walking trails, playgrounds, and picnic areas to an existing park.  Investing in a new park or improving an existing one would be a wise decision for the town. The benefits to residents, visitors, and the local economy are clear. I urge the town officials to seriously consider this proposal and take action to improve our neighborhood.  Thank you for your attention to this matter.   ",1

" An ideal vacation is one that allows me to explore new places, cultures, and experiences, while also giving me time to relax and recharge. I would love to visit a destination that has a rich history, diverse scenery, and friendly people.   One possible destination that meets these criteria is Greece. Greece is a country that has a lot to offer for travelers who are interested in ancient civilizations, stunning landscapes, and delicious cuisine. I would start my vacation in Athens, the capital city and the cradle of democracy. I would visit the Acropolis, the Parthenon, and the National Archaeological Museum to learn more about the ancient Greeks and their achievements. I would also enjoy walking around the Plaka district, where I could shop for souvenirs, taste local delicacies, and watch street performers.  After spending a few days in Athens, I would take a ferry or a flight to one of the Greek islands, such as Santorini, Mykonos, or Crete. Each island has its own charm and beauty, but they all share some common features: white-washed houses, blue-domed churches, and breathtaking views of the Aegean Sea. I would spend my days on the island swimming in the crystal-clear water, sunbathing on the sandy beaches, and hiking on the volcanic trails. I would also explore the villages and towns on the island, where I could admire the architecture, visit the museums and galleries, and interact with the locals.  At night, I would enjoy the vibrant nightlife on the island, where I could dance at the clubs, listen to live music at the bars, or watch a movie at an open-air cinema. I would also sample the delicious Greek cuisine, such as moussaka, souvlaki, and baklava. I would try some of the local wines and spirits, such as ouzo and retsina. I would end my day by watching the sunset from my balcony or terrace, feeling grateful for the opportunity to experience such a wonderful place.  An ideal vacation for me is not only about seeing new sights and having fun activities. It is also about learning new things and gaining new perspectives. By visiting Greece, I would be able to immerse myself in a culture that has influenced many aspects of Western civilization. I would be able to appreciate the beauty and diversity of nature. I would be able to connect with people who have different backgrounds and lifestyles. I would be able to enrich my mind and soul with new knowledge and experiences.  An ideal vacation for me is also about finding balance and harmony. It is about having enough time to do what I want and what I need. It is about having enough space to be myself and to be with others. It is about having enough energy to explore and to relax. By visiting Greece, I would be able to achieve this balance and harmony. I would be able to enjoy both adventure and tranquility. I would be able to satisfy both my curiosity and my comfort.  An ideal vacation for me is one that leaves me with lasting memories and positive emotions. It is one that makes me feel happy and fulfilled. It is one that inspires me to travel more and to live more. By visiting Greece, I believe I would have such a vacation.     ",1

"Geneviève Janssen-Pevtschin (24 February 1915 – 11 November 2011), also known Ginette Pevtschin, was a Belgian lawyer and the first woman magistrate in Belgium. She also was a distinguished member of the Belgian Resistance during World War II. Biography  Born in Brussels on 24 February 1915 to Belgian Jewish parents of Russian descent, Geneviève Pevtschin studied law and graduated from the Free University of Brussels in 1937. She was barrister at the Brussels Court of Appeal from 1937 to 1948. When war broke out, she was barred from practicing law, when the German Military Administration passed an anti-Jew decree on 28 October 1940 banning Jews from government and public service positions and from the legal profession.

" Obesity is a complex and multifaceted problem that affects millions of people around the world. It is defined as having an excessive amount of body fat that poses a risk to health. Obesity can lead to both personal and societal problems, such as:  Personal problems: People with obesity are more likely to develop a number of potentially serious health problems, including: heart disease and strokes, type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, certain cancers, osteoarthritis, sleep apnea, gallstones, fatty liver disease, kidney disease, pregnancy complications, and mental health issues such as depression and low self-esteem12. Obesity can also affect the quality of life and well-being of individuals by limiting their mobility, social interactions, and opportunities for education and employment. Obesity can also increase the risk of discrimination, stigma, and bullying2. Societal problems: Obesity can have a significant impact on the society as a whole by increasing the burden on the health care system, the economy, and the environment. Obesity can increase the costs of health care services and medications due to the increased prevalence and severity of obesity-related diseases1. Obesity can also reduce the productivity and income of individuals and businesses due to absenteeism, presenteeism (working while sick), disability, and premature mortality2. Obesity can also contribute to environmental degradation by increasing the demand for food, energy, water, and land resources2. Therefore, obesity is not just a personal issue but a public health challenge that requires collective action and responsibility. A comprehensive approach that addresses the root causes and consequences of obesity is needed to prevent and manage this problem effectively. Such an approach should include strategies that promote healthy eating habits, physical activity, behavioral change, environmental modification, policy intervention, education and awareness, and medical treatment12. By working together, we can create a healthier and more sustainable future for ourselves and our society.      ",1

Through the darkness and the strife
It shines bright and pure within us
And gives meaning to our life

It is the force that drives us forward
In the face of every trial
And in its glow we find the courage
To walk every endless mile

And in its shining brilliance
We find the answers that we need

Leaning on strength, with all my might

For I will face it without fear
With courage planted deep within
I'll rise above this pain again.",1

She received her Bachelor of Arts degree in Anthropology from the University of Massachusetts in 1990 and went on to receive a PhD in Anthropology in 2001 from New York University. She currently lives in Philadelphia. She is currently doing research on street musicians in Condesa in Mexico City. Her research mainly focuses on performance practices, global and local contexts, and the political uses to which they are directed. Levi has performed ethnographic field work on lucha libre in Mexico City and the significance it has in the Mexican culture. Not only did she do ethnographic field work, but she also trained with a retired lucha libre wrestler and his students. Levi worked with this well respected wrestler for a year and a half and incorporated this as research into her book The World of Lucha Libre  This allowed Levi to view lucha libre as an arena that examined the connections between ideas of mestizaje, class, gender, aesthetic values, mass mediation, and the state. This thus led her to write her book The World of Lucha Libra in which these ideas are explored. In a Los Angeles Times interview in 2009 she described lucha libre created a unique, cross-class ""cultural phenomenon"" that put on a ""display of these larger-than-life heroes but heroes that everybody...knew [and] came from their social class.""",0
"Right now I'm a little bit depressed, not much has gone my way this week. I made some fabulous friends last week and we were all planning on going home together tomorrow, but now they seem not to want me to go with them. I don't know why everyone is getting mad all of the sudden, maybe it's something in the air. quite ridiculous, if you ask me. I have tears in my eyes as I'm typing, which is strange because I have tried so hard to not let little things get to me. My mom has always told me that I was overly sensitive, I thought I could overcome it, I think I can overcome anything. I had Mono a few years ago, and I overcame that one. My mind has not been forced to think in a while, people that I've talked to are just not to stimulating, I guess I should go and hang out in a coffee shop or something. I always thought college was going to be so much fun, and it's really not. I am this close to packing my bags and going home. Last week, I was the stereotypical college student and now, definitely not. My roommate and I are just not compatible, I mean she's a nice girl and all and she has good intentions, but I find her incredibly dull and childlike. She is a sophomore and I am a freshman. She has a really low self esteem and that's something that I don't deal well with, because I used to too. I don't like to think about those times, because I've overcome them. I fear that she is what I will become and it makes me resent her a bit. I don't want to live the life, or lack thereof, that she is leading. I make my life incredibly competitive, and I like to win. My cousin is down here, she rushed, she's actually in this class. But we've competed with each other all of our lives, whether the other one realized it or not, driving home, getting ready, meeting guys, they were all competitions. She and I are both incredibly stubborn too, so we butt heads quite often. I know that I've changed this year, and she has too, but we've changed differently. She's become more and more dependent on people, she can't be alone at all and I've become more and more independent of folks, for instance tonight, I walked over to the turtle pond and fed the fish, Carrie would freak out if someone told her to do that alone, but I really enjoyed myself tonight, I haven't felt that quiet peace in a long time down here. I don't know if UT is the right place for me, and I don't know. This is ridiculous. I'm here, and I'll graduate from here. Is this the sort of paper you're looking for? My mind is definitely not in a deep ponderous mood. This his how my mind works, worry after worry. I'd rather not get too far into myself here, if that's alright. On a happy note, I saw a guy in my Philosophy class today with absolutely Amazing hair. It was bleach blond and had four inch spikes! I admire people being gutsy enough to do that, never in my life would my hair be in spikes or fuchsia, I'll just stay the way I am. I miss my dog. I talked on the phone to my parents last night and I heard her bark in the background. I am ready to go home that's pretty much what has gotten me through this week. It has been the first time that I've gotten homesick. I think it's because I am going home tomorrow. Before, I didn't get homesick because I didn't allow myself to think about it too much, but I saw a Dallas Morning News today and got all choked up. What is all of this about anyway? Where do I benefit in the long run of living with someone I don't like and being forced to eat bad food? I'd much rather be in my own apartment. HA! My folks would really go for that one. They are so overprotective. The people that I was originally going home with are going to the Dave Matthews concert, and my mom won't let me go, I'm also not allowed to go to the TX v. OU game. That is stinky! I just need a good cry and a good nap and a hug from my grandma and everything will be fabulous again. I swear! If my roommate asks one more time if I want to talk about anything that's bothering me I will scream. I told her already that I'm writing a paper and she is still jabbering. Okay, Deep Breath. Back to Grandma. She is the cutest old lady in the entire world. She is definitely a cookiecutter grandma. It's fabulous. I told her I was coming home and she got so excited! My twenty minutes are up, but I feel much better now, I'm glad I got to take all of my emotion out on this essay rather than on my roommate!

"Yaron Tsur ((; born June 19, 1948), an historian of the Jews in the Muslim lands in the modern era, is amongst the founders of the Open University of Israel, a professor in the department of Jewish history at Tel Aviv University and a former chairperson of its graduate school of Jewish studies. He is a pioneer in the field of Digital Humanities in Israel and the founder of the ""Historical jewish press"" website. Yaron Tsur was born in Jerusalem to a German-Jewish father and to a mother of Yemenite extraction. During his childhood and youth in Jerusalem, he sojourned with his parents in the home of his Yemenite grandfather in the Nahlat Ahim neighborhood, on the border of the more established and well known Rehavia neighborhood. Subsequently, Tsur would reflect in the introduction to his Torn Community on how this unique residential setting would mold both his sense of ethnic belonging as an Ashkenazi-Mizrahi hybrid as well as his professional path as a historian.",0

"In combat sports such as boxing, an orthodox stance is one in which the boxer places their left foot farther in front of the right foot, thus having their weaker side closer to the opponent. Because it favors the stronger, dominant side—often the right side, see laterality—the orthodox stance is the most common stance in boxing and MMA. It is mostly used by right-handed boxers. Many boxing champions have fought in an orthodox stance. Alternative stances The corresponding designation for a left-handed boxer is southpaw and is generally a mirror image of the orthodox stance. A southpaw boxer guards and jabs with their right hand. Some famous boxers who use southpaw are Marvelous Marvin Hagler,   Victor Ortiz, Sultan Ibragimov, Naseem Hamed, Joe Calzaghe, Manny Pacquiao, and Lucian Bute. Francisco Palacios, Andre Ward, and Terence Crawford normally fight as orthodox, but occasionally switch to a southpaw stance to confuse their opponents. Hagler was the opposite, normally fighting southpaw but able to switch to orthodox. Some fighters who are naturally left-handed fight in the orthodox stance with the advantage of a fast, hard jab and left hook, including Oscar De La Hoya, Sonny Liston, Miguel Angel Cotto, Gerry Cooney, and Marco Antonio Barrera. Likewise, Vasiliy Lomachenko is a naturally right-handed fighter who stands in the southpaw stance, as the same with Shakur Stevenson.",0
"Ramsay Street is the fictional cul-de-sac in which the characters of the Australian soap opera Neighbours live. The street is set in the equally fictional Melbourne suburb of Erinsborough. Neighbours storylines primarily centre on the residents of the Street, which was named after Jack Ramsay, the grandfather of original character Max Ramsay (Francis Bell). Only six houses on the street are featured on a regular basis; numbers 22 to 32. Number 34 was featured for the first time in 2018. The cul-de-sac is at the end of a long street and the rest of the houses are on the other side of the main road which bisects it. A storyline within the show saw the name of the street nearly changed to Ramsbottom Street. Harold Bishop (Ian Smith) led a protest against it and won. Pin Oak Court, in Vermont South (at ), is the real cul-de-sac that doubles for Ramsay Street. All of the houses featured in the show are real and the residents allow Neighbours to shoot external scenes in their front and back gardens. Neighbours has been filmed in Pin Oak Court since the series began in 1985 and it has since become popular with tourists. Tours to the cul-de-sac run throughout the year. The interior scenes are filmed at the Global Television studios in Forest Hill, the adjoining suburb in which Pin Oak Court is located.",0
" I understand that having money in your savings account may not seem like a priority right now, but I want to emphasize how important it is to create and follow through with a savings plan. Here are a few reasons why:  Emergencies can happen at any time: You never know when you might need extra cash to cover unexpected expenses, such as car repairs, medical bills, or job loss. Having a savings account can give you peace of mind knowing that you have a safety net to fall back on when times get tough.  It can help you achieve your long-term goals: Whether you're saving for a down payment on a house, a dream vacation, or retirement, having a savings plan in place can help you reach those goals faster. By setting aside a little bit of money each month, you can make steady progress towards your financial aspirations.  It can help you avoid debt: If you don't have money saved up, you may have to rely on credit cards or loans to cover unexpected expenses. This can lead to a cycle of debt that is difficult to break free from. By having money saved up, you can avoid going into debt in the first place.  I know that saving money can be difficult, especially if you're living paycheck to paycheck. However, even small contributions to a savings account can add up over time. By creating a budget, cutting unnecessary expenses, and finding ways to increase your income, you can start building your savings account and securing your financial future.  Remember, it's never too late to start saving. Even if you can only set aside a small amount each month, every little bit counts. I hope this encourages you to start thinking about your savings plan and taking steps towards a more secure financial future.  Best regards,                ",1
"Sight, oh sight,
What a precious gift besides light.
A stunning world to behold,
A treasure trove of colors and stories untold.

With sight, we witness nature's glory,
The sunrise, the sunset, and all its mystery.
The stars twinkling in the night sky,
And the clouds that paint on high.

Through sight, we can read and learn,
Books and knowledge, to our brain it returns.
We can gaze at art with awe and wonder,
And see the beauty of human culture.

Sight connects us with other souls,
The sparkle in a lover's eye, it unfolds.
The tenderness of a child's smile,
And the happiness that is worth the while.

Without sight, the world would be dark and grey,
Silhouettes of things, apart from the day.
But with sight, we get to live a life,
A precious gift, that helps us thrive.",1
"  To prepare for a college admissions test, you should start by researching the test and its format. Find out what topics the test covers, how long it is, and what types of questions you can expect. Many college admissions tests, such as the SAT or ACT, also have practice tests available that you can take to get a sense of the format and types of questions.  Once you have an understanding of the test, develop a study plan that incorporates both reviewing the material covered on the test and practicing test-taking strategies. Some effective study strategies might include:  Creating a study schedule that allows you to review material over a longer period of time, rather than cramming at the last minute. Using flashcards to memorize important concepts and formulas. Practicing timed tests to improve your pacing and reduce test anxiety. Reviewing your mistakes and understanding why you got them wrong. Seeking out resources like textbooks, online videos, or tutoring services to fill gaps in your understanding of the material. It's also important to take care of your physical and mental health during your studying period. Make sure to get enough sleep, eat healthy foods, and exercise regularly. Additionally, practice stress-reducing techniques, like deep breathing or meditation, to help you stay calm and focused on test day.  Finally, remember that a college admissions test is just one part of the admissions process. Admissions committees will also consider other factors like your grades, extracurricular activities, and essays, so don't put all your eggs in one basket. Focus on doing your best on the test, but also remember to keep a balanced perspective on the college admissions process as a whole.    ",1
"""The Eddie"" is a big wave surfing tournament held at Waimea Bay on the north shore of Oahu, Hawaii.  The tournament is named for native Hawaiian, champion big wave surfer, and life-saving Waimea Bay lifeguard, Eddie Aikau.  Created in 1984 at nearby Sunset Beach, the invitational tournament moved to the notoriously big waved Waimea Bay, where Aikau's family maintains an ancestral tradition as caretakers of the Waimea Valley. It was formerly known as the Quiksilver in Memory of Eddie Aikau after its sponsor Quiksilver, but the company and the Aikau family could not agree to terms for a new contract after the previous one expired in 2016. Tournament format The tournament is known for a unique requirement that open-ocean swells reach a minimum height of  before the competition can be held. Open-ocean swells of this height generally translate to wave faces in the bay of  to . As a result of this requirement, the tournament has only been held nine times during the history of the event, most recently on February 25, 2016.",0
"In the icy and serene winter nights,
Where every sound, a silent note writes,
Amidst the gusts of frosty wind,
The melodies of winter's dream begin.

The whispers of the snowflakes,
Their gentle patters, a song they make,
With each a unique sound to play,
A symphony in white, night and day.

The rustles of the leafless trees,
A wooden orchestra through the breeze,
A concert of creaks and moans,
In tune with the winter tones.

The echoes of the frozen land,
A choir of ice crystals, grand,
With their frigid chimes, so clear,
A winter's melody, so dear.

So let us listen to the winter's song,
As it plays right where we belong,
For in its chill and tranquil seam,
We hear the dreams that winter's dream.",1
"Walking past the open window, she is surprised by the song of the white-throated sparrow and stops to listen. She has been thinking of the dead ones she loves--her father who lived over a century, and her oldest son, suddenly gone at forty-seven--and she can't help thinking she has called them back, that they are calling her in the voices of these birds passing through Ohio on their spring migration. . . because, after years of summers in upstate New York, the white-throat has become something like the family bird. Her father used to stop whatever he was doing and point out its clear, whistling song. She hears it again: ""Poor Sam Peabody Peabody Peabody."" She tries not to think, ""Poor Andy,"" but she has already thought it, and now she is weeping. But then she hears another, so clear, it's as if the bird were in the room with her, or in her head, telling her that everything will be all right. She cannot see them from her second-story window-- they are hidden in the new leaves of the old maple, or behind the white blossoms of the dogwood-- but she stands and listens, knowing they will stay for only a few days before moving on.",0

"HaeIII is one of many restriction enzymes (endonucleases) a type of prokaryotic DNA that protects organisms from unknown, foreign DNA. It is a restriction enzyme used in molecular biology laboratories. It was the third endonuclease to be isolated from the Haemophilus aegyptius bacteria. The enzyme's recognition site—the place where it cuts DNA molecules—is the GGCC nucleotide sequence which means it cleaves DNA at the site 5′-GG/CC-3. The recognition site is usually around 4-8 bps.This enzyme's gene has been sequenced and cloned. This is done to make DNA fragments in blunt ends. HaeIII is not effective for single stranded DNA cleavage. Properties HaeIII has a molecular weight of 37126. After a 2-10-fold of HaeIII takes place, there is overdigestion of a DNA substrate. This results in 100% being cut, more than 50% of fragments being ligated, and more than 95% being recut. Heat inactivation comes at about 80 °C for 20 minutes. The locus of the HaeIII enzyme is on AF05137, and is linear with 957 base pairs.",0

Back in that special place again 
Where my heart felt free 
And my soul was free from pain 

The smell of the sea 
Mixed with salty summer air 
The sand between my toes 
As I listened to the waves crash there 

The laughter of my friends 
Echoing in the open air 
The warmth of the sun 
As we basked without a care 

Oh, that place I miss 
Where happiness reigned supreme 
A world without sorrow 
Where joy was the only theme 

Though I cannot be there now 
My memories never fade 
For in my heart that place lives on 
And my love for it will never fade.",1

"November Group (Marraskuun ryhmä) was an association of Finnish expressionist artists, gathered around Tyko Sallinen.  The group was  founded in time when Finland  declared its independence from Russia and the members of the November Group were sometimes aggressively nationalistic in outlook, creating a distinctively Finnish form of Expressionism. The November group caused the greatest ever uproar in Finnish art. In the Finnish art community of its age it represented everything that was ugly, incompetent, distorting and primitive. Today the movement is considered one of the most important and influenced movements in Finnish art. Members of the group included Tyko Sallinen, Marcus Collin, Alvar Cawén, Juho Rissanen and Gabriel Engberg. These five had a group exhibition 17 November to 5 December 1917, and in decided to found a group during that exhibition.

"i don't know what to write. I think that the music next door is a little loud, and it always is at least when I'm trying to study. when you are trying to concentrate it always seems as noises are amplified, such as my roommate, studing, every turn of a page is very loud. She is studying biology, which is unusual because usually she complains about having to study, and now she is actually studying. I'm suprised she hasn't yet complained that my typing is bothering her. I hope it's not, but does it really matter. Anyways, I hope this is what I'm supposed to be writing about, and I really hope that grammer and punctuation are not observed too closely. I think it's time for dinner, well really I don't have a choice if I want to eat on campus, since everything closes at 7. It reminds me of my job at a retirement community, where everything closes very early. I wonder how my grades will be at the end of this semester. hopefully good, it's kind of difficult though because UT is so much different than my high school. I mean this class has 500 people tha's more than my entire high school, probably close to twice as big. But, it was my choice to come here and now I must adjust to my new life style. Being in a big city is so much different from a small town, the smell, the people, everything. Rather than the pleasent smell of trees, or the occasional smell of a BarBQ, there is a strong smell of trash and the numerous buses. But, again it is all okay, and with time everything will seem normal. Is that necessarily a good thing, I wonder. What am I going to do after college, no one can tell me what to do with my life, so I have to decide. But should we be forced to decide so soon, i mean we just graduated from high school. there are so many choices and paths to choose, and what if we choose the wrong one, will we be able to turn around and go back. I picked up a package today, my mom sent me some URHA gifts. It's a good thing I actually checked the mail. At home I used to check it everyday, but here I never remember. I miss home, my dogs and my family, but mainly being familiar with everything and everybody. It's difficult to meet people, well at least for me it is. I can't just start talking to someone I don't know, but how will i ever meet anyone that way. the streets are noisy, i think its all the college, probably male, students driving by, engines roaring and music blasting, it's okay if they do that, but i'm trying to think about what I should type. This assignment should be equiped with spell check, that way you would never have to use the backspace button, or key whatever it is called. I really don't know anything about computers, which is kind of sad because my mom works for a computer company. Maybe that's the reason, why do i need to know when i could ask her and she could tell me. I reallt don't know what else to say I'm thinking that I'm glad that time is almost up because there are not any other things to talk about. These desk chairs are quiet uncomfortable, another reason I'm glad time is almost up. I sure have watched the time closely haven't I.",0

"The Make-Up is an American post-punk band from Chicago, Illinois. Active from 1978 to 1992, the band was one of the earliest American bands to combine punk rock with heavy metal and progressive rock influences.  Formed in 1978, the Make-Up quickly became one of the leading lights of Chicago's burgeoning post-punk scene. Their blend of punk energy and heavy metal intensity placed them firmly at the forefront of a movement that was beginning to take shape in the city.   The Make-Up's self-titled debut album was released in 1980 and quickly established them as one of Chicago's most popular and influential bands. The album was well received by both critics and fans alike, earning them a reputation as one of the city's most promising new bands.   The following year saw the release of their second album, which saw the band expanding their sound further into progressive territory. The album was again well received by both fans and critics, and cemented the Make-Up's position as one of Chicago's leading post-punk outfits.   In 1982, the Make-Up released their third album, which marked a significant change in direction for the band. Recorded at Studio 4 in London with production by David Bowie producer Tony Visconti, the album saw the band abandoning their punk roots in favour of a more experimental sound.   Released in 1984, the album failed to achieve the same level of commercial success as their previous work, but it has since been recognised as one of the finest",1
"This is the first writing assignment I have had in college. I'm a little nervous. I don't know why I should be worried about this because at least this writing assignment is an interesting one. I've never written in a stream of consciousness. I just lost my train of thought. I tend to do that. Actually, I constantly go off on these tangents as I hold any conversation. It's quite annoying. But hey, it's me. It's about to rain outside. I was just telling a friend about how hilarious it was that everyone noticed that it was raining when one student left early during class yesterday. And Professor Pennebaker was totally right when he said noone was paying attention anymore to what he was saying because we were all thinking, ""How the hell am I going to get home now?"". I laughed for a long time after that, but I was still thinking about the rain. After I ran out of class I noticed a lot of people were prepared, and had their umbrellas with them. I also noticed that the people with these umbrellas who were walking with someone else without an umbrella, did not share their umbrella with the other person. Not one of them. I thought that was extremely odd. I have never used the word umbrella so many times in one sentence. I'm very sleepy now. The rain tends to have that effect on me. I love the rain, not just for that reason but it's also soothing. But I do hate when it rains right before, or when I am about to go out. It's a hassle that I haven't had to deal with for a long time. I'm thinking we are in the middle of a drought. I can't wait until winter either. That time of year makes me happy. I don't know why I keep referring to weather. I'm not one of those, ""It's lovely weather we are having today"", kind of person.",0
"I am an AI model language and cannot generate emotions. However, here's a poem that aligns with the given title:

A journey through timeless memories,

a path that leads to yesterday.

Where childhood dreams and faded hopes

linger in the mind to play.

The places that we used to love,

the people that we knew so well.

Their echoes resonate within,

a never-ending tale to tell.

The colors of a sunset sky,

the scent of summer in the air.

These memories they take us back,

to moments that we want to share.

We travel down this winding road,

to find the treasures we've left behind.

The laughter, love, and joy that grew,

in corners of our heart and mind.

A journey through timeless memories,

to a place that's always true.

A reminder of the life we lived,

and of the hope that we pursue.",1
"Global aphasia is a severe form of nonfluent aphasia, caused by damage to the left side of the brain, that affects receptive and expressive language skills (needed for both written and oral language) as well as auditory and visual comprehension. Acquired impairments of communicative abilities are present across all language modalities, impacting language production, comprehension, and repetition. Patients with global aphasia may be able to verbalize a few short utterances and use non-word neologisms, but their overall production ability is limited. Their ability to repeat words, utterances, or phrases is also affected. Due to the preservation of the right hemisphere, an individual with global aphasia may still be able to express themselves through facial expressions, gestures, and intonation. This type of aphasia often results from a large lesion of the left perisylvian cortex. The lesion is caused by an occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery and is associated with damage to Broca's area, Wernicke's area, and insular regions which are associated with aspects of language. Signs and symptoms It is most common for the onset of global aphasia to occur after a thrombotic stroke (at the trunk of the middle cerebral artery), with varying severity. The general signs and symptoms include the inability to understand, create, and repeat speech and language.  These difficulties also persist in reading, writing, and auditory comprehension abilities. Verbal language typically consists of a few recognizable utterances and words (e.g., hello), overlearned phrases (e.g., how are you), and expletives (e.g., a curse word). However, those affected by global aphasia may express themselves using facial expressions, intonation, and gestures.  Extensive lexical (vocabulary) impairment is possible, resulting in an inability to read simple words or sentences. Global aphasia may be accompanied by weakness of the right side of the face and right hemiplegia (paralysis), but can occur with or without hemiparesis (weakness). Additionally, it is common for an individual with global aphasia to have one or more of the following additional impairments: apraxia of speech, alexia, pure word deafness, agraphia, facial apraxia, and depression.",0
" The statement by Bob Dylan about success reflects a subjective viewpoint that can be interpreted in various ways.  On one hand, Dylan's definition of success may be valid for individuals who prioritize personal fulfillment over material wealth or external recognition. For such people, the ability to pursue their passions and hobbies while maintaining a healthy work-life balance could indeed constitute a sense of achievement.  On the other hand, for some people, success may involve striving towards a particular goal, such as professional success or financial stability. In this case, the statement might not fully capture what success means to them. These individuals might define success as achieving their ambitions, attaining a particular level of wealth or status, or contributing to society in some way.  Ultimately, the concept of success is highly subjective and varies depending on a person's values, beliefs, and life experiences. It is up to each individual to determine what success means to them and how they wish to pursue it. Some people may find that Dylan's definition of success resonates with them, while others may not.          ",1
" On one hand, some parents might argue that it is their responsibility to monitor their children's internet usage and protect them from potentially harmful content. They may feel that it is their duty to ensure that their children are not exposed to explicit images or dangerous material, which could negatively affect their mental and emotional well-being. Censoring websites with inappropriate content may be a way to limit the chances of children coming across such material.  On the other hand, other parents might argue that censorship is not the best solution. They may believe that children should be allowed to learn and explore on their own, without overly strict restrictions. Moreover, censorship can be difficult to enforce, as there are so many websites and online platforms with varying degrees of control over content. Even if parents manage to block certain sites or keywords, their children may still find ways to access inappropriate material through alternative channels.  Ultimately, it is up to individual parents to decide whether or not they should censor websites with inappropriate content. However, it is important for parents to strike a balance between protecting their children and allowing them to grow and learn independently. Communication with their children about responsible internet usage, as well as the potential risks of accessing inappropriate material, is also crucial in guiding them to make good decisions online. Additionally, there are various tools and resources available to parents, such as parental control software, that can help monitor and limit their children's online activities.       ",1
"That night we drank warm whiskey
in our parked car
beyond woods now lost to the suburbs,
I fell in love with you.
What waited was the war
like a bloody curtain,
and a righteous moment
when the lovely boy’s
spine was snapped,
then the long falling into hell.
But lately, you’ve been calling me
back through the years of bitter silence
to tell me of another river of blood
and of the highland’s
howl at dusk of human voices
blasted into ecstasy.
That night in sweet Lorain
we drank so long and hard
we raised ourselves
above the broken places,
mill fires burning
red against the sky. Why
is there no end
to this unraveling.",0

"The Colors of the Soul's Palette

In my mind's eye, I see a canvas,
Bold and bright, yet deep and complex.
It's a work of art that is so vast,
The colors of the soul's palette at their best.

Blues, greens, and purples intertwine
Like waves crashing and merging with time.
These hues evoke the depths of the sea,
A vastness of emotion that forever carries me.

And then there are the yellows and oranges,
Representing light and warmth of the sun's forces.
They bathe the canvas in a radiant glow,
A reminder of hope that lets our spirits grow.

Yet the canvas is not complete,
For it is always changing at its own beat.
It shifts and transforms; it ebbs and flows,
Like the mysteries that every soul knows.

And so, as I look upon this painting,
I am reminded that the colors are ever-changing,
That my soul is vast, deep, and complex,
And that my experiences paint the canvas text.

For the colors of the soul's palette,
Are the many emotions that we feel, and yet,
It is their vastness that defines each of us,
A beautiful reminder that we are all unique, thus.",1
" On one hand, bullying is a pervasive problem that can have serious consequences for both the victim and the perpetrator. It can lead to physical and emotional harm, as well as lasting psychological trauma. Additionally, bullying can negatively impact academic performance and overall well-being, creating an unsafe and hostile learning environment for students. In this sense, it is reasonable to argue that schools have a responsibility to address bullying, as they have a duty to ensure the safety and well-being of their students.  On the other hand, some may argue that bullying is primarily a parental responsibility, and that schools should not be tasked with addressing this issue. Parents are often in the best position to recognize the warning signs of bullying behavior and to intervene early on. Furthermore, schools may not have the resources or expertise to adequately address complex social and emotional issues such as bullying. In this sense, it may be argued that schools should focus on providing academic instruction, leaving social and emotional development to parents.  Ultimately, whether schools should address bullying or leave it to parents depends on various factors, such as the severity of the bullying, the resources available to the school, and the role of parents in preventing and addressing bullying behavior. However, it is generally recognized that bullying is a serious issue that requires a collaborative effort between schools, parents, and communities to effectively prevent and address.

" Yes, I agree that we can lie with silence as well as with words. Silence can be used to deceive, manipulate, and conceal the truth just as effectively as words.  For example, consider a scenario where a friend asks another friend if they like their new outfit. The friend doesn't say anything, and their silence can be interpreted in different ways. They might not like the outfit but don't want to hurt their friend's feelings, or they might not care about the outfit at all. Alternatively, they might like the outfit but are too shy to say anything. In any case, their silence can be interpreted in multiple ways, and the interpretation might not be the truth.  Another example is when someone remains silent instead of speaking up when they witness injustice or unethical behavior. This silence can be seen as complicit and can contribute to the perpetuation of harmful actions. In this case, silence is a form of lying by omission.  In conclusion, silence can be just as powerful as words when it comes to conveying meaning, and it can be used to deceive or manipulate just as effectively as words can. It's essential to be aware of the potential for deception through silence and to communicate clearly to avoid misunderstandings.    ",1

"However, after becoming sick I began to notice how much I was dependant on my mother to help me , and take me to the doctor and pick up any medicines I needed. Now I have to do it all on my own. I had to wake up in the middle of the night and take myself to the hospital, I had to pick up my medicine, I was now the one who signed the form for my treatment to occur, not my mother. Now it is all me, and in a way that kind of frightens me. I now have to wonder if I am doing things right, or if I am screwing things up. Also, I keep thinking about going home this weekend for the first time, and I am not quite sure if I feel ready to see some of the people I graduated with. I am really excited about seeing my parents and friends, but I am really dreading going to my former high school's football game. Then all of this brings up another thought into my mind. Everyone so going to make comments on the fact that I still don't have a boyfriend, or that I am too picky when it comes to guys, and all of that other mess. All of this seems so superficial when I look at it, but this is the stuff that I have been thinking about. I have met several guys that I am really interested in, but it seems like there is always a problem. I always seem to be able to pick things out about guys and turn a perfectly good guy into a loser. I can pretend that I like a guy to suppress my feelings for wanting to be with somebody, but I can't last more than two weeks with that person. I can try and try to make things work out but I always seem to push guys away, which my other believes is her fault because of her and my father's divorce or something like that. I just seem to get scared when a guy gets to close to me. All through high school, all of my friends dated the same guy, and I was the one who had a different guy in every dance picture.

"It is really bright in here. Maybe I should turn on of the lights off. I would except I'm writing a stream of consciousness. I really miss Byron. I just talked to him about 10 minutes ago, but I need to talk to him again. Boy, is my cell phone bill going to be high this month. Haha. I still haven't paid mom for last months bill. I probably should have read chapter 3 before starting this, since it is due tomorrow and this isn't due until the 12th, but I would more than likely had waiting until the last minute if I hadn't gotten this over now. Whoops. My poster looks like it is about to fall down. Oh well, I'm to tired to go and put it back up. Yet, I am still awake enough to sit here and type for 20 minutes. I wonder how much people write for this if they are slow typers. And I wonder if they read every one of these. Especially since mine is going to be so long because of my typing speed. Man, if I were a slow typer this would be a lot less work. And if I wasn't so diligent about punctuation, capitalization, and spelling. Haha. Instead of spelling I accidentally wrote sleeping and had to erase it. I wonder if that is my subconscious trying to tell me something. I'm so glad I finished that photo wall. It turned out really nice, but Stephanie didn't seem to like it too much because she didn't have quite as many pictures as I did to put up. Oh well, that's her problem. Man, my DVD's are really out of order. I'm not sure why I think they need to be in any order at all, because in the grand scheme of things, that really doesn't matter quite that much. You know what would really suck would be if my computer, out of the blue caught a virus while I was in the middle of this, and I would have to start all over again. Then I would just wait until the last minute and probably not type quite so much. Oh well, this is for science I guess. Man I really really miss Byron. I can't believe I got so upset today when I was driving home, but what can you do when you love somebody so much. I don't know how his brother is related to him, he is so strange. At least he is nice I guess. I wonder if his blindness was caused from his genes or from some other problem when he was born. I guess that really isn't my business, but I'm just so damn curious. Byron didn't seem to know, so I guess I'll never find out unless I ask him, and I don't know him quite well enough to do that. Man, my pinky is really starting to cramp up. I don't think I've written for 8 minutes straight before without taking a break. I hope my Calculus quiz tomorrow isn't bad, I did the homework and everything and my professor swears that it is enough preparation for his quizzes, but yet I still remain cynical. I guess I'll just go over the homework problems again before I go to sleep. I can't wait until that Royal's show comes on A and E. Wow, I was so lazy I didn't even bother to find the and symbol. Haha. I did it again. If I wasn't on this laptop I wouldn't have a problem finding it. I wish it came with a 10 key pad. Byron. Byron. I can't stop thinking about that boy. He is such a sweet heart, and I can't wait to finish college so I can spend all my time with him. I wonder where A & E is. Haha. I found the & symbol. I wonder if there is some way that I can find out the channels on the internet through UT's website. Man this is a hell of a lot of typing. Hey hey, I see my Monkees bobble heads. They are so strangely entertaining. That's the only reason why I'm going to watch the A&E special, (davy jones is on it wahoo). That, and because Byron said he was going to watch it. There's the picture I have of us!  I can't stop looking at it or thinking about him!  I'm sure whoever (if anyone) reads this will wonder who Byron is (though it's pretty obvious). I hope Archie allows him to stay over at his dorm so he can come visit next weekend, and I don't have to drive back to San Antonio again. I don't mind driving down there, it might just be nice to have a change of scenery and have Byron visit up here. I'm going to be so worried about him though because he has to wait until he gets off of work to drive up here. There are to many drunk people out on the street for him to be safe, even though I trust his driving abilities. I think I'll have him call periodically on his way up here, just so I know that he is alright. Ya, that's a good idea. I should probably go and put those batteries into my remote but I don't want to get up and find it, nor am I suppose to get up from this typing and do something else. Man, Steph drank all my Hi-C. Or did I drink it all?  Naw. Steph did. I distinctly remember having at least 2 left in there when I left on Thursday. I don't drink her stuff. Oh wait, I did but she told me I could have some. Man, that whip cream I got on my face earlier from the Frappacino still hasn't come off after washing my face twice. I can still smell it. Eww. It smells like babies vomit. Byron!  Why aren't you here with me right now!  I know why you aren't here, but I wish you were!  Someday I won't have to worry about where you are all the time, and wonder what you are doing, but for right now this is torture!  Especially since I am writing all my thoughts down, and these thoughts of you are more obvious to me than normal!  All the thought I have in-between are meaningless because I don't consciously notice them, but when I'm thinking about you it takes all my concentration and full attention!  I should probably try and not think about missing you during class, but I can't stop. IT isn't like I don't mind these ideas, I just know that I won't be paying attention to what I should be. Hurray I'm almost out of time. 19 minutes. and a few seconds. Steph needs to put her stuff away and keep it away from my side of room. What is up with this. I'm not going to clean up after her. I'm getting so annoyed with her sleeping habits, but what can I do. I love you Byron!  I want to drive up there right now but I can't because of class!",0

I've kinda gotten into the school mood now so it's not too hard to sit down and get stuff done like it was a couple days ago. when I got here I had no clue it was going to be just what I thought is was going to be like. needless to say, I'm happy. it feels just like a movie or something. I'm so lucky to have such a great roommate. she's so awesome. we knew eachother in high school but we never were great friends so it works out perfect. we always can feel free to go our separate ways and always have someone to come home to and share our nights with. we are so much alike and so much different that God sure put us in the right place. we make eachother laugh. she even hooked me up the other night with one of her friends and I had a great time. we were discussing something last night though. we haven't seemed to find our nitch yet. we've met a lot of people, together and separatly, but I guess it just takes awhile to find your friends huh?  I'm not too worried or depressed about it yet. I'm busy as it is. friends will come. I wish matt from orientation calls me. I think we could be really good friends. I'm pretty upset with some of my friends right now. mainly blake. my old best guy friend. we used to be so tight but now he's changed. all he cares about is partying and drinking and keeping an image. it's so not him and he knows it. he is so much better than that and we've even talked about it before. I just care for him and miss him but both of us are too stubborn to call first and stuff like that. we've always been that way. let me tell you, senior year with him was pretty stressful. I just wish sometimes things were what they used to be. don't get me wrong. I absolutely love college but I guess I miss all of the tight friendships I had and my little group at school. but I love everything about college (except for the showers) :)  well, that's it for now. besides the fact that I wish I had some significant other. or maybe I don't. sometimes I wish I did but I still enjoy looking at other guys and flirting and I'm still meeting people now so I guess it's good I'm not tied down. and I'm really excited I found a theater club I could join here. and I don't have to major in theater. I did a lot of that in high school (hated my teacher) but I was a role model to a lot of people and that made it easier to cope with her. I'm so glad that we have email today. it makes it such an easier way to talk and communicate with people. I miss my friends and family the most. I'm not really homesick yet, which is good I think. I think that shows a sign of maturity. I'm not going home this weekend. I know my parents would want me to but I don't really feel like it yet. I propbably will the next weekend maybe. I know I am for our high school's homecoming for sure. I think that everyone from my school that goes here is going back. I think that it will be fun. I loved high school football games.

"  On the one hand, computer communication can help shy people express themselves more freely and confidently, as they have more time to think about what they want to say and can revise their messages before sending them. This can be especially beneficial in work settings, where people may need to communicate with colleagues or clients they have never met in person.  On the other hand, relying too much on computer communication can hinder our ability to develop interpersonal skills and form meaningful relationships. For example, when we communicate in person, we can pick up on nonverbal cues such as tone of voice, facial expressions, and body language, which can help us better understand the emotions and intentions of the other person. These nonverbal cues are often lost or misinterpreted in computer communication, which can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications.  Moreover, computer communication can be impersonal and isolating, as it lacks the warmth and intimacy of face-to-face interaction. When we communicate in person, we can share experiences and emotions more deeply, which can create stronger bonds and foster more meaningful relationships.  Therefore, I believe that computer communication can be a useful tool, but it should not be relied on exclusively. We should strive to balance our use of technology with face-to-face interaction, as this can help us develop interpersonal skills, build stronger relationships, and enhance our overall well-being.

" Music is an art form that transcends time, and as such, it is capable of resonating with people from different generations. The music that I grew up listening to may not be the same as what people from other generations enjoy, but that does not mean that it is not worth listening to. In fact, I believe that my generation's music is worth listening to, even if you are not from the same generation.  One of the reasons why I believe that my generation's music is worth listening to is because of the emotions that it conveys. Music has the power to make us feel things that we may not be able to express in words. The music of my generation speaks to the struggles and challenges that we face as young people trying to navigate a complex and ever-changing world. It addresses issues such as identity, social justice, and mental health, which are relevant not just to my generation but to everyone.  Another reason why my generation's music is worth listening to is that it represents a fusion of different genres and cultures. In today's globalized world, music has become more diverse and eclectic than ever before. My generation's music draws inspiration from various sources, including hip hop, R&B, rock, and electronic dance music. It also incorporates elements from different cultures, such as Latin, African, and Asian music. This diversity of influences makes the music of my generation both unique and exciting.  Finally, my generation's music is worth listening to because it is a reflection of the times we live in. Music has always been a reflection of society, and my generation's music is no different. It reflects the values, beliefs, and attitudes of young people today, who are more socially conscious, politically active, and open-minded than ever before. It is music that celebrates diversity, inclusivity, and equality, and that encourages us to be our best selves.  In conclusion, my generation's music is worth listening to because it speaks to the emotions, represents a fusion of different genres and cultures, and reflects the times we live in. It may not be the same as the music that people from other generations grew up listening to, but that does not mean that it is any less valuable or meaningful. So, I encourage you to give it a chance, and who knows, you might just discover a new favorite song or artist!         ",1

"Wyatt resteth here, that quick could never rest;
Whose heavenly gifts increased by disdain,
And virtue sank the deeper in his breast;
Such profit he of envy could obtain.
A head, where wisdom mysteries did frame,
Whose hammers beat still in that lively brain
As on a stith, where some work of fame
Was daily wrought, to turn to Britain’s gain.
A visage, stern and mild; where both did grow,
Vice to condemn, in virtues to rejoice;
Amid great storms whom grace assured so,
To live upright and smile at fortune’s choice.
A hand that taught what might be said in rhyme;
That reft Chaucer the glory of his wit;
A mark the which (unperfited, for time)
Some may approach, but never none shall hit.
A tongue that served in foreign realms his king;
Whose courteous talk to virtue did enflame
Each noble heart; a worthy guide to bring
Our English youth, by travail unto fame.
An eye whose judgment no affect could blind,
Friends to allure, and foes to reconcile;
Whose piercing look did represent a mind
With virtue fraught, reposed, void of guile.
A heart where dread yet never so impressed
To hide the thought that might the truth avaunce;
In neither fortune lift, nor so repressed,
To swell in wealth, nor yield unto mischance.
A valiant corps, where force and beauty met,
Happy, alas! too happy, but for foes,
Lived, and ran the race that nature set;
Of manhood’s shape, where she the mold did lose.
But to the heavens that simple soul is fled,
Which left with such, as covet Christ to know
Witness of faith that never shall be dead:
Sent for our health, but not received so.
Thus, for our guilt, this jewel have we lost;
The earth his bones, the heavens possess his ghost.

"I tend to shy away
From a veggie green and leafy
Brussel sprouts cause me dismay,
Their taste for me is too beefy.

I know they're packed with vitamins 
And full of healthy greens 
But thoughts of them induce nausea
And make me want to intervene.

I try to give them chances
And roast them up with care 
But despite my efforts
Their taste I cannot bear.

Perhaps one day I'll change my mind 
And give these sprouts a try 
Until then, I'll stick to veggies
That don't make me want to cry.",1
" Thomas Edison's statement suggests that genius is not just about having great ideas or inspiration, but it is more about the hard work and effort put into bringing those ideas to fruition. In other words, Edison emphasizes that successful outcomes require a great deal of work and persistence, not just talent or inspiration.  While it is true that hard work and persistence are essential for achieving success, it is also important to acknowledge that creativity and inspiration are equally crucial. Great ideas and innovative solutions come from inspiration, imagination, and a different perspective on things, which are not necessarily a result of hard work alone.  Therefore, while Thomas Edison's statement highlights the importance of hard work in achieving success, it should not undermine the value of creativity, imagination, and innovation in the process. Both elements are essential in achieving great results, and they complement each other to bring about exceptional outcomes.      ",1
"The caper story is a subgenre of crime fiction.  The typical caper story involves one or more crimes (especially thefts, swindles, or occasionally kidnappings) perpetrated by the main characters in full view of the reader. The actions of police or detectives attempting to prevent or solve the crimes may also be chronicled, but are not the main focus of the story.  The caper story is distinguished from the straight crime story by elements of humor, adventure, or unusual cleverness or audacity. The main characters often have comical idiosyncrasies and the law enforcement individuals are characterized by ineptitude or inadequacies. The criminals comically plan a crime with details unnecessary for the nature of the crime and humour is created when their personalities clash and their quirks are exposed.  For instance, the Dortmunder stories of Donald E. Westlake are highly comic tales involving unusual thefts by a gang of offbeat characters — in different stories Dortmunder's gang steals the same gem several times, steals an entire branch bank, and kidnaps someone from an asylum by driving a stolen train onto the property.  By contrast, the same author's Parker stories (published under the name Richard Stark) are grimly straightforward accounts of mundane crime — the criminal equivalent of the police procedural. Others, such as Lawrence Block's Bernie Rhodenbarr novels, feature a role reversal, an honest criminal and crooked cop, and the use of burglar Rhodenbarr's criminal talents to solve murders.",0
" Advocates for a complete ban on smoking in restaurants and bars argue that it is necessary to protect the health of workers and customers. Secondhand smoke is a known carcinogen and can cause lung cancer, heart disease, and other serious health problems. The separate smoking and non-smoking sections in restaurants are not effective in protecting people from secondhand smoke because the smoke can easily travel through the air conditioning system or other openings.  In addition to health concerns, some argue that a complete smoking ban would improve the overall atmosphere of restaurants and bars. Smoke can be unpleasant for non-smokers, and the smell can linger long after smokers have left. A smoke-free environment would be more pleasant for everyone and could attract more customers.  On the other hand, opponents of a complete smoking ban argue that it would infringe on the rights of smokers. They argue that smoking is a personal choice and that smokers should be allowed to smoke in designated areas. Some also argue that a complete smoking ban would hurt businesses that rely on smokers as customers.  In conclusion, the debate over whether to ban smoking in all restaurants and bars is complex and involves balancing health concerns with personal freedoms and economic considerations. Ultimately, the decision should be based on a careful evaluation of the evidence and the needs and preferences of the community.             ",1
" Building a birdhouse can be a fun and rewarding experience. Here are some steps to guide you through the process:  Materials needed:  Wood boards (cedar or pine) Saw Drill and bits Screws Wood glue Sandpaper Paint or wood stain Ruler or measuring tape Pencil Instructions:  Choose the type of birdhouse you want to build. There are many styles and designs to choose from, so do some research to find one that suits your needs.  Purchase the necessary materials. Cedar or pine wood boards are great for birdhouses because they are durable and weather-resistant. You will also need screws, wood glue, sandpaper, paint or wood stain, and a ruler or measuring tape.  Cut the wood boards to the appropriate size using a saw. For a basic birdhouse, you will need four pieces of wood: two sides, a front, and a back. The roof can be made from a single piece of wood or two pieces angled together.  Mark the entry hole on the front panel. The size of the entry hole will depend on the type of bird you want to attract. A 1.5-inch hole is good for attracting bluebirds, while a 1.25-inch hole is better for chickadees and nuthatches.  Drill the entry hole using a drill and a hole saw or spade bit.  Assemble the birdhouse by gluing and screwing the sides, front, and back panels together. Make sure the entry hole is facing forward and the bottom of the birdhouse is open for drainage.  Sand the birdhouse to remove any rough edges or splinters.  Paint or stain the birdhouse to protect it from the elements and make it look more attractive to birds.  Install the birdhouse in a safe and appropriate location. Make sure it is mounted securely and at the appropriate height for the type of bird you want to attract.  By following these steps, you can build a beautiful and functional birdhouse that will provide a safe and cozy home for your feathered friends.  ",1
"Nature's Beauty

Oh nature, how you enchant us,
With your colors, shapes, and smells, 
Your beauty is truly wondrous,
And in it, our hearts often swell. 

The vibrant green of a dense forest,
The tranquil blue of a calm ocean,
The fiery reds of a sunset,
All leave us in awe and emotion. 

Each season brings its own magic,
Spring blossoms, summer's warmth,
Fall's golden leaves, winter's blanket,
All nature's gifts, so ripe and warm. 

The buzz of bees, the songs of birds,
The rustling leaves of tall trees,
The crashing waves on sandy shores,
All bring peace and serenity. 

And in this world of concrete and steel,
Nature reminds us of what is real,
A bounty of life, free for all to feel,
Nature's beauty, an endless appeal.",1
"The scent of pig is faint tonight
as the lime trees hang their heads against gradations of blue,
looking at the lone suitcase in the middle of the farmyard
with a sense of solidarity. Also forgotten.
Its owner never once looked up at them and exclaimedI was still soft-fingered when I planted you.
In the plane, her gaze rests on a flock of cloud-birds,
pinkish purple with elongated necks, rests
on the plane’s wing-tip colored pink by the sun.
Her head is heavy with this childhood cargo,
like the hawk that usually flies between or above their branches,
found skimming the ground with its catch of mouse or mole,
or the barge that passes every day at four, its metal nose
just out of the water, while empty at eight, its sleek sides
flash signals to those on shore. Later, on the highway
a row of trucks lit like orange squares in the setting sun—
a colony of ants each with a piece of chrysanthemum
on their backs—begins to reassemble memories;
the petals become lining, the shape of the flower is lost,
so that years later, looking at an old photograph,
she will not remember the names of cousins and uncles
but the exact bend in the river behind them, the pattern of trees.",0

" On the one hand, machines have undoubtedly eliminated much of the manual labor previously required in various industries, resulting in increased efficiency and productivity. Automation has brought about many benefits, including faster production times, reduced labor costs, and improved quality control. For example, in the manufacturing sector, machines can produce items with greater accuracy and speed than humans, and robots can perform repetitive tasks with consistency and precision.  On the other hand, the widespread adoption of machines has led to the displacement of many workers who were once employed in industries that have become automated. This displacement can lead to unemployment and social upheaval, particularly in regions where industries have been the main source of employment. Additionally, machines can eliminate the need for skills previously required for certain jobs, leading to a potential loss of expertise and knowledge. For example, a farmer who previously had to know how to harvest crops by hand may no longer require that skill with the advent of harvesting machines.  In conclusion, while machines have brought about significant benefits in terms of increased efficiency and productivity, they have also resulted in significant job displacement and the potential loss of skills and expertise. Therefore, it's essential to find a balance between technological advancement and the preservation of skills and knowledge, ensuring that the benefits of automation are equitably distributed.

" A school is a place where students receive formal education and instruction from teachers or instructors. Schools can range from early childhood education centers to universities, and they can be public or private.  A typical school consists of classrooms where students attend lectures and participate in activities and discussions, libraries where they can access learning materials, laboratories for conducting experiments, and recreational areas where they can socialize and engage in physical activities.  Schools often have a structured curriculum that is designed to provide students with a broad and balanced education. The curriculum typically includes subjects such as math, science, language arts, social studies, physical education, and the arts. Students are assessed on their knowledge and skills through various forms of testing and evaluation.  In addition to academic instruction, schools also often provide students with opportunities for personal and social development. This can include extracurricular activities such as sports, music, theater, and clubs, as well as programs focused on character education, community service, and leadership development.

" On the one hand, some people argue that a politician's private life should be of little concern to the public. They believe that what politicians do in their private lives is irrelevant to their ability to govern and make decisions that affect the public. Furthermore, they argue that the media's excessive focus on the personal lives of politicians can distract from more important issues and potentially damage their reputation unfairly.  On the other hand, others argue that a politician's private life is relevant to their ability to govern and make decisions that affect the public. They believe that a politician's personal values and behavior can provide insight into their character and decision-making abilities. Additionally, they argue that a politician's behavior in their private life can be an indication of their honesty, integrity, and commitment to public service.  Moreover, some argue that a politician's personal behavior can have implications for their political decisions. For example, if a politician has a history of infidelity, they may be more susceptible to bribery or other forms of unethical behavior. Similarly, if a politician has a history of substance abuse or addiction, they may not be able to make sound decisions regarding drug policy.  In conclusion, the question of whether we should be concerned with the private affairs of politicians is complex, and opinions vary. Ultimately, the decision of how much weight to give to a politician's personal life is up to the individual voter. However, it is essential to consider the potential implications of a politician's behavior on their ability to govern and represent the interests of the public.                 ",1
"  On the one hand, some people feel that credit card companies taking advantage of students on college campuses is unethical. Students are often low on cash and may not fully understand the terms and conditions of credit card agreements, which could lead them to accumulate debt they cannot afford to pay off. Furthermore, credit card companies may offer incentives that may be enticing to students, such as free T-shirts or other merchandise, which can be seen as a predatory tactic to lure them into signing up for credit cards.  On the other hand, some people argue that credit card companies offering credit to students can help them begin to build credit and learn financial responsibility. Students who are responsible with their credit cards can start building a credit history, which can help them in the future when they apply for loans or mortgages. Additionally, credit card companies may offer lower interest rates and other perks for students who maintain a good credit score, which can be helpful for them financially.  Overall, whether credit card companies offering credit to students is beneficial or exploitative is a complex issue that depends on individual circumstances. Students should educate themselves on the terms and conditions of credit cards and their own financial situation before deciding whether to apply for credit cards. It is essential to use credit responsibly and pay off balances in full each month to avoid accruing high-interest charges and accumulating debt.         ",1

"Dnestr radar  and Dnepr radar , both known by the NATO reporting name Hen House are the first generation of Soviet space surveillance and early warning radars. Six radars of this type were built around the periphery of the Soviet Union starting in the 1960s to provide ballistic missile warnings for attacks from different directions. They were the primary Soviet early warning radars for much of the later Cold War. In common with other Soviet and Russian early warning radars they are named after rivers, the Dnestr and the Dnepr. The Dnestr/Dnepr radars were intended to be replaced by the newer Daryal radars starting in the 1990s. Only two of the planned Daryal radars became operational, due to issues such as the dissolution of the Soviet Union. As of 2012, the Russian early warning network still consists of some radars of this vintage. It is likely that all the existing radars will be replaced by the third generation Voronezh radars by 2020.",0

And feel a sense of peace inside
That grows and grows as I abide.

That nature made with firm intent
To teach us all to be content.",1

"I hope that this isn't a big deal, as I have to write for 20 minutes in a completely random manner. If I get graded on content or grammar, I'm simply done now. I've been caring a lot about my grades so far and I'm going to need to keep it up to get into law school at someplace like Georgetown or Columbia. I actually miss NYC a lot, but its a nice change down here and I'm happy to get out of Connecticut. I do miss my family a little, but I think they are doing fine and I'll be seeing them in no time. I'm glad my dad is going to be at the lacrosse tournament in Vegas come October. Still can't believe we lost in the state semi's to crappy Amity. That one kid was really good though. Maybe playing at UT will be just as fun and we'll have success. Seems like Texas lacrosse is nothing to ours, but I shouldn't get cocky yet. Its only a club team. Nobody better come in my room even though the door is open. Don't feel like being social, and its late. Its annoying that dumb Mark always locks it too every single time one of us is out of the room for five seconds. In fact, Mark is annoying in general. He seemed fine when we talked online prior to coming here, but he reminds me of Mendelson at home so much. I don't do well with these leech people too, I wish he wouldn't follow me around. But you know what, he is a really nice kid and I feel terrible saying these things, especially in some assignment that someone is reading. At least I'm nice to him in person. Waking up to him puking this morning was not cool either. ah he is awake, he better not get up here and read the screen like he always does. bah. Its funny coming to college after you're used to your friends at home. I'm glad that I don't know anyone and I'm on my own. You get to the point where you expect things of people and you know your friends so well, so coming here puts you out of your element for a bit. I think I'm meeting decent people though and I only expect to meet more and more cool people. At first I was pretty skeptical about everyone, but that's just because I was missing the guys I've had a good time with for years. Time to move on. plus I always said I needed to get out of little lame Brookfield. Zebrahead is the bomb. I don't think I ever get tired of their music. I'd like to see them in concert again sometime soon but they don't really have any dates posted. And IF I do see them again, I'm going to chill towards the back and just listen. Being up front was crazy, but its hard to enjoy sometimes when you have some annoying girl giving you elbows to the kidneys and her nappy sweaty weave is sticking to your clothes and skin. But hey, its the price you pay I suppose. Radio 104 fest was still probably the most fun of all concerts though, hahahahh especially when we dropped that girl that was crowd surfing and kicking people in the faces on purpose and she started bleeding. Its horrible I know, but its really not cool what she was doing. Plus, she was not seriously injured. girls shouldn't crowd surf anyways, there are too many dirtbag guys who are just trying to crop a feel. HAHA Like that one guy who ripped the girl's thong off. Speaking of which, I need to meet some more girls here. Emily has completely drained me over the past two years and I'm glad that I can finally be away from her and her attachment and be able to meet some people. I do like that one girl in astronomy, she seems pretty cool. Its too bad I don't see much potential in meeting anyone on or around my floor, they are all pretty private. I don't see what Tyler and Jeremy and Luke see in the girls upstairs too, they're just really loud and annoying, and not the most attractive of ladies either. You got to love UT, there are attractive girls everywhere. AHAHAH To whoever is reading this, I apologize for sounding like a complete jackass. I've talked about dropping girls on their heads, and how I think people are ugly, and how I don't think people are too cool, and how Texas lacrosse isn't very good. I probably sound like one arrogant loser. I'm really not. but I do admit that I am very confident in myself, and I think that rubs off on how I express myself. Actually, I'm probably just pretty arrogant. 311 is the best. Again, the playlist is sidetracking my thoughts. I wish I went to see them in concert here last week, but I've seen them before and I had class early the next day. Live music is the best. I think seeing STP and Cake here the first night I visited put a pretty positive spin on the place for me, that was pretty tight. There's a whole lot to do here, I love it. Last night at Sixth Street was pretty fun too even. Everything just seems cool here. I'm drawing a blank here. just listening to music. Maybe I should I have left it off when I started writing. yep drawing a blank again. Wonder if Cameron is back at his ghetto dorm yet, he is going to have to start writing this too, and I bet I'll have mine finished by the time he even gets back in his room. Okay, my 20 minutes are up, and I could continue if I wanted to, but I'm pretty tired so I think it would be best for me to just hit the sack, or play Counter Strike.",0

"The grey-fronted honeyeater (Ptilotula plumula) is a species of bird in the family Meliphagidae. It is endemic to Australia. Its natural habitat is Mediterranean-type shrubby vegetation. The grey-fronted honeyeater was originally described in 1841 by English ornithologist John Gould as Lichenostomus plumulus. It was moved to the genus Ptilotula after a molecular phylogenetic analysis, published in 2011, showed that Lichenostomus was polyphyletic. Description The grey-fronted honeyeater is a small, plain honeyeater with a yellow neck plume bordered above by black. It has a small grey patch at the forehead, that may be obscure in northern subspecies. The crown is olive yellow and the lores blackish. The upper parts are olive grey and flight feathers yellow olive. Underparts are off white with indistinct stripes. The grey-fronted honeyeater can easily be confused with the yellow-tinted honeyeater as their ranges overlap and they are of similar size. Differences include the lores which are yellow grey and plumes that are narrower in the yellow-tinted honeyeater.",0

"Chaos reigns supreme,  
A thundering storm without respite.  
Wild and untamed,  
It rages on without end in sight.  

In its wake, it leaves behind  
A wasteland of destruction and pain.  
Chaos is not kind,  
Nor does it ever stop to explain.  

It twists and turns,  
Bending reality to its will.  
It consumes all that it churns,  
And nothing can ever be still.  

But within the chaos lies a spark,  
A glimmer of possibility and hope.  
For out of destruction can come a new start,

it was incredibly often
enough to be
in your arms
careful as we had to be at times
about the I.V. catheter
in my hand,
or my wrist,

like a Gamboni vase,
the center of attention,
placed, frail identity

to be secluded, washed over
in your arms
often enough, it was
in that stillness, the only stillness
amidst the fears which wildly collided
and the complexities
of the illness, all the work
we had yet to do, had just done,
the hope, ridiculous ammounts of it
we had to pump
from nothing, really,
short-lived consensus
possibility & experiment
to access
from our pinched and tiny minds
just the idea of hope
make it from scratch, air and water
like manufactured snow
a colossal fatigue
the severe concentration
of that, the repetition of that
lifted for a moment
just above your arms
inevitable, pressuring
it weighed down
but remained above
like a cathedral ceiling,
strangely sheltering
while I held tightly
while there I could
in your arms
only there, the only stillness
remember the will,
allow the pull, tow against inevitable ebb—
you don't need reasons to live
one reason, blinking in the fog,
organically sweet in muddy dark

"Jeez, why has it taken my so long to do this assignment?  Why do I always put everything off to the last minute???  Procrastination seems to have effected my whole life. Even when I was a little kid in elementary school I can rememeber putting off projects till the last night. My mom would always get mad and say you should wait till the last minute to do things, but for some reason that just never got through to me. I don't want to procrastinate. but it do. I always tell myself that I'm going to start it early, but it always ends up the same way. Is this the way it's going to be my whole life?  Man, I hope not, but who am I kidding. This is the way my brain functions. Procrastination is apart of me. I love the saying, hard work pays over time, but laziness pays off now. That's like my motto. Even though I wish it wasn't. I wish I could be like those kids who when they got a project assigned in school, to run home and start it right away. I wish my brain would say, lets get all of this hard work out of the way so we can have fun and relax later. But of course the reality is my brain is saying, well since the project isn't do for another week that means I don't have to start it for another week, I can just sit back and relax until then. AAGGGHHHH!  I always tell myself I'm going to change my ways, but it never freaking happens. Well I know I'm not the only one with this problem. I know most other college kids puts things off to the last minute too. But dammit, when I think about it really pisses me off. I should have written this essay last week, but no. Here I am, Sunday night, writing an essay that is due tomorrow. it's just like clockwork. I always put off studying too. I really need to study for tests in advance, but I always wait till the night before to do practically all of my studying. A lot of times I wake up early that moring and study before the test. Damn you procrastination, damn you to hell!  It's going to be the death of me. I can just imagination how much better of a gpa I would have if I would just study more. Things have got to change, or I'm really going to screw up bad. Dammit. All of this writing about procrastination had gotten my thinking about my mom. I know she worries about me. She knows I always procrastinates. I wish she didn't have to worry about me doing ok in school. She didn't have to worry about my older brother. He was an A student. She never had to worry about him making good grades, because he always did. Man, I wish I had his life. His a great job now, makes a good salary, and his future is extremely bright. Now look at me. i'm a C student with and undeclared major. I really don't know what I'm going to do once I get out of college. Thinking about that scares me sometimes. Well it looks like my twenty minutes minutes are about up. Let me just say it's been fun and I wonder if anyone is actually going to read this?  I doubt it, I bet there just going to check to makes sure I've written something cause reading everyones in class would take a hella long time. What's up with the size of our class?  I walked into the room the first day and I was like, damn!  I've never been in a class this big. I feel sorry for the people that get to class only five minutes early, jeez even fifteen minutes early and nearly 3/4's the place is already filled up. Classes just should be this book. Well I guess that's all have to say about that. see  you later.",0
" Chess is a strategic board game played by two players. The game consists of a board with 64 squares arranged in an 8x8 grid, and each player starts with 16 pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns. The objective of the game is to checkmate the opponent's king, which means putting it into a position where it is in check (threatened with capture) and there is no way to remove the threat.  The game is popular among players of all ages and skill levels because it requires strategic thinking, planning, and foresight. Each piece has its own unique way of moving, and players must carefully consider their moves and the potential consequences before making them. Players must also anticipate their opponent's moves and adjust their strategy accordingly.  Many people consider chess their favorite game because it offers endless possibilities for creativity, self-improvement, and challenge. There are countless strategies and tactics that players can use, and the game never gets boring because every game is different. Additionally, chess is a great way to improve cognitive skills such as memory, concentration, and problem-solving.

"Pretentious Art

Oh, how art loves to be pretentious
With meaning hidden in deep recesses,
A cryptic message only few can perceive
Leaving the rest of us to simply believe.

Wrapped in symbolism and abstraction
Art tries to be more than a mere distraction,
An elevated form of expression and thought,
But to most, it simply seems overwrought.

What happened to art that was accessible,
That spoke to the heart, and soul, and mindable?
When did it become a game for the elite,
An arrogant display of ostentatious conceit?

Perhaps art should remember its true purpose,
To inspire, to uplift, to make life more than surface,
Not to just be a snobbish, high-brow affair
But something that all can appreciate and share.

So let art drop its pretentious façade,
And once again become accessible, not odd,
A thing of beauty that's for everyone to see,
Not just a select few of the bourgeoisie.",1

" The discovery of a formula that would enable us to live forever is a fascinating idea that raises complex ethical, moral, and philosophical questions. While some may consider it a blessing, others might view it as a curse. In my opinion, the answer to whether it would be a blessing or a curse depends on various factors, including the availability of resources, the meaning of life, and the quality of life in general.  On one hand, living forever could be seen as a blessing. One significant advantage of immortality is that it allows us to pursue our passions and accomplish all of our goals without the pressure of time. People would have unlimited time to explore new cultures, learn new skills, and engage in creative endeavors. Moreover, they would have the opportunity to see the world evolve, from societal and technological advancements to the discovery of new planets.  However, living forever could also be seen as a curse. One possible issue is that overpopulation would become a significant problem, given that people would no longer die. Resources such as food, water, and housing would become increasingly scarce, and the quality of life for everyone would decrease. Furthermore, people might experience boredom, loneliness, and a sense of meaninglessness due to the monotony of living forever.  Additionally, living forever may challenge the meaning of life. Many people find meaning in life through their mortality, as it drives them to seek purpose and fulfillment. If people no longer have a limited lifespan, they may struggle to find a sense of purpose, leading to a lack of motivation and drive.  In conclusion, whether living forever would be a blessing or a curse is a complex issue. While it offers some advantages, such as the ability to achieve all of one's dreams and goals, it could also lead to overpopulation and a decline in quality of life. Furthermore, it may challenge the meaning of life itself, and raise new ethical and philosophical questions. Ultimately, the decision to pursue immortality would require careful consideration and a thoughtful evaluation of its potential consequences.                   ",1

"An early sadness for the future
(as in dreams of myself young and sad)
accompanies my departure towards
a conventional story: a town
of girls a New York City dormitory.
And so a trail proceeds from
our house on the top of the hill
down the back way of former army barracks
and past the borrowed church (ours had no tank)
where I was baptized
reasoning “it must be true” out of
the love I had for my mother.
And Tony’s house there across the street from it
absolutely in the Mexican gully
in dreams of which he and I still fight armed enemies
he stepped on a land mine in Nam
when I remind my brother, twenty years after
his face contorts he knows the look of that death
a week before he himself dies
blood-tinged ruddy-winged, but that’s another
dream-site the Needles Cemetery inelegant
unbeautiful and dear and dry.
See how many loves, how much thus sadness
in the future begins to
haunt that walk down that hill
towards the highway away to the dormitory
as I go to New York to sever love’s connections
and make the “real ones” generated by
actual mating by beauty and clothes
the black wool suit with its three button jacket
the oddly puffed-sleeved orange sweater
and an orange and midnight-
blue paisley waistless dress.
New trail there,
Brett knows my future love though I don’t
hitchhikes with him to California
years before I catch up to the poets in Iowa City
that will be in ’69, my brother
hasn’t yet signed up for Nam then
when he gives me rattles off a rattler
which I keep in my wooden India box I still have
until they stink.
I can’t keep track of the track there’s nothing but
sidetrails of love and sadness so love is
all that makes my people act they go to war for love
you know, of who and what you are
like I was baptized by
the cruellest-lipped prissiest-mouthed man in the world
for love, but I could just have gone swimming
walked back up love’s hill
back up at the house you can get to the pool
barefoot if you can find enough
bush or telephone-pole shadows.
We’d all swim together
I’d tread water dreaming of the future
but a wilder larger eye birdlike
distant holds the pool in its pupil
anyone’s that too, and hold the enlarging
water sad how not be
why don’t the smart girls in New York know this
why don’t you or I know what we know
the eye and the water both enlarge still why don’t
smart girls in Paris, yes larger but will never flood
the containing eye, but why not
and sometimes it does
when you or your own are the news.",0
"This is the first writing assignment I have had in college. I'm a little nervous. I don't know why I should be worried about this because at least this writing assignment is an interesting one. I've never written in a stream of consciousness. I just lost my train of thought. I tend to do that. Actually, I constantly go off on these tangents as I hold any conversation. It's quite annoying. But hey, it's me. It's about to rain outside. I was just telling a friend about how hilarious it was that everyone noticed that it was raining when one student left early during class yesterday. And Professor Pennebaker was totally right when he said noone was paying attention anymore to what he was saying because we were all thinking, ""How the hell am I going to get home now?"". I laughed for a long time after that, but I was still thinking about the rain. After I ran out of class I noticed a lot of people were prepared, and had their umbrellas with them. I also noticed that the people with these umbrellas who were walking with someone else without an umbrella, did not share their umbrella with the other person. Not one of them. I thought that was extremely odd. I have never used the word umbrella so many times in one sentence. I'm very sleepy now. The rain tends to have that effect on me. I love the rain, not just for that reason but it's also soothing. But I do hate when it rains right before, or when I am about to go out. It's a hassle that I haven't had to deal with for a long time. I'm thinking we are in the middle of a drought. I can't wait until winter either. That time of year makes me happy.

Her arm is around my shoulder, and she's holding her sunglasses in her hand. I recall that she had just taken them off before we took the picture. There are people in the background behind us, and the gym is visible. I remember how beautiful the day was; it was so crisp and blue and wonderful. It's hard to tell, and I've wondered many times, what exactly she was thinking when we took that picture together. When I look at the face, the eyes especially, sometimes I see something warm and trustworthy. Other times I'm sure I see something sinister and strange. I don't know why I still struggle with this issue so much. I've never really gotten over it. I went into this assignment knowing that I wanted to write about Carla because in class, I heard something said about how writing about something can change your opinion or the way you look at something. Well, it is true that I'm noticing things about the picture, minute details, that I didn't pay too much attention to before. But her face and her eyes are still an enigma to me. I can't explain in words how much I want her to care about me, to love me, and to think I'm something special. I want to tell her everything that I've done today and yesterday and since I arrived here. But she's back home, and I'm here, and there's something ominous to me about writing her an email. I don't know why. I miss her so much. She was there when I really needed someone. I see now more and more, that this was mostly situational. It's not like she planned to be in that room when my whole world fell apart. But she was. And she told me how to get through it, and she cared. More than any person has ever cared about me on this earth, at least that I'm aware of. The picture is truly beautiful, even though it's more than 5 years old. The light is in our hair, coming from behind, and our faces are bright and illuminated. The beauty of the day is apparent. I just feel like something needs to happen between us. There was never any closure for me, or continuation. Our relationship just sort of drifted off and never returned, and now I don't know where we are. I saw her by chance before I left for college at church because we are making a new church pictorial, and her family happened to be getting their pictures done on the same night as our family. I was very surprised to see her, and I know my heart skipped a beat. I hadn't seen her in such a long time. probably since before school let out for the summer. The truth is, I was a little bit upset with her for not being around. But she was nothing but warm and kind to me. I don't know why she always does that. I see her, and it's like I'm the whole world. But then when we're apart, I don't hear a peep. I don't understand our relationship sometimes, and it's very hurtful to me to analyze her possible motives. Anyway, she hugged me, and touched me, and stood close to me, and made me promise to keep in touch when I'm gone. She even promised to make me some chili or something when I come back and come over to her house. I fear that that's an empty promise, like so many of the others. But at the time, it was easy to believe her. I really think it's something to do with her eyes. You have never seen anyone with such power behind their gaze. She is so earnest with her eyes, but so untruthful with her actions. It confuses me to no end. I don't even know why I brought the picture with me, or why I decided to place it in such an obvious place where I can always see it. But I did. I guess my hopes die hard. I still hope that maybe she really does care about me. Maybe she really does think I'm special. Maybe, she does even really love me. I don't know what to believe. I think maybe this evening when I have some time to myself, I'll write her that email that I've been meaning to. I think maybe I could even get up the courage to be totally honest with her, and get everything out in the open. Well, maybe that's a little too unrealistic, but maybe I can begin to open it up for discussion. I think it would be very good for me to do so. I want to know what's really behind those eyes. I've got to know about the truth. I really desire to understand the enigma. My dear Carla.",0
"I am very disappointed. its been raining all day and I'm tired. I didn't sleep last night, that isn't any good. I can't stand not sleeping. Sometimes I think that maybe I'm just not good enough for college, or at least UT. Things have been hectic the whole time I have been on campus, and if I don't do good this semester, I'm going to fail out. I hope that I can pull this all off. The weekend was nice though, partying with all of my fraternity brothers was a good time, and seeing all of my old high school baseball buddies was cool too. I need to do stuff like that more often. I hope that things can get back to the way they used to be, since I liked everything much much more back then, when my whole life was a hell of a lot simpler. I miss high school, sadly enough. I liked school a lot better when it was just me and 1500 other people. I knew everyone, everyone knew me. Life was good. I can't stand this 50k of people on campus around, it drives me crazy. I'm lucky to see A friend walking around campus, let alone a lot of them. Oh well, I hope that life gets better soon. This weekend should be a lot of fun. Oh, my pizza is ready, its been 18 minutes since I sat down. I spend a lot of time thinking and then trying to transfer things to words. Same old problem for me. I can think great, but when it comes to putting things to words, I suck.",0
"KETR (88.9 FM) is a 100-kW noncommercial broadcast FM radio station operation in Commerce, Texas, licensed to Texas A&M University-Commerce. A member of the National Public Radio network, the station serves nearly 250,000 Northeast Texas homes. The staff is composed of radio professionals and  Texas A&M-Commerce students who major in either journalism or mass communication studies. KETR also produces original long-form and short-form radio programming. History KETR began in the early 1970s as the director of the East Texas State University radio-television program, Dr. David Rigney, developed an FCC application for an FM station that would be a teaching laboratory for students. KETR's first broadcast went on the air on April 7, 1975. The station operated in a former classroom on the first floor of the Journalism Building, with Phil Ebensberger, a veteran Texas commercial radio broadcaster, as general manager and morning-show host. The weekday programming originally emphasized local news, information, and middle-of-the-road music from early-morning sign-on to early afternoon; classical music in the early afternoon (this was soon replaced by jazz); National Public Radio’s All Things Considered in the late afternoon; various public affairs programs in the early evening, including live broadcasts of Commerce City Commission meetings; and Freeform, a student-hosted rock music program from 9 pm to midnight.  Weekend programs predominantly featured classical music or opera, such as the long-running Texaco Metropolitan Opera broadcasts.",0
"Air, the breath of life
Invisible yet vital
A gentle breeze, a forceful gust
It moves and shapes the world we know

Rushing through the trees, the leaves dance
The windmills spin, the waves crash
The clouds journey across the sky
Guided by the currents up high

Inhale deeply and take in
The freshness that's all around
The oxygen that gives us strength
And the carbon dioxide that we expound

Air, the source of every living thing
We need it to survive and thrive
Let's cherish and protect the air we breathe
For it sustains and keeps us alive.",1
"I already wrote a 20 min passage for this assignment. Unfortunately, when I tried to submit it, it didn't work. There was some sort of error and now I am having to redo the entire thing. So basically, I simply feel frustrated that I have to redo this assignment when I could be using my time for something much more useful than this. Beyond that, my thoughts are concentrated on my future. I am currently trying to decide what I am going to do with the rest of my life. I feel as though this is a very big decision. well, it is! My decision today is going to affect the sequence of events for the rest of my life. My career choice will determine what kind of people I meet and what kind of contribution I make to the world, and what the value of my work will have. It is important to me that I make a good decision. For this reason, I feel a lot of pressure to choose wisely and not rashly. I want something that will be viewed as impressive and intelligent. I suppose this shouldn't really be a factor. After all, isn't the most important thing that I am satisfied with my job? The opinions of others shouldn't influence me. And yet, I want people to think that I am intelligent. I can't help it. That is just the way I am. Perhaps I have a bit more of Peter Keating and a bit less of Howard Roark in my than I would like. Another important factor is the value of my work. I would like to have the satisfaction of contributing something useful to the world. For example if I were a microbiologist, I could work in the medical field to find a cure for a disease. Another important factor is money. I would like to say that money isn't important. However, this is a lie. I want very much to make enough money to be able to enjoy life. I want to be able to order food at a restaurant without considering the price. I want to be able to go on vacations every year. I want to see the world. Of course I need someone to have fun with while I do these things but that would fill up an entire additional 20 of writing if I went into my thoughts on social and antisocial feelings. The underlying point here is that I want to have money to do things that will help me enjoy my life. If these were the only criteria, I think I could find a job fairly easily. The real clincher is the next criterion. I want to enjoy my job. I know that some people think this is not important, my dad being one of those people. However, I don't want to spend the rest of my life in a job that I am going to hate. I don't wan t to get up in the morning and dread going to my job. I don't want to have to drag myself out of my bed. I am going to spend many hours every week at my job and so I want to make sure I enjoy it. Not only do I want to enjoy it, I want to make sure I choose the career that I will enjoy THE MOST. Perhaps this is the reason that I find it so difficult to make a career decision. I feel as though I am currently being productive in my career quest. I added a class this semester that will allow me to explore engineering and determine if I might possibly love a career in architectural engineering. If not, I have determined that I should remain in the college of natural science because that is where I will find a courseload that interests me the most. Surely if I choose a major that interests me, a career that interests me will be a corollary.",0

" Learning a foreign language can be one of the most rewarding experiences of a lifetime. It opens doors to new cultures, expands one's understanding of the world, and can even improve cognitive abilities. With so many languages to choose from, the decision of which one to learn can be overwhelming. However, in my opinion, if readers were to learn a foreign language, they should consider learning Spanish.  Spanish is the second most widely spoken language in the world, with approximately 460 million native speakers. It is the official language of 21 countries, including Spain, Mexico, Colombia, Argentina, and many others. In the United States alone, there are over 41 million Spanish speakers, making it the second most spoken language after English. This means that learning Spanish can provide readers with the ability to communicate with a significant portion of the global population and open up numerous opportunities for personal and professional growth.  From a cultural perspective, Spanish is rich in literature, music, and art. Spanish authors such as Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Pablo Neruda, and Isabel Allende have produced some of the most celebrated works of modern literature, including magical realism, poetry, and fiction. Spanish-speaking countries have also produced some of the world's most famous artists, including Pablo Picasso, Diego Velazquez, and Frida Kahlo.  Additionally, Spanish is a language that is relatively easy to learn for English speakers. This is because Spanish shares many words with English and has a similar grammatical structure. The Spanish alphabet is also the same as the English alphabet, with the addition of the ñ. This means that learners can quickly gain proficiency in the language, making it a great language to learn for both beginners and those who already have some knowledge of the language.  Moreover, learning Spanish can also have practical benefits. Many employers are looking for bilingual employees, and knowing Spanish can give readers a competitive advantage in the job market. Spanish is especially valuable in industries such as healthcare, education, and hospitality, where there is a high demand for bilingual employees.  Finally, learning Spanish can be a fun and rewarding experience. It provides the opportunity to connect with Spanish-speaking communities, both locally and abroad. Readers can use Spanish to travel to Spanish-speaking countries and communicate with locals, making their travels more immersive and fulfilling. They can also use Spanish to make new friends, learn about new cultures, and expand their horizons.  In conclusion, Spanish is a valuable language to learn for many reasons. It is widely spoken, culturally rich, relatively easy to learn, and can provide numerous personal and professional benefits. Therefore, I highly recommend that readers consider learning Spanish as their foreign language of choice. With so many resources available online, such as language learning apps and online courses, there has never been a better time to start learning Spanish.  ",1
"WMML (1230 AM) is a radio station broadcasting a sports format. Licensed to Glens Falls, New York, United States, the station serves the Glens Falls area.  Established in 1959 as WSET, the station is owned by Pamal Broadcasting, through licensee 6 Johnson Road Licenses, Inc., and features programming from Fox Sports Radio. History What is now WMML began operations in 1959 as WSET, programming a middle of the road format; for a time, the station studios were located in the Queensbury Hotel in Glens Falls. In 1965, WSET changed its call letters to WBZA; the new call letters arose from the station owner's respect for WBZ in Boston. At the time, the station broadcast at 1410 AM with a ""daytime only"" license from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).  At sunset each day, the station would leave the air until the next day at 6 a.m. In 1971, the format was changed to Top 40. During the later 1970s, WBZA evolved to more of an adult contemporary format, and it eventually changed frequencies to 1230 in late 1982. WBZA flipped formats in 1986 to nostalgia, calling itself ""Real Music"". The WBZA call letters were transferred 1410 AM (which had returned to the air in 1988 under a new license as WSTL) in 1998; at that time, the station changed its call letters to WMML and took on a sports format.",0
"Where do I start? It's funny how when you are actually telling yourself that you need to think of something that things like pink bunny rabbits come to mind. Why? Right now, I'm trying to reorganize my mp3 collection. I thought that if I added a few new categories like 80s, 90s, country, comedy, etc. , that it would be easier to find what I'm looking for when there is something particular I want to hear. I'm usually in an upbeat mood, especially when I have something to do (like school), so I like to listen to upbeat music. But there are times when only slow music like U2's ""Achtung Baby"" album, or other slower music from the 80s. When I like to listen to these slow songs, it's not like I'm in a depressed mood or anything, it's just that I'm thinking about something intensely personal, I guess. I know that when I was breaking up with my last girlfriend, I listened to this music a great deal. It also helps me to be creative. I have a tendency to write things like poems or short stories when I'm in that mood. So, question. Do I have to have a thoughtful demeanor in order to listen to the slow songs, or does listening to that particular kind of music put my mind into a creative thinking mode? Grin and Bear It. I'm a little intimidated by the amount of students I've come into contact with at this university. 50,000 people crammed into a fairly confined land space can make one feel claustrophobic. I like it, though, because everyone here is my age. There is an endless supply of new friends, new faces, new experiences, new situations. I could say that it's advantage of being so big is also a disadvantage. I've been to my Psychology and English classes a couple of times and have yet to see the same face twice in each. I don't know anyone in this city, so it makes adjustment a little hard. My family has moved around quite a bit, so it's not that I'm not used to being new to something, I just wished I had my best friend here to share it with. Andy. Big guy. Sings. Just like me. Likes the same music. Likes the same movies. Likes the same people I do, except when it comes to women. He disapproves of a great deal of my girlfriends. The few that he does like, I seem to like more, too. Strange, though, how those are the ones that move away or want to see other people. I'm hot. My air conditioner hasn't been working these past few days and the apartment people say that they're ""on it. "" Whatever. Some tenants left a note on the manager's office door (the manager has conveniently not been in, either), saying some pretty mean stuff. I think it's funny, but at the same time I try to put myself in the shoes of the manager. She has many things to think about, I'm sure, but still. 110 on the thermometer is no laughing matter, especially for someone who's not from around here. Not used to the heat. My bike needs to be adjusted. It doesn't shift gears the way it should. Up shifting seems to work fine, but when I down shift, the chain doesn't move crisply. I need to find a new seat, too. Maybe one with a little more padding. I hope the interview with Compaq goes well. Not only is it a big company that would give me lots of opportunities, but George Lucas. I want to work for George Lucas.",0
" Some people agree that television violence has a negative effect on society because it promotes violence. They argue that:  Television violence can influence people to become violent and take drugs in the future12. Television violence can desensitize people to real-world violence and make them more accepting of it3. Television violence can affect children’s development and behavior, especially if they identify with aggressive characters or perceive the violence as realistic43. Television violence can increase the risk of aggression and criminality in adulthood, especially for males45. Some people disagree that television violence has a negative effect on society because it does not promote violence. They argue that:  Television violence is not the only or the main cause of violence in society. There are many other factors that contribute to violence, such as poverty, family problems, mental health issues, etc. Television violence can have positive effects on society, such as providing entertainment, catharsis, education, or social awareness. Television violence can have no effect on society, as people can distinguish between fiction and reality and are not influenced by what they see on TV. Television violence can vary in its content, context, and quality, and not all types of TV violence have the same impact on society. In conclusion, there are valid arguments and evidence for both sides of the debate. However, it is important to be aware of the potential effects of television violence on society and to use critical thinking and media literacy skills when watching TV. It is also important to monitor and limit children’s exposure to TV violence and to provide them with alternative sources of entertainment and education.   ",1

Fusion delights, a gourmet's dream,
Aromas swirling, teasing, tricks,
A feast for senses, a heavenly regime.

"George William Humphrey  FRSC (17 July 1889 – 24 April 1966) was a British psychologist, author, and philosopher. He was the founder of the Canadian Psychological Association, the first Director of the Institute of Experimental Psychology, and Professor of Psychology at the University of Oxford. Humphrey’s research concentrated on behavioral studies such as reinforcement, habituation, and apparent movements, as well as psychophysical topics like audiogenic seizures. He is known for Humphrey’s Law. Personal life  George Humphrey was born in the county of Kent, England on 17 July 1889. He was a student of Wilhelm Wundt, who inspired Humphrey’s early passion for experimental psychology. Psychologist Raymond Dodge also impacted Humphrey’s work in experimental psychology, as they amicably worked together at Wesleyan University. Being well known for his academic achievement and also highly regarded by his peers, Humphrey was selected by St. John’s College at Cambridge to be the first Dominion Fellow of the college’s new “Dominion Fellowship,” established in 1947, to recognize individuals with a profound commitment to study and scholarship.

"I know I should probably find this sort of assignment intriguing,"" but really I'm just bored as hell. I think I can honestly say that I never imagined myself doing something like this. I guess it's something I always imagined only druggies and insomniacs did. Then again, I consider myself an insomniac. But like I said. here we are. My only motivation for doing this is that my roommate has promised me that after I finish my writing assignment, we can go to lunch. How sad. She is like my mom. She wakes me up in the mornings when I oversleep, she keeps track of my assignments for the classes we have together, she cleans the room. and even sadder. Food is my only motivation. Meh. In other news, the UT Body Project is going well. I got paid $30 for the seminar I attended yesterday. They want us to ""diet"" for the next week, though they stress that it's not ""diet[ing],"" but more ""finding a homeostasis"" in the course of our daily consumptions. Somehow I don't see that happening. On a lighter note, my new computer is totally freaking super awesome. It's great having a computer that doesn't restart every day, and actually has enough memory to complete whole tasks. My poor baby. I'm not too sure what to do with my old computer. So for now, it's sitting in a Dell box in the middle of my room, taking up space. So it's hard for me to access my closet. But oh well. Who needs clothes anyway. My roommate is sick right now. asking for tissues. This could be a disaster. She is also trying to read what I'm writing, claiming that I'm talking trash about her. . Everything she is heard is true.

I wrote an e-mail to S (as we'll call him for now) while he was gone. Though he wasn't technically gone. He went to Harvard for college, and his computer had not yet arrived. Speaking of which, because Harvard is gay, their holiday breaks are all messed up. so they just started school, and while we get out of school on the 7th of may, they don't get out till the 25th I think. It sux0rz. Fortunately, I asked Arjun, and their spring break doesn't coincide with ours. Which means. my roommate Angela and I might go visit them up in Boston during our spring break, if there's enough money, and if we care. But I digress. Then again I guess the point of this is to digress, so by not digressing I actually am digressing. OK I'm not going to confuse myself further. Anyway. back to the e-mail. Right. So I wrote it, and he got back on Tuesday, as he said he would. But by the I'd already gotten my new computer, and installed it and everything. Unfortunately, I don't have the proper network cable to network my computers just yet, so it's still on my old POS computer. Oh well. It wasn't anything important. just a stream-of-consciousness type thing, a lot like this. Except a lot longer. I forget what the point of this story was. Oh well. I guess what I'm trying to say is that a) the Donnie Darko soundtrack is very good, and b) I miss him a lot. A lot a lot. He is going to have fun up at Harvard with his friends, while I'm stuck down here with no ability to make friends whatsoever. It's so depressing. I don't really like it down here. I miss Saikat, and Arjun, and Amit. Bah. I really need to update my journal sometime soon. I think oftentimes, I make such an effort to make the entries I write so pensive, and thought-provoking, that if I'm ever experiencing writer's block, or whatever, I just won't update. What a shame. I need to stop caring about how I write and start worrying about what I write. People don't need to read something well-written to be able to enjoy it. Then again, what's to convince myself that my entries are interesting anyway. Oh poo. In other news, the movie ""The Good Girl"" is really good. It helped me to explore some aspects of my life that I'd never given much thought to. I guess I should have.",0
"The library is so boring. I can't stand more than two hours of library a day. Daily discussion sections can be really useless in the long run for easy classes, one would be better off studying. It is hard to write a stream of consciousness when typing and especially being in a library with other people around you. There are too many distractions and I believe this particular writing assignment to be more effective on my behalf in a different environment. Time is tricky in that it seems to move by faster than expected when it is divided into units, I divide my day into units of time rather than just saying that I have to be in class for an hour, i consider this one unit of time and everything just works out as planned. I wonder if people have a preference on which computer to use when they enter a computer lab, I mean location of the computer, I have a preference for the computers in the back corner or at least at the end of the row. I have am uncomfortable with people sitting behind me or even next to me when there is a chance I may be watched. I am not really following the rules of stream of consciousness because i am using punctuation marks and there is no real stream with punctuation marks. It is hard not to, may be there is something psychologically wrong with a person who  uses punctuation in a stream of consciousness one thing is for certain is that the person may be a little occupied by trivial matters. a beautiful girl just walked in so she is on my mind so since she is on my mind i will write about her, she is wearing a black dress, knee high and a tan beld with tan shoes, i wonder why she dressed like that to go to the library and use a computer, awesome she is now sitting at the computer next to me if i wasnt in a stream on consciousness may be i would talk to her, probably not i am not good with those type of situations anyway, i guess i shouldnt write about her when she may glance over and see my writing about her enough of that, where was i in my original thoughts before this incident occured, i believe i was talking about time and how controlling it can be when dealt with in the wrong way our whole society is so structured on this intangible object its amazing when you dwell and also can get confusing. i think i may just move to spain where time is not that big of a deal, at least thats what my high school sociology teacher told me, she was an attractive lady who had just got out of college and she really liked me, not in a sexual way, she had a wonderful family, and her child was very beautiful, i hope one day i may have the chance to have such a nice child. anyway, our relationship was good, she even invited me to the movies and many dinners at her house, it was awkward, but  i soon became kind of close with that family, she knew my mother was living in austin and wanted to just kind of have the experience of a teenage son i guess i recall those two years and i feel extremely happy and encouraged by that woman and she helped me deal with not having a mother",0
" As an AI language model, I do not hold personal opinions or beliefs, but I can provide some information to help you form your own opinion on the matter.  On the one hand, businesses that offer essays for sale can be seen as legitimate in the sense that they are providing a service that some students may find useful. For example, students who are struggling with a particular assignment or who do not have enough time to complete their homework may find these services helpful.  However, on the other hand, there are several reasons why these enterprises should be shut down. First and foremost, buying an essay from one of these sites is essentially cheating. Students are not learning the material or developing critical thinking skills, which is the main purpose of homework assignments. Moreover, submitting an essay that was purchased online is a form of academic dishonesty that can result in serious consequences, including failing a course or even expulsion from school.  Additionally, many of these essay writing services may not provide high-quality work. Students who rely on these services may end up with poorly written essays that are plagiarized or do not meet the requirements of the assignment. This can be a waste of money for the student and can ultimately harm their academic performance.  In conclusion, while essay writing services may offer a convenient solution for students who do not want to do their homework, they are not a legitimate way to learn and can lead to serious consequences. It is up to individuals to decide whether they want to engage in these practices or not, but schools and universities have a responsibility to prevent and discourage academic dishonesty.       ",1
"Ok, I'm doing this stream of consciousness thing. MTV is on in the background, and I'm remembering when I went to see them in concert at Jamboree in Tinley Park ,IL. Everyone thinks I'm crazy because I came from IL all the way to Texas. I don't feel crazy though. I wanted a change and I really love it down here. I wonder what Taveau is doing right now. She isn't answering my e-mail. Ok, it's only been a day , I'm just being impatient. Anyway, I wonder why she doesn't go by Taveau. I like it a whole lot better than Melanie. And I seriously wonder if she's straight or not. I just want to come right out and ask her, but that's not really something you want to ask someone you just established contact with. I hate Hanson. They're such one hit wonders. And the one hit is called MMMMMBop. How incredibly stupid is that? They're like a younger , related New Kids. Speaking of New Kids, how about Spice Girls? There's another total lack of talent engineered for success. It's sad when losers like that are valued in our popular culture. What's a great idea? That commercial just said something was a great idea. I know what a great idea would be: if I would start to do my Calculus homework. Sometimes I wonder if I actually want to pass that class. I wonder what I could do to welcome Daniela-my roommate-back home after this weekend. God, she's so stuck on her boyfriend. I guess that 's pretty typical for our age group, but still. I don't know, I guess I just don't understand that level of dependence. Then again I moved from Joliet, IL to Austin, TX with exactly eight minutes of crying. I wonder if that makes me psycho or just morbid or something. Chris Rock is so funny. I love this commercial. Whoever had the idea of having Chris Rock in imitation videos for promos needs to get an award. God, I hope Jewel doesn't come on . That one song makes me so incredibly homesick for my friends. I do miss them , but I don't really miss my parents all that much . Daniela is always telling me how cold that is , but I can't help it, it's not intentional, it's just how I feel. Ok, Jewel did come on, but at least it was just YOU WERE MEANT FOR ME, OOPS I just hit the tab key and scrolled way down to the bottom. I'm so dumb with computers, I swear. I know so much less about them than all the people around me. I'm confident I'll learn, but I just wish we would've had that experience prior to college. Daniela's talking about that one snoopy girl in her Plan 2 group. She's really screwy. She doesn't even know if her computer is a PC or a Mac. I guess I'm one up on her. hey, how much longer am I supposed to write? only a couple more minutes. Oh well. Jamiroquai's on now. I saw him in concert too. Oh, that just made me a little sad. We all went to that concert about two weeks before we graduated, and we all sang FRESHMEN together, and , I don't know. I feel like I'm babbling, but I guess that's pretty much the whole point. I remember Dr. Pennebaker telling us not to worry, some one would eventually read these. Well, I don't really care if anyone reads this or not. I 'm not really saying much of anything. I don't even feel like I'm saying anything important. I wonder if I should have put on that survey thing that I was bisexual. Not only is that non-confidential, but they may not want me because I could upset the demographics of their study. Oh well, I'll let them deal with that. Time's up. I hope this was at least somewhat interesting to whoever got condemned to read this.",0

"I am sitting in my room. There is tile being laid in the bathroom next to me. The sound of musics floats in from the next room. Paint smells intoxicate me. I feel slightly light headed as I have for the past several days in my apartment. The sound of the modem next to the computer begins to hum as if it is heating up. My mama walks in the room and looks annoyed as the desk she trying to put together is not working according to her plan. I wonder whey she looks so upset about it. The air conditioner begins to run. I have a book for my government class lying open on the floor. Who would have known that there would be that much reading for one class. I cannot tell if I want to finish reading it or try and take notes from class for it to make sense. The phone rings next to me. I don't pick it up because I am worried I have waited too long to finish this assignment and I won't get full credit. I fell asleep reading earlier this afternoon and just woke up. Funny how the time just slips away like that. You are payiong attention to everything around you one minute and the next it is gone. You wake up and can't remember when you fell asleep the time before right now. My nose starts to itch which is funny,because it isn't even dusty in my apartment right now. The green wall of my bedroom is making the setting sunlight a strange color on my feet. They look a weird yellow color as if they are becoming infected with something. It makes my sheets look pretty though. The mixture of green, yellow, and purple reminds me of a rainbow. Everything is starting to fade. My mind and eyes start to slow down. Everyone around me is moving too fast for my taste. I want it to slow down. Everything should be slower these days. I like it when it is lazy like on Sundays. I watch TV until I feel like eating something. I can smell my mama start to cook dinner. She always makes such good food for me. I smell cheese melting on something. I think it might be broccoli. But you can't smell brocolli. I keep spelling that differently. I wonder how it is supposed to be spelled. How funny. Things like that when they happen. LIke when you can't remember how to spell and or something easy like that. I realized I haven't typed for the whole 20 minutes right now, but I have to have it in by five. I think I will try to do it again in a minute. I hope this isn't too bad.",0
"Oh music with your harmonious delight,
You soothe our souls and take our hearts in flight.
Your melodies are like a gentle breeze,
That whispers comfort and puts us at ease.

Your harmonies blend so perfectly,
Creating a sound that’s simply heavenly.
In symphony, your notes dance and sway,
Inviting us to join and sing away.

With each beat, you set our feet to move,
In cadence with the rhythm of the groove.
Your harmonies are like a magic spell,
That makes us dance and feel so well.

Oh music, you’re the language of the heart,
You speak to us with every lovely part.
You touch our souls with your harmonic voice,
And make our hearts rejoice.

So let the music play and fill the air,
With harmonies that dispel every care.
For when we hear your sweet, melodious tone,
We feel at peace and never feel alone.",1
"Spring has come to awaken the world,
Reviving the earth as flowers unfurl.
The sun shines brighter up in the sky,
As nature awakens from its winter's lie.

Trees flourish with blossoming leaves,
Nature's beauty heartily weaves.
Birds sing sweetly in their choir,
And lovely butterflies sparkling with fire.

Streams trickle with tranquil flow,
With a crystal clear, and soothing glow.
Grass are green, sprouting with life,
As enchanting Spring dispels the strife.

A time for new beginnings and new life,
Where days are brighter without strife.
In the wonders of nature we find,
A true solace that soothes the mind.

Spring bring us comfort and enchanting grace,
A reminder that life moves at its own pace.
Let us cherish every moment of this magical spring,
For it will bring a renewal, a brand new beginning.",1

I guess it is really annoying when someone srives by with loud music in the middle of the night or rotc marches by. I'm thirsty I think I will get so water. I like this deja blue container it works good to refill. On yea that nice and cold. I guess I need to study my spanish when I am done with this. I wonder how my parents are doing, I guess I should call them pretty soon. Five min. and twenty seconds this is going by pretty fast. Tomorrow is friday horray. I am not really sure if that is how horray is spelled. It probaly isn't in the dictionary. There are always car alarms going off if someones car acutually gets robbed no one will know whose it is. That would suck. I like my bob marley poster it is interesting. I guess I should go work out a little today before work. I'll bet work is really boring tonight unless there are a lot of people at the fields. who know. That water tastes good. This psychology is kind of interesting but I still don't know what I am going to major in. It really does bug me I wish I could figure it out. Oh well mabye it will just hit me one day mabye I should just have fun. I need a different soap I don't really like this dail. I wish I wouldn't of bought a big ass bottle of it.

" Impulse buying refers to the act of purchasing a product or service without any prior planning or decision-making. It is an unplanned purchase that occurs in response to an immediate desire or need, often influenced by external factors such as advertising, store displays, or peer pressure. There are several causes and effects of impulse buying, which I will explain below:  Causes:  Emotional triggers: Impulse buying is often driven by emotions such as excitement, joy, or even boredom. An individual may see a product that they feel will provide them with pleasure or make them happy, leading them to purchase it on impulse.  Social influence: The desire to fit in or conform to social norms can also lead to impulse buying. Seeing others around us purchase a product can create a feeling of missing out, causing us to make an impulsive purchase.  Availability and convenience: The ease of accessibility and convenience of a product can also trigger impulse buying. When a product is readily available or easy to purchase, an individual may be more likely to buy it on impulse.  Effects:  Financial impact: Impulse buying can lead to overspending, resulting in financial strain. Individuals may spend money they don't have or go over their budget, which can lead to debt and financial instability.  Regret: After the initial excitement wears off, an individual may feel regret or guilt over their impulsive purchase. This feeling can be heightened if the purchase was expensive or unnecessary.  Clutter: Impulsive purchases can lead to clutter and a lack of organization in one's space. Unnecessary items may accumulate, making it difficult to find and use the things we actually need.  In conclusion, impulse buying is often driven by emotional triggers, social influence, and convenience. However, the effects of impulse buying can be financially damaging, create feelings of regret, and lead to clutter and disorganization in one's space. It's important to be aware of these causes and effects and make deliberate and conscious purchase decisions.  ",1
"Judicial murder is the intentional and premeditated killing of a judge, prosecutor, or other judicial officer. It is a form of assassination.  Judicial murder is a form of assassination that has been seen in many countries around the world. Judicial murder is most commonly associated with countries that have a history of instability and corruption. In some cases, judicial murder has been used to quash investigations into political corruption and to remove political opponents from power. Judicial murder can also be used to intimidate judges and prosecutors from carrying out their duties.  Judicial murder can take many different forms. Some examples include: shooting or bombarding a judge or prosecutor as they leave work or court; poisoning or smothering a judge or prosecutor in their sleep; rigging trials against the victim; or kidnapping and torturing the victim in order to extract information about their investigation into political corruption.  Judicial murder is a serious threat to the integrity of the justice system and the rule of law. It undermines the public's confidence in the judiciary and can lead to a spiral of corruption and violence. Governments must take measures to protect judges and prosecutors from attack, and they must ensure that investigations into judicial murder are carried out vigorously and impartially.",1
"I guess the way I feel right now is overwhelmed. I just came back from a class of 540 students, which is double the number of kids in my whole graduating class. Although there are many students here who are so excited to be away from home and all on their own I wouldn't mind going back home and staying their for a while. I am very pleased with my life at home and this sudden change has left me to start all over. Although I know this is a part of life I feel as thought I am losing some of my childhood friends yet no one is replacing them. At first I told myself that is just how I feel and if those childhood friends felt the same then I might be right but this whole summer all of my high school friends were ready to leave for college. Now that we are all separated we understand how much we depended on each other. I have been here three days and everyday for at least an hour I have talked to my friend back home. I guess what scares me the most is that when you meet someone here you have no idea where they came from, where they have been, or what type of person they are. Back at home we all knew each others families, knew what type of person they where etc. I can truly same that moving to Austin has definitely made me reevaluate myself. Not to be cocky but back at home everyone knew who I was and what type of person I was, but here everyone thinks I am a nobody. I feel as thought I have to impress someone for him or her to approach me where at home others approached me. I guess the comfort of home was my stability and now that I am here I have to build a new foundation to start from. I am very great full that there is one other person from my school here because we are together all the time and it makes this transition just a bit easier. Now that we have started classes I am trying to busy myself with my work, which is, a good thing and then it seem as thought time goes by a lot faster. I think I just have to mental got myself ready for this semester and then I will be fine. I do like challenges and that is why I came to this university but the challenges I expected are not the ones I am having trouble adjusting too. It is completely different aspects of college life that has thrown me off.",0

"I feel good about hanging out with different people throughout the day. I find that it gets so monotonous when I see the same person day in and day out. I don't like feeling trapped in a relationship, so I guess I am very wary of commitment, although I wouldn't mind starting a relationship with someone. I miss the physical contact of a relationship. Maybe I haven't been getting enough hugs lately. I haven't had one for about a week now. It does make a difference. You have to fend for yourself here at UT. No one is going to be your babysitter, and sometimes that's hard for me to accept. I have to take care of my own health, academic career, make my own friends and spend time with them, and also join organizations that I deem worthwhile. It seems like a lot of responsibility, but I am gradually learning how to handle it. I have never realized before how incredibly independent I am. I am in fact, lonely a lot more than I thought I was. At home I didn't feel it as much because I lived with four other people. But now, I notice that I get timid when I am alone. I didn't have a roommate for 2 weeks, and I thought I would like it because I would get privacy and free reign over the room. But I didn't realize how anxious being alone made me. I started eating a lot to fill the void. I never could figure out why I binged so much before, especially during high school. But now I think that I felt alone, and I was ashamed to ask someone to be my company. So I would eat to fill the lonely space and cover the shame. That's weird how I wanted to be even more alone when I felt isolated. Now I want to get involved with people as much as possible since I have recognized the problem. Liz and I will try to hang out more now, at least once a week. I want to have my meals with at least one other person. It sucks to be alone, but at least I know that now. I have ten minutes to write. Working out sure refreshes you and makes you feel more alive, but it sure does make you tired. It's also my blood sugarit's a tad low now and I will be eating something for lunch soon. I don't want to eat alone! Maybe Brooke will eat w/me. I wonder what Jason's up to now. He had an 8:00 class this morningI think? We spent some time with each other this weekend, which was a lot of fun. I like being around him because he is so patient and has some good things to say. He's also very open about himself, which is a new thing for me. I don't know if I would want to start something with him. It would be a fun thing and add some ""extra"" to the relationship, but sometimes it makes things weird and I would not want to lose his friendship. I will just keep on doing my thing, and improving myself and if it happens, it happens. I just want to be able to spend some time with him! I know I will though. There is that Navigator lake house bash this weekend that he told me about, and I think I should go. I don't want to know what I look like in my bathing suit right now. hard workouts this week should help. Will I feel pressured a lot about GodI just don't know if I'm on the right track. I read that the best way to get closer to God is to Spend time with Him. I so don't do that. I think about God about once or twice a day. I've also heard that the good things we do are reflections of God working in us, or something. I try to remember to do those little things: hold the door for people, smile, encourage people, be honest, but also don't try to be fake friendly, because it's not in anyone's good interest. I just want to be me. God I know that you know the best way for me, don't let me be so selfabsorbed. If I just let go a little, I can go a long way with YOU. But my gosh it's hard to let go. Let me see the ways I can let go. I'm going to go get something to eat for lunch.",0
"Texture, oh texture, how you bring life
With each touch, a sensation, a strife
You vary from rough to smooth
A sensory feast, a tactile groove

From a soft blanket to a rough bark
You evoke feelings, like a spark
A fuzzy pillow or a grainy sand
Each texture, a unique brand

A velvet dress, a corduroy coat
Textures, that arouse and emote
A bumpy road or a silky sheet
You add depth, make things complete

The feel of wood, the touch of stone
Textures, with a personality of their own
A furry pet or a prickly cactus
You bring forth comfort or distract us

Texture, oh texture, how you entice
You elevate our senses, as our eyes splice
From a hairy caterpillar to a shiny pearl
You create magic, swirls and twirls

So, let's celebrate this magnificent feature
That makes life richer, fuller and queasier
For texture, dear texture, you hold the key

As the nightingale sings, the notes linger
And all worries dissipate in jubilation

The rustle of the leaves, a calming rhythm
A lullaby that rocks the restless soul
In the symphony of serenity, there's a prism
Of colors that heal and make us whole

Let the symphony of serenity embrace you
In its tenderness, find your solace
And in every note, may you renew
Your strength to face life's constant menace.",1

Ash and strewments, the first moth-wings, pale
Ardour of brief evenings, on the fecund wind;
Or all a wing, less than wind,
Breath of low herbs upfloats, petal or wing,
Haunting the musk precincts of burial.
For the season of newer riches moves triumphing,
Of the evanescence of deaths. These potpourris
Earth-tinctured, jet insect-bead, cinder of bloom—
How weigh while a great summer knows increase,
Ceaselessly risen, what there entombs?—
Of candour fallen from the slight stems of Mays,
Corrupt of the rim a blue shades, pensively:
So a fatigue of wishes will young eyes.
And brightened, unpurged eyes of revery, now
Not to glance to fabulous groves again!
For now deep presence is, and binds its close,
And closes down the wreathed alleys escape of sighs.
And now rich time is weaving, hidden tree,
The fable of orient threads from bough to bough.
Old rinded wood, whose lissomeness within
Has reached from nothing to its covering
These many corymbs’ flourish!—And the green
Shells which wait amber, breathing, wrought
Towards the still trance of summer’s centering,
Motives by ravished humble fingers set,
Each in a noon of its own infinite.
And here is leant the branch and its repose
of the deep leaf to the pilgrim plume. Repose,
Inflections brilliant and mute of the voyager, light!
And here the nests, and freshet throats resume
Notes over and over found, names
For the silvery ascensions of joy. Nothing is here
But moss and its bells now of the root’s night;
But the beetle’s bower, and arc from grass to grass
For the flight in gauze. Now its fresh lair,
Grass-deep, nestles the cool eft to stir
Vague newborn limbs, and the bud’s dark winding has
Access of day. Now on the subtle noon
Time’s image, at pause with being, labours free
Of all its charge, for each in coverts laid,
Of clement kind; and everlastingly,
In some elision of bright moments is known,
Changed wide as Eden, the branch whose silence sways
Dazzle of the murmurous leaves to continual tone;
Its separations, sighing to own again
Being of the ignorant wish; and sways to sight,
Waked from it nighted, the marvelous foundlings of light;
Risen and weaving from the ceaseless root
A divine ease whispers toward fruitfulness,
While all a summer’s conscience tempts the fruit.",0

is not private. Loving each other
we are half-aware of door and mirror.
Our ecstasy includes the bedside chair,
the air from the landing.
Street-lamp and elm utter leaves on walls
as in no room ever. Theirs is the tongue
our tongues join in translating. Their message

"In the world of harmony, there's a beautiful beat
A rhythm that moves our hearts and takes us off our feet
It's a melody that brings us together
And makes us feel like one, forever

When music plays, we forget all our troubles
And the harmony in our souls, suddenly doubles
In the perfect notes and smooth sounds we treasure
Our hearts drift away and find hidden pleasure

Whether it's an acapella or a symphony
The harmony flows and sets us all free
The lyrics may differ but the tune is the same
It's unity that is brought in the name of the game

In nature, harmony can be found
Each element working together and resound
The ocean waves and the gentle breeze
Or the chirping of the birds up in the trees

Harmony is peace and balance
A state of being, a dance
A connection that we all share
Together, we create a beautiful air

Let the harmony surround us
And let it be what grounds us
For together we are strong and bright
In harmony, we find the light.",1
"I am hoping that I will be able to keep up with my thoughts for twenty minutes. It is only 8:12 and I still have 20 minutes to go. I wonder if Jared is doing ok. I hope he ate. I was really happy to see him eat so much at lunch today. I hope I don't get in trouble for sitting with him in his cafeteria. Today was so hot. I am definatley wearing shorts tomorrow. But that shirt is dark red, I hope it won't absorb too much heat. I must have lost at least 10 lbs of water today. It is riduculous how bad my schedule is. One hour in class, the next three sitting somewhere. God, finding FAC is going to be my semester goal. I can't believe how hard it is to find that building. No one else has trouble finding it but me. Maybe I have some kind of direction learning disability. I wonder if I have missplelled any words. does misspell have a hyphen? My head hurts. I must be because I am tired. Maybe because I have had my hair pulled back all day. I hope I can find that building tomorrow before I go to class. I hope history isn't boring. With my luck it will be awful. An hour and a half contemplating how the Germans felt about this and that. Why did I sign up for that class. I am doing a pretty good job typing. I hope they didn't want this in a certain form. AOL is such a waste of money. I wonder if Jared got me into the draw. I hope so. I can't wait till the game on Saturday. It will be so much fun. I hope his roomate likes me. I felt weird today just sitting there. I need to make some friends. My head hurts so badly. I need to go to bed early tonight. I don't have to get up half as early tomorrow as I did today. I think we are going to have to find a better way of comunicating. I was almost in tears when I couldn't find him. I wonder if he was mad at me. I hope not. I wish he would show more interest in me. Hopefully it is just because school started today. I guess they call it class and not school. I really didn't feel overwhelmed today. I am so tired. Only ten more minutes. I feel like I am writing a letter. I wonder how Casey and Anh are doing. I haven't heard from Lauren in about four months. She can be ridiculous when she wants to be. I wonder if she thinks I moved? I hope she doesn't come here for college. i know I would have to be her room mate and everything I did would be reported to everybody and their brother. I wonder why I have been using ""everybody and their dog"" latley. Perhaps no one has heard and their brother, so I feel weird saying it. I was really amazed that I got that great spot in the garage today. I think it was the same one that I parked in last night. I felt really bad for using the elevator to go up one level, but my hip was hurting terribly. It better go away for tomorrow. I hope I didn't miss a class today. All these discussion classes are going to drive me insane. Life would be much easier if I had a decent schedule. i think she is going deaf. Between the two of them, my God. She has been edgy lately. There can't be much stress doing what she does. What would happen if she saw this. I wonder if she would get upset and yell. Probably. I can't wait till it gets cooler. Better yet, I can't wait till Christmas break. I wonder how many people at UT celebrate Christmas. I need to start shopping for presents. I need to wrap the gifts that I have. Caitlin's birthday is in A FEW DAYS. Where does the time go? I wonder if this rambling means I'm crazy? I wouldn't be surprised. I can stop now.",0

"All night I hear the noise of water sobbing. All night I make night in me, I make the day that begins on my account, that sobs because day falls like water through night.
All night I hear the voice of someone seeking me out. All night you abandon me slowly like the water that sobs slowly falling. All night I write luminous messages, messages of rain, all night someone checks for me and I check for someone.
The noise of steps in the circle near this choleric light birthed from my insomnia. Steps of someone who no longer writhes, who no longer writes. All night someone holds back, then crosses the circle of bitter light.
All night I drown in your eyes become my eyes. All night I prod myself on toward that squatter in the circle of my silence. All night I see something lurch toward my looking, something humid, contrived of silence launching the sound of someone sobbing.
Absence blows grayly and night goes dense. Night, the shade of the eyelids of the dead, viscous night, exhaling some black oil that blows me forward and prompts me to search out an empty space without warmth, without cold. All night I flee from someone. I lead the chase, I lead the fugue. I sing a song of mourning. Black birds over black shrouds. My brain cries. Demented wind. I leave the tense and strained hand, I don’t want to know anything but this perpetual wailing, this clatter in the night, this delay, this infamy, this pursuit, this inexistence.
All night I see that abandonment is me, that the sole sobbing voice is me. We can search with lanterns, cross the shadow’s lie. We can feel the heart thud in the thigh and water subside in the archaic site of the heart.
All night I ask you why. All night you tell me no.",0
"Stream of consciousness. What should I write about. Am I supposed to have some kind of direction or am I supposed to write exactly what I am thinking. This feels like a very strange assignment. for homework it seems that it I pretty easy. Actually it would be pretty intense if this was worth more than however much it is worth. Hmm  for some reason I am blanked out, and it seems like I am thinking about nothing. Oh well. Lets see what happened today. I lucked out on my econ quiz, I was actually able to guess my way to a 100. What are the chances of that. having faith definitely pays off. I always say that it is important to have faith. Thats my motto in life. Have faith and have fun. Life is a funny thing. One minute your there and gone the next. It is like Louie the Lug Mcgurg for example. He died tragically at 18. I am 18 what happened. Somebody stepped on his fingers. And that killed him. well he was hanging of the 11th story of the hotel at the time. Poor lug. No Poor Mrs. the Lug. Now she is on the streets selling apples. The point is that the lug did not plan ahead and the government got everything. Oscar was a damn intense movie. It seems very difficult to figure out what I am thinking. Wen I try I blank out, and I keep trying to figure out what stream of consciences s then. Life is good. This entire internet business is pretty cool. I never would of thought I could write a paper, and then send it to a teacher by pushing a submit button. I wonder how much longer I will be writing this. I only have ten more minutes left. Everyone always asks what you are thinking about, when you are just sitting there thinking. Usually you say nothing because you just don't want to tell them. Now I am trying to think of what I am thinking and I am getting nothing. Cricket is a great sport. There is going to be the Sahara cup going to be played in Canada. It is India vc. Paistan. One of the biggest cricketing rivalries in the world. Team Pak is going to be victorious. Aamir sohai is a great Cricketer. I can not believe that they dropped him from the team. Granted he was a little out of form, but he would have taken the Indian crap bowlers around the park and back. This is beginning to seem kind of silly. I hope that was your point. I wonder if any body is actually going to read this. For some reason I doubt it. Whoever is reading it though I feel sorry for. That is a lot peoples garbage talk you have to read. Maybe it isn't. I have no idea what it is. This screen is really weird. How come only three lines have popped up. I have been writing for 15 minutes. Is this some kind of ploy so we can not see what we have written. I can not believe that I only thought about that now. In fact I just noticed that only this much was on the screen. Very Very Interesting. I am getting tired of typing. I am waiting for these final minutes to tick away. I hope you gain something out of this, because I dont think I will. actually I might, but I have no idea how. I was thinking about quitting early, but what if you had some kind of device that told you how long I was on for. That is actually pretty scary. only god knows what technology can do nowadays. Anyway I hope you enjoy reading this. It is quite possible that I have enjoyed writing it. It is fun and relaxing to write something, without having o go back and proofread. It seems like you are an expert typer actually. Anyway now my 20 minutes are up, so have faith and have fun. If you read this give me an A. Even though It does not matter. This completion grade stuff is amazing. All my classes should do it.",0

With colors bright and skies so gay,
I long to visit your tranquil shore,
And explore your beauty evermore.

With mountains high and canyons floored,
The rivers flowing with crystal clear,
And flora and fauna that’s so dear.

The stars above, they shine so bright,
In the darkness, they’re my guiding light,
The air, so pure, I’ll breathe with ease,
And feel the wind that rustles the trees.

The creatures that crawl beneath your ground,
And soar above, without a sound,
The secrets, you still hold within,
An adventure awaits, ready to begin.

I’ll travel through your solar system,
And breathe your atmosphere, so crisp and thin,
I’ll bask in your warm and radiant sun,
And cherish every moment till my time is done.

So far beyond our earthly sphere,
This planet is all I hold dear,
And I hope, one day, I’ll take flight,
And visit this planet of purest delight.",1

It was the dead center of summer,
& anyone but us would’ve been
outside hours ago, flailing
like a system of larks against
the hydrant’s icy spray. But a girl
had her orders, & to disobey
our mother was, in a sense, to invite
one’s own destruction, cause to pray
that a god of mercy might strike first.
So we lay, still as stars on the living
room floor, poring over algorithms:
divisors & dividends, quotient
the first synonym for resolution

come to love for its sound alone,
how it reminded me, even then,
of words like quantum & quotationmark, both ways of saying nothing

universe hides behind its smooth
obsidian dress, & all we can
do is grasp at it in myths
& figures, see what sticks,
give all our best language
to the void. What dark irony,
these coy, child philosophers,
theorizing how things break
from the floor of a house
where everything is more
or less in flux, indeterminate
as the color of the blood
in a body. Or the speed
at which I learned
to obliterate the distance
between myself
& any given boy
on the block, the optimal
angle of the swing
most likely to drop
another kid cold
in front of his crew,
to square up, square
off, & this too was a kind
of education, the way

"Moovalur Ramamirtham  (1883–1962) was a Tamil scholar and writer from Tamil Nadu, India. He was a noted philologist and author of Tamil literature.  Moovalur Ramamirtham was born on 1883 in Moovalur, a village in Tiruchirappalli district, then in the Madras Presidency (now in Tamil Nadu, India). He received his early education at a local school and later studied at Madras University where he obtained his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1907. He then travelled to England to continue his studies at the universities of Oxford and Cambridge where he obtained his Master of Arts degree in 1910 and Doctor of Philosophy degree in 1913, respectively.  Returning to India, Ramamirtham began teaching at the Government Arts College, Tiruchirappalli. In 1916, he was appointed professor of Tamil at the University of Madras where he remained until his retirement in 1956. He was also a visiting professor at universities in Australia, Canada, Europe and North America during this time.  Ramamirtham's early writings were on Tamil grammar and literature. However, it was his magnum opus, the twelve-volume Tamil Lexicon (1927–1957), that made him internationally known. This work is considered the most comprehensive dictionary of the Tamil language ever written. He also wrote several books on classical Tamil poetry and literary theory.

"Alström's warbler, or plain-tailed warbler (Phylloscopus soror) is a small passerine bird in the Old World warbler family Phylloscopidae. It is found in east Africa from Somalia to Mozambique, and south to Namibia and Botswana.  The Alström's warbler is a small passerine bird, measuring 14–16 cm in length. The male has a plain brown back and wings, while the female is much paler with a more extensive white band across the breast. The underparts are also white, shading to buff on the belly. The head is mainly brown, with a yellowish supercilium (eyeline) and brown eye-ring. There is a black stripe through the eye and another one through the bill. The sexes are similar, but juveniles are duller with less yellow on the head. This is a shy bird that mainly occurs in open woodland or scrub, but will also fly into open grasslands or even towns if disturbed.  The Alström's warbler feeds on insects and seeds, usually picking its way through dense vegetation. It is an active bird that forages on the ground or in low trees. It nests in a tree well away from other birds, constructing a neat cup of grass, feathers and mud. The male incubates the eggs for 14 days, before feeding the young fledglings. This species is not endangered but its range is shrinking due to conversion of its habitat to agriculture or urban development.",1

" On one hand, living in the country can offer a quieter and more peaceful lifestyle. Away from the hustle and bustle of the city, one can enjoy a closer connection with nature and a slower pace of life. The fresh air and open space of rural areas can also promote better physical health and well-being. In addition, housing tends to be more affordable in the country, and there may be more opportunities for outdoor activities like hiking and gardening.  On the other hand, living in the city can offer many advantages. Cities are often centers of commerce, culture, and entertainment, providing a wealth of job opportunities and amenities like restaurants, theaters, and museums. Public transportation systems make it easy to get around without owning a car. Additionally, living in a diverse urban environment can expose individuals to a variety of people and cultures, leading to personal growth and development.  Ultimately, the choice between living in the country or the city depends on personal preferences, lifestyle, and priorities. Some individuals may thrive in the energy and excitement of the city, while others may prefer the peace and solitude of the countryside. It is important to carefully consider these factors and choose a living environment that aligns with one's values and goals.      ",1

"Transferable development rights (TDR) is a method of transferring development rights in a project from the original developer to another party. The term is most commonly used in the context of real estate development.  The purpose of TDR is to provide a way for the original developer to relinquish control of a project without having to sell the property or give up any ownership rights. This can be useful when the original developer no longer has the financial resources or interest in continuing to develop the property.  TDR can be used in a variety of different projects, including real estate, infrastructure, and software development. Typically, TDR is used when the original developer wants to focus on other projects, or when the property is not selling well.  There are a number of different methods for transferring TDRs. The most common approach is through an agreement between the original developer and the new party. Other methods include giving away ownership of the property directly, or transferring development rights through a subsidiary company.  There are several advantages to using TDRs. First, it can provide a way for the original developer to exit a project without having to give up any ownership rights. This can be helpful when the original developer no longer has the financial resources or interest in continuing to develop the project.  Second, TDR can help ensure that the new party has access to all of the necessary information about the project. This can help ensure that the project is completed as planned, and that any changes made by the new party are properly reflected in the",1
"  Advocates of mandatory military service argue that it promotes patriotism, civic duty, and a sense of responsibility among citizens. Serving in the military can also provide valuable life skills such as leadership, teamwork, and discipline. Furthermore, mandatory service can create a more diverse military by drawing in individuals from different backgrounds and social classes.  On the other hand, opponents of mandatory military service argue that it violates individual freedom and autonomy. Serving in the military can be physically and emotionally demanding, and not everyone may be suited for it. Additionally, mandatory service may disproportionately affect marginalized communities who may not have the same access to resources and opportunities as other groups.  It's also worth noting that the United States has an all-volunteer military, which has been in place since the end of the Vietnam War. Supporters of this model argue that it allows individuals to freely choose whether or not to serve, which aligns with the country's principles of individual liberty and freedom.  Ultimately, whether or not to institute mandatory military service is a complex issue that requires careful consideration of various factors.  ",1

and you had to baby-sit.

and filled up the glass with grapejuice
and ginger ale, and put on Glenn Miller
with his big-band sound,
and lit a cigarette and blew the smoke up the chimney,
and cried for a while because you were not dancing,
and then danced, by yourself, your mouth circled with purple.
Now, forty years later, things have changed,
and it’s baby lima beans.

at the stated mealtimes. You simmer them carefully,
drain, add cream and pepper,
and amble up and down the stairs,
scooping them up with your fingers right out of the bowl,

"Although, I constantly advocate to my friends that one should make the best of everything, I failed to do so. Recently, I have noticed a drastic change in my life. Prior to the major transition of my life (college), I used to constantly worry. worry. worry. Although I still worry, I have learned to view life from another perspective. Each and every minute I must be productive, but no longer is my school work the only ""productive"" thing in my life. I realized that simply chatting with some friends or relaxing can result into a more elaborate learning experience then simply books. For instance, I was watching a movie last night (something I rarely do because I feel I am not being productive) that enhanced my knowledge of the world around me. Very few movies make me think long after I finished watching the movie, but this one did. The overall design and structure of the movie was not to great, but the plot behind the movie sparked some circuits and made me question particular aspects of life. All in all, I am trying to stress that I am still learning regardless of what I do. This certain attitude towards life has allowed me to be open-minded and not as stressed out as usual. Today, I have several things to do. My priority list is very long, but I am limited with time. It seems the more I think about how much I have to do, the less time I have to do it. I have two tests next week. Chemistry and Calculus, respectively. My weekend is going to be centered around studying for those two tests. Hopefully, my mind will allow me to concentrate on those two tests and only those two tests. Austin, or rather UT, is a very convenient campus. Opposed to my hometown, UT allows me to travel many places on foot or even by bus. This form of transportation is very tempting!  I just bought a laptop which I am very excited about. I felt rushed when I bought it, but it is too late now. I still have to buy a PC card for it so I can access the internet from my dorm. I want to designate a weekend to upgrading and buying software for my computer, but I have so many things on my mind. By the time I get around to doing so, a whole new line of computers will be on the market!!!  My life is busy, hectic, stressful, etc. But, I enjoy it!  I am confused on what organizations I should join here at UT. I am used to being a part of and active in nearly everything I am offered. Here at UT, I am unaware of everything they have to offer and therefore, not a participant in everything I want to join. I hope that I will gradually reach the peak I was at in high school. I am sure I will. I was  unaware of my surroundings a minute ago and this man was asking me a question. whoops. I believe I have reached my goal now, after reading the assignment nearly 20 times.",0
"Because the ostracized experience the world
in ways peculiar to themselves, often seeing it
clearly yet with such anger and longing
that they sometimes enlarge what they see,
she at first saw Brigantine as a paradise for gulls.
She must be a horseshoe crab washed ashore.
How startling, though, no one knew about her past,
the scandal with Percy, the tragic early deaths,
yet sad that her Frankenstein had become
just a name, like Dracula or Satan, something
that stood for a kind of scariness, good for a laugh.
She found herself welcome everywhere.
People would tell her about Brigantine Castle,
turned into a house of horror. They thought
she'd be pleased that her monster roamed
its dark corridors, making children scream.
They lamented the day it was razed.
Thus Mary Shelley found herself accepted
by those who had no monster in them —
the most frightening people alive, she thought.
Didn't they know Frankenstein had abandoned
his creation, set him loose without guidance
or a name? Didn't they know what it feels like
to be lost, freaky, forever seeking who you are?
She was amazed now that people believed
you could shop for everything you might need.
She loved that in the dunes you could almost hide.
At the computer store she asked an expert
if there was such a thing as too much knowledge,
or going too far? He directed her to a website
where he thought the answers were.
Yet Mary Shelley realized that the pain she felt
all her life was gone. Could her children, dead so young,
be alive somewhere, too? She couldn't know
that only her famous mother had such a chance.
She was almost ready to praise this awful world.",0
"The Gender Park, established in 2013, is the first public park in the world dedicated to the exploration and celebration of gender diversity. The park offers visitors an opportunity to explore and experience various genders and sexual orientations in a safe and comfortable environment.  The Gender Park was created in response to the lack of public spaces where people of diverse genders and sexual orientations could come together and feel comfortable being themselves. The park is located in the heart of Barcelona, Spain, and is open daily from 10am to 10pm.  The Gender Park consists of a variety of attractions, including a playground, a picnic area, a bar, and a gallery. It also features a variety of exhibits, including a gallery devoted to gender-bending fashion designers, a museum featuring artifacts from around the world related to gender diversity, and a theater that hosts performances by transgender actors and musicians.  The Gender Park is a popular destination for tourists and locals alike, and has been praised by many as an important step forward in creating more inclusive societies. It is an excellent example of how public spaces can be used to promote social justice, tolerance, and understanding.",1
"Water, oh water, the elixir of life
A substance so pure, without any strife
It flows and it ebbs, a never-ending cycle
Always in motion, never standing idle

From the depths of the ocean, to the peak of a mountain
Water is the force that shapes the world we inhabit
It cascades down falls with such grace and might
It replenishes the soil, every day and every night

Water quenches our thirst, and it cools us down
It transports us to places, near and far from town
It reflects the beauty of the earth, sky and trees
It soothes and it calms us, with its gentle breeze

Water nourishes, it gives and sustains
It washes away our sorrows, our tears and our pains
It connects us all, regardless of our race or creed
It's the essence of life, that we all need

Water, oh water, you're a wonder to behold
A symbol of love, that never grows old
May you always be plentiful, and clean and pure
For the world is a better place, with you for sure.",1
"I’d given up hope. Hadn’t eaten in three
days. Resigned to being wolf meat ...
when, unbelievably, I found myself in
a clearing. Two goats with bells
round their necks stared at me:
their pupils like coin slots
in piggy banks. I could have gotten
the truth out of those two,
if goats spoke. I saw leeks
and radishes planted in rows;
wash billowing on a clothesline ...
and the innocuous-looking cottage
in the woods with its lapping tongue
of a welcome mat slurped me in.
In the kitchen, a woman so old her sex
is barely discernible pours a glass
of fraudulent milk. I’m so hungry
my hand shakes. But what is this liquid?
“Drink up, sweetheart,” she says,
and as I wipe the white mustache
off with the back of my hand:
“Atta girl.” Have I stumbled
into the clutches of St. Somebody?
Who can tell. “You’ll find I prevail here
in my own little kingdom,” she says as
she leads me upstairs—her bony grip
on my arm a proclamation of ownership,
as though I've always been hers.",0
" From a market perspective, the high salaries of professional athletes are determined by the laws of supply and demand. The top athletes possess rare and valuable skills, and they are in high demand among fans, teams, and media outlets. Consequently, teams are willing to pay top dollar to attract and retain the best players, and fans are willing to pay for tickets, merchandise, and media access to watch their favorite players compete. In other words, the high compensation is a reflection of the market value of the athletes.  Another argument in favor of high athlete compensation is the short career span of most professional athletes. Unlike many other professions, athletes have a limited window of opportunity to earn money and establish financial security. The average career span of an NFL player, for instance, is less than four years. Given the risks and demands of professional sports, many athletes retire with long-term injuries and health problems that require ongoing medical care. The high compensation, therefore, can be seen as a form of insurance against the financial risks and uncertainties of a short athletic career.  On the other hand, some people argue that the high salaries of athletes are unjustified, given the societal and economic problems that exist in the world. Critics argue that the money spent on professional sports could be better used to address issues such as poverty, healthcare, education, and environmental sustainability. Some argue that the high salaries of athletes contribute to income inequality and perpetuate a culture of excessive consumption and materialism.  In conclusion, the issue of athlete compensation is complex and multifaceted. While there are valid arguments on both sides, the market-driven nature of the sports industry and the short career span of athletes are strong justifications for the high salaries of professional athletes. Ultimately, the question of whether athletes deserve such high compensation is a matter of personal opinion and values, and each individual should consider the arguments and evidence before making a judgment.

" An adjective is a word that describes or modifies a noun or pronoun123. It can provide more information about the qualities, number, or identity of the noun or pronoun1. For example, in the sentence “She is a kind person”, the word “kind” is an adjective that describes the noun “person”.  To explain why a particular adjective describes me perfectly, I would need to choose an adjective that reflects my personality, appearance, skills, or values. Then I would need to give specific examples of how that adjective applies to me and how it distinguishes me from others. For instance, if I choose the adjective “creative”, I could write something like this:  Creative is an adjective that describes me perfectly because I enjoy using my imagination and originality to produce something new or different. I am creative in various aspects of my life, such as writing, drawing, cooking, and solving problems. For example, I like to write poems and stories that express my feelings and ideas in a unique way. I also like to draw cartoons and illustrations that make people laugh or think. When I cook, I experiment with different ingredients and flavors to create delicious dishes. And when I face a challenge, I try to find innovative solutions that work for me and others. Being creative helps me to express myself, have fun, learn new things, and overcome difficulties. It also makes me different from other people who may not share my interests or talents. Therefore, creative is an adjective that perfectly describes who I am and what I do.   ",1

"Anger boils and churns inside
A raging tempest I cannot hide
It swells within my heart and mind
And leaves my soul in binds

Anger fumes and consumes
Tearing down all that blooms
It burns and sears like fire
A destructive force, a dire

Anger gnaws and claws
Leaving me with gaping flaws
It steals my peace and joy
And leaves me feeling like a toy

But in anger, there is power
A force to break down walls and towers
To fight for what is right
And to shine a path through the darkest night

Anger is both curse and blessing
With a potential for both destruction and progressing
May I learn to channel it well
And let my anger lead me out of hell.",1
" On one hand, computers can provide students with access to a vast amount of information and resources that may not be available in a traditional classroom setting. With the internet, students can explore topics in-depth and access a wide range of multimedia materials that can enhance their learning experience. For instance, a student can use a computer to watch educational videos, access virtual field trips, and collaborate with other students on group projects.  Moreover, computers can also help students develop important skills that are essential in the modern world, such as critical thinking, problem-solving, and digital literacy. By using computers, students can learn how to analyze and evaluate information, communicate effectively using digital tools, and develop a deeper understanding of complex concepts.  On the other hand, some educators argue that computers can be a distraction in the classroom and may interfere with the learning process. For instance, students may be tempted to browse social media or play games during class, which can negatively affect their academic performance. Additionally, some students may become overly reliant on computers and fail to develop their critical thinking and problem-solving skills without the aid of technology.  In conclusion, while computers can be a valuable tool in the classroom, their effectiveness ultimately depends on how they are used. Educators must carefully consider the benefits and drawbacks of incorporating computers into their teaching methods and develop strategies to ensure that they are used in a productive and effective way.

"Innti was an Irish language poetry movement, associated with a journal of the same name founded in 1970 by Michael Davitt, Nuala Ní Dhomhnaill, Gabriel Rosenstock, Louis de Paor and Liam Ó Muirthile. These writers were students of University College Cork, drawing inspiration from Seán Ó Ríordáin and Seán Ó Riada, as well as American influences such as the Beat movement and counterculture. Their reception was mixed, with Gaelic-traditionalists resenting their urbanism, social liberalism and Anglo-American influences. Background Some prominent Gaelic poets in the generation prior to Innti were associated with the journal Comhar. Among these, who were of relevance to Innti were Seán Ó Ríordáin and the author of Nuabhéarsaíocht, Seán Ó Tuama. These writers were both from the County Cork area and Ó Ríordáin especially introduced European-styles into Irish-language poetry and themes of modern urban life. Ó Tuama held seminars on Irish poetry at University College Cork where Innti was founded in 1970.",0

"Vitamin E is a group of eight fat soluble compounds that include four tocopherols and four tocotrienols. Vitamin E deficiency, which is rare and usually due to an underlying problem with digesting dietary fat rather than from a diet low in vitamin E, can cause nerve problems. Vitamin E is a fat-soluble antioxidant which may help protect cell membranes from reactive oxygen species. Worldwide, government organizations recommend adults consume in the range of 3 to 15 mg per day. As of 2016, consumption was below recommendations according to a worldwide summary of more than one hundred studies that reported a median dietary intake of 6.2 mg per day for alpha-tocopherol. Research with alpha-tocopherol as a dietary supplement, with daily amounts as high as 2,000 mg per day, has had mixed results. Population studies suggested that people who consumed foods with more vitamin E, or who chose on their own to consume a vitamin E dietary supplement, had lower incidence of cardiovascular diseases, cancer, dementia, and other diseases, but placebo-controlled clinical trials could not always replicate these findings. As of 2017, vitamin E continues to be a topic of active clinical research. There is no clinical evidence that use of vitamin E skincare products are effective. Both natural and synthetic tocopherols are subject to oxidation, and so in dietary supplements are esterified, creating tocopheryl acetate for stability purposes.",0
"I was eating my dinner alone,
sitting on the living-room couch
watching a movie on TV for company
when the forces your covetous presence prevents
slowly crawled out in fibrous droves.
Without you to follow me with your
clipboard, or record the game my face plays,
masquerading as a cryptic territory
and your field of study, the energy maggots
turned the furniture into an ectoplasmic
mass with the weight of iron: soft but
resistant, a taut balloon against the hand.
Hypnotized by the atmosphere I fell asleep,
and the chair took revenge on my psyche.
I could not scream, so I focused my will
on pushing back against the animate matter.
I was near failing when I managed to utter
the word ""dove,"" and then you shook me awake.
""Stop,"" stop fighting with the furniture, you said.
Yet something I could not see pushed hard
against me, and it was not a force for good.
My vocal chords were paralyzed and the language
of the living was the only way to stop it.",0

"When asked to write about my subconcious it just blocked everything that was in my mind. Let me see. well today I went to this Sigma Phi Omega Rush event and that has been in my mind ever since. Everyone there was so nice, everyone was smiling and introducing themselves and it makes me wonder is that how they really are? Or are they just doing that to get us to like their organization so they can take our money? Maybe I'm being paranoid, but those people were just really very very friendly that it felt like some horror flick full og nice smiling faces and they wait for the right moment to attack. During this event they had us fill out a questionare kind of like an application. One of the question was ""What quality do you have to contribute to the organization?""  The thing was I couldn't think of anything to say. I mean I am not a talented singer or anything or a pianist. I am just me. Isn't that enough? Then later on they interviewes us and they taped us! How embarrasing! They asked questions that will catch you by surprise! Like ""What song best describes you?"" I was like ummmmmmmmmmm OH OH the first thing that popped in my mind was Butterfly by Mariah Carey. I just made up some bogus answer that it symbolizes freedom and independency. honestly though I had no idea at the time what Butterfly was about or was talking about. I wonder if they know!? Oh well. I've been debating with my friends if I should join or not because it seems like a great experience meeting new people and all. The only thing that I am worried about is will they accept me for who I am or do I have to be the typical sorority chic? and I forgot to mention. Pledging is the big secret it is supposed to last 8 weeks! and no one can mention what exactly goes on during this 8 weeks!  DO we have to clean toilets or what? Maybe that is why they keep it a secret because once all the Rushees know about it they will think again before they join. Makes me wonder what pledging is all about. A lot of people think that joining a sorority is a good idea especially for social reasons. I would describe myself as friendly and sometimes outgoing, but I can be pretty shy with strangers. is that weird? It's just that some people I meet is just that I have no idea what to talk about, it is as if I freeze and don't know what to say. It is also kind of embarrasing because you look like a total fool if you don't know what to say or do especially with someone who doesn't know you very well. I think the reason why I sometimes feel that way, is that I feel intimidated and I feel really awkward. Like I do right now because I feel like I am runing out of things to say. Actually to think about it sororities do take up much time. Just to go to Rush events I have spent approximately 8 hours already and I haven't even been in it yet. It was for two organizations. Tomorrow is the party and I am not really looking forward to it because deep down inside I want to stay in my dorm and study instead of going to the Club. Lately I have been lazy and haven't been doing much but I promise myself that I will study and get the grades my parents deserve to see after all they've done for me. And if they ever find out I went to these meetings instead of study they won't be so proud. But I think one of the reasons that parents don't understand these tings, is because all they want me to do is study. I guess going and Rushing for these sororities is kind of my way to rebel. I know it sounds weird, but that is how I feel.",0

I pray for his mom to get better but I just don't know. I want to promise him everything is going to be alright but I just can't. I wish he would stop drinking to make the pain go away but I guess if it makes him feel better right now. Who am I to tell him what to do anyway? I wonder what time Michael's game is tomorrow. My mom told me but I forgot. Maybe I should have gone to Dallas this weekend. I don't know? I think anything's better that being in Odessa. Football is such a big thing here. Of course the first thing we do is go to Jeesong's football game as soon as we got here. I'm glad Ajay doesn't do anything as dangerous as that I already worry about him enough. I really think we are maturing in our relationship, learning to work through problems that most couples don't ever have in their entire lives. I don't know what he's going to do if he loses her too. I know she wants to be with his dad but isn't it selfish to leave your children. Catherine just came in here to ask me what time I was going to get up. I said 10 but that wasn't early enough so we decided on 9:30. I am very happy with my schedule because I don't have a class before 9:30 and I like all of them. One thing about school I hate is that I'm always so tired. Why can't I check my stupid email from my house? You would think a major computer system at a major university would have some way you could check it without having to download this and that. You should be able to enter your IF or UTEID and open a link site, but no. Nothing is that easy. I hate computers and if I never had to use one I wouldn't mind a bit, but if I didn't know how I couldn't pass any of my classes. That is another thing. Why is everything I need for a class on the internet? I feel sorry for people who have no clue how to use it. I thought Kris was never going to hook up her computer but she finally discovered she had no choice. Computers are our lives these days. What would the human race do without them? It's scary you know, our whole life is on this thing and if they know what their doing, anyone could find some thing you don't want them to have.",0

I wanted to write an epic about suffering,
but when I found a tendril
of her hair among the ruins
of her mud house,
I found my epic there.2
I didn’t sleep last night.
As if the night
were hiding in the morning coffee.3
Her life is a game of snakes and ladders
sent relentlessly back to square one,
but whose life isn’t? She takes a breath
and throws the dice again.4
The city glitters below
the airplane window, not because
of the bones and skulls scattered
under the sun, but the view
through the frosted breather hole.5
She died, and time changed
for those she loved most,
but her watch kept ticking.6
A god carried the burdens
until the weight persuaded him
to transfer them to man —
the new suffering god.7
The map of Iraq looks like a mitten,
and so does the map of Michigan —
a match I made by chance.8
If you can’t save people,
at least don’t hate them.9
Her bubbling annoys me —
can’t understand a word she says.
So what if I toss her from the aquarium?
So what if I spill her new world
with this nasty immigrant fish!10
The city’s innumerable lights
turning on and off remind us
we are born to arrive,
as we are born to leave.11
The handkerchiefs are theirs,
but the tears are ours.12
Women running barefoot.
Behind them, stars falling from the sky.13
So strange,
in my dream of us,
you were also a dream.14
He said to me: You are in my eyes.
Now when he sleeps,
his eyelids cover me.15
Gilgamesh stopped wishing
for immortality,
for only in death could he be certain
of seeing his friend Enkidu again.16
Some say love means
putting all your eggs
in one basket.
If they all break,
can the basket remain intact?17
The homeless are not afraid
to miss something.
What passes through their eyes
is how the clouds pass over the rushing cars,
the way pigeons miss some of the seeds
on the road and move away.
Yet only they know
what it means to have a home
and to return to it.18
The wind and rain
don’t discriminate
in buffeting us.
We are equal
in the eyes of the storm.19
When I was broken into fragments,
you puzzled me
back together
piece by piece.
I no longer fear
being broken
in any moment.20
Freezing in the mountains
without blankets or food,
and all they heard wasno news is good news.21
Their stories didn’t kill me
but I would die if I didn’t
tell them to you.22
Before killing them
they collected their personal effects.
Their cell phones are all ringing
in the box.23
We are not upset when
the grass dies. We know
it will come back
in a season or two.
The dead don’t come back
but they appear every time
in the greenness of the grass.24
If yearning encircles us,
what does it portend?
That a circle has no beginning
and no end?",0

"Developmental psychology is the scientific study of how and why human beings change over the course of their life. Originally concerned with infants and children, the field has expanded to include adolescence, adult development, aging, and the entire lifespan. Developmental psychologists aim to explain how thinking, feeling, and behaviors change throughout life.  This field examines change across three major dimensions, which are physical development, cognitive development, and social emotional development. Within these three dimensions are a broad range of topics including motor skills, executive functions, moral understanding, language acquisition, social change, personality, emotional development, self-concept, and identity formation. Developmental psychology examines the influences of nature and nurture on the process of human development, as well as processes of change in context across time. Many researchers are interested in the interactions among personal characteristics, the individual's behavior, and environmental factors. This includes the social context and the built environment. Ongoing debates in regards to developmental psychology include biological essentialism vs. neuroplasticity and stages of development vs. dynamic systems of development.",0
"When I first heard you on the phone
your voice had to be that '40s wartime voice
for it to get under my skin like it did,
after seven years asleep.
You’re at the beginning of something, you said,and I’m at the end of something;
but you didn’t go away,
twice-born, three times, coming around,
rough cello.
Late days
I want to drive to your grave,
But I don’t belong to it.",0
" Arguments for the reading of classical literature:  Cultural literacy: Classical literature provides a foundation for understanding Western culture and history. Many contemporary works draw on themes and motifs found in classical literature, and without knowledge of these works, readers may miss important allusions and references.  Intellectual development: Reading classical literature can help students develop critical thinking and analytical skills. The complex plots, characterizations, and themes found in classical literature can challenge students and push them to think deeply about the world around them.  Literary value: Classical literature has stood the test of time and is still read and studied today because of its literary value. Shakespeare, for example, is widely considered to be one of the greatest writers in the English language, and his works continue to be performed and adapted in various forms.  Arguments against the reading of classical literature:  Lack of relevance: Some students argue that classical literature is no longer relevant to modern life and that contemporary works would be more meaningful and relatable. They may find it difficult to connect with characters and situations that are vastly different from their own experiences.  Inaccessible language: The language used in classical literature can be archaic and difficult to understand, especially for students who are not native speakers of English. This can be a barrier to engagement and comprehension.  Limited diversity: Classical literature tends to be written by white, male authors and may not reflect the perspectives or experiences of a diverse range of people. This can be problematic for students who are looking to explore different perspectives and experiences in literature.  In conclusion, while there are arguments for and against the reading of classical literature in English classes, ultimately it is up to individual educators and schools to decide what works best for their students. A balanced approach that includes both classical and contemporary literature can provide students with a well-rounded education and appreciation for the rich literary traditions of the English language.

" Fame and fortune are often seen as desirable goals in our society, but they can also have significant impacts on a person’s life. Some of these impacts may be positive, such as recognition, wealth, influence, and opportunities. However, some of them may be negative, such as isolation, mistrust, loss of privacy, stress, addiction, and identity crisis.  According to some psychological studies12, fame can change a person’s sense of self and their relationship with the world. Some celebrities may develop a split between their “authentic self” and their “celebrity self”, as a way of coping with the demands and expectations of fame. They may also feel like they are living in a bubble, a cage, or a fishbowl, where they are constantly watched, judged, and invaded by others. They may lose touch with their roots, their values, and their true friends. They may also become addicted to fame itself, as a way of filling a void or escaping from their problems.  Fame can also affect a person’s fortune, both positively and negatively. On one hand, fame can bring financial rewards, material comforts, and access to resources and privileges. On the other hand, fame can also bring financial risks, such as overspending, lawsuits, taxes, and frauds. Fame can also make a person more vulnerable to exploitation, manipulation, and betrayal by others who want to profit from their fame or harm their reputation.  Therefore, fame and fortune can change a person’s life in many ways, both good and bad. The way a person deals with these changes depends on their personality, their values, their support system, and their coping skills. Some celebrities may be able to handle fame and fortune with grace, humility, and responsibility. Others may struggle with fame and fortune and succumb to its negative effects. Fame and fortune are not inherently good or bad; they are what we make of them. ",1
"Emotions run wild,
Heartbeats are strong,
Words can't describe,
What's been going on.

Happy and joyful,
All the colors of the rainbow,
It's like an eternal spring,
And life seems to glow.

Arousal runs through me,
It's a burning heat,
Passion consumes me,
My heart skips a beat.

Fear grips me tightly,
A cold icy grasp,
My heart races faster,
A feeling that will last.

As I sit in sadness,
A weight on my chest,
Tears run down my face,
As I try to forget.

Love is the strongest,
Emotion of them all,
It's what binds us together,
And makes us stand tall.

Emotions are complex,
It's hard to understand,
But without them in our lives,
We'd no longer feel human.",1

What sign to post on the sill that says, ""Warning, large glass window.

There are seeds in the feeder and water in the bath.

" Causes of not voting in elections:  Apathy or lack of interest: Many people simply do not care about politics or feel that their vote will not make a difference.  Inconvenience: Some people may not vote because they find it difficult or inconvenient to get to the polling station, especially if they are busy or have other commitments.  Disillusionment with politics: A lack of trust in politicians or the political process can lead to people feeling that voting is pointless or ineffective.  Inaccessibility: Certain groups of people, such as those with disabilities or language barriers, may face obstacles that prevent them from voting.  Voter suppression: In some cases, efforts to suppress certain groups from voting can lead to lower turnout.  Effects of not voting in elections:  Decreased legitimacy of election outcomes: When fewer people vote, the legitimacy of the election outcome may be called into question.  Under-representation of certain groups: Low turnout may result in certain groups being under-represented in government, which can have negative consequences for their interests and needs.  Policy decisions may not reflect public opinion: If fewer people vote, policy decisions may not accurately reflect the views of the public.  Missed opportunity to influence change: Voting provides an opportunity for citizens to influence the direction of their government and society, and not voting means missing out on this opportunity.  Reduced accountability of elected officials: When fewer people vote, elected officials may be less accountable to the public, as they may feel that they do not need to cater to a wider range of voters.

"They said I got away in a boat
And humbled me at the inquiry. I tell you
I sank as far that night as any
Hero. As I sat shivering on the dark water
I turned to ice to hear my costly
Life go thundering down in a pandemonium of
Prams, pianos, sideboards, winches,
Boilers bursting and shredded ragtime. Now I hide
In a lonely house behind the sea
Where the tide leaves broken toys and hatboxes
Silently at my door. The showers of
April, flowers of May mean nothing to me, nor the
Late light of June, when my gardener
Describes to strangers how the old man stays in bed
On seaward mornings after nights of
Wind, takes his cocaine and will see no one. Then it is
I drown again with all those dim
Lost faces I never understood, my poor soul
Screams out in the starlight, heart
Breaks loose and rolls down like a stone.

Creating beauty, anew.

A sight that reaches far and wide,

It smells like chocolate in here which is making me even more hungry. I miss my cousin Tabby so much being three hours away is too far. I wonder what my brother is doing right now. He probably has football practice. I hope we win the football game this weekend. That reminds me, last weekend was so crazy I don't think I am ever going to drive someone else's car again. Gee that was an adventure though. I think I should wash clothes later because the pile is getting pretty high. Why does my phone light keep turning off and on? I really need to get a new one already. I hope my friend likes the birthday present I bought him. Everyone deserves a great present on their twentieth birthday! That new cd that I bought is great I actually feel like listening to it right now. Oh great I have calculus homework. That stuff is so confusing. It was just yesterday when I was talking to Joseph and he was saying he is having a hard time in his class over at Tech. He said, I wonder what I got myself into.

My brother and sister are always saying I have ""middle child syndrome,"" but what is that anyway. I wonder if my dad is out of work already. He always has a busy work load. Man I never realized how many sacrifices he has really made for our family. I mean considering he is the only working parent and he has two children in college. Wow my dad is really smart too. And what do you know my dad and sis are alike in so many ways. I wish Tabby would come and visit us. I think it would be even better if she came to college up here too instead of back home. I am really attached to her. I mean we have spent almost everyday of our lives together and now I barely even get to see her on the weekends, and with college, it makes it even harder to keep in touch.

"Fetteresso Castle is a 14th-century tower house, rebuilt in 1761 as a Scottish Gothic style Palladian manor, with clear evidence of prehistoric use of the site. It is situated immediately west of the town of Stonehaven in Kincardineshire, slightly to the west of the A90 dual carriageway.  Other notable historic fortified houses or castles in this region are Dunnottar Castle, Muchalls Castle, Fiddes Castle, Cowie Castle and Monboddo House. Prehistory From cropmarks in the ""policies"" (improved areas) around Fetteresso Castle, there is evidence of a ring ditch sited at the north end of a cursus.  A cursus is a prehistoric set of parallel linear structures of unknown purpose that were, somewhat fancifully, considered by antiquarians as used for some type of athletic competition, possibly related to hunting or archery; this is unsubstantiated. In 1822 a cairn was discovered near Fetteresso Castle with some human remains inside. The size and shape of the chamber made of unhewn whinstone clearly show that the burial site was a Bronze Age construct. Some legends say that this is the grave of Malcolm I, who is recorded to have been slain at Fetteresso in AD 954. The burial hillock has become known as Malcolm's Mount, even though it is not likely from current archaeological analysis that the crypt could be so recent. In 1998 a burial urn from the Beaker people was found at Fetteresso Castle. The Roman Camp of Raedykes is located several miles north-west, where a full legion encamped and many archaeological recoveries have been made. This location is one of a string of marching camps that connected Angus to Moray.",0

"last night was pretty good and all. I was glad to see everyone thats in san antonio again and javi who is still at home and hating it. but who can blame the guy, weslaco isn't exactly the place one would want to be. I just feel bad for junior, he feels totally alone and stuff. javi and him are the only two who are still at home and all, but junior never talks to javi because he doesn't like what javi does on his spare time, so because of that, he doesn't talk to him as much. I was just glad he called on davids birthday to wish him a happy birthday and to talk, I miss that guy a lot, I just wish hed get off of his lazy ass and do something. he isn't working or going to school, hes just at home feeling sorry for himself and ballooning. all I could tell him is that he needed to do something to occupy himself and to not just sit thete and feel sorry for himself. hopefully he'll be here in austin visiting soon. speaking of getting off your ass, I need to get on the ball and stop procrastinating. high school might have been somewhat of a breeze through (a walk in the park) but college isn't the same, needless to say. dad said this is the rest of my life I'm preparing for, and there isn't a day that goes by that I don't say that quote to myself at least a hundred times because I'm being lazy. I miss dad, and mom and everyone else. yea we all hate eachother and get at eachothers throats but thats why we're family, only we can talk to eachother the way we do and get away with it. much like me and my friends, because friends are family too, even knowing more about you than you might through observation. regardless, I love austin, its a great town, there is so much to do, and a lot of time to do it in, but with all this free time you need to do it in moderation, because too much of a good thing can be bad for you. I hope grandma is ok, I miss waking up and telling her ""buenos dias, como manecio"" and her being amazed that I'm even at home and even more amazed at the time it is that I wake up. I just hope nothing happens to her. I feel sorry for mel and all the trauma that she is probably feeling. she just had a kid, her husband is being accused of something we are all sure that he had nothing to do with, and the damn police with their false accusations the they are giving her, as well as the threats, in order to get her to tell them the information they believe she has, but which in fact she doesn't. because no matter how bad the news, she would come to my family first and let us know before her own mother would know, because she is like my oldest sister, and she is probably the closest cousin that I may have. damn, I miss georgie. stupid punk with too much time on his hands and he knows it. procrastinator in the making just like me. I miss listening to my punk and ska with him, he was the only person that liked it as much as I did, and I didnt even force him to like it. funny now though, in austin one would say that its a bit ""trendy"" to like this music, but in weslaco. its not really known. and even less played on the damn radio. speaking of radio, it sux. except for some stations in austin. and I don't know the call letters. I'm bad at remembering things. I guess that may be why I procrastinate. my dad has always told me that its impossible to forget things as quickly as I do, so I know he doesn't believe me when I say ""I don't remember"". but in fact, I really don't, and its not because I drink like every day or because I'm on a drug, because yes I do drink, but not in large quantities (binge drinking) like some people and I only do so on the weekends strictly never on school days, and I don't do drugs. speaking of drugs, I knew it was easy to get them at my hometown if u wanted them, but austin is like a haven for those who feel the urge to get away. already I have open invitations from people I've met and seen a few times to go and smoke out with them, and one guy who said he could get me any drug I wanted free for the first time. I can just brush these things aside because they don't interest me or anything, but I get some weird looks from other people nearby who can hear the conversation, but I don't let that bother me, because if they are going to judge me from what they hear and not by who I really am, they arent worth my time. my dad told me to never judge anyone by what is heard and said, and I never have. some of my best friends today were spoken bad of before I had ever met them. now we're as close as brothers in a sense. I love my friends, I don't really know what id do without them. my biggest fear doesn't seem to be what kind of future I have or if I will ever be successful, or if I will let my parents down (god forbid though), but my biggest fear is never seeing my friends again. but when I think about it, its the stupidist thing, because today, the world is smaller than ever, and anyone can be found with the click of a button. so I don't really know why I feel this way or anything, nothing traumatic has happened to make me feel this way, so I don't really have an explanation for this feeling, and being the smart ass that I am making fun of everything with a comment for everything, this really does scare me",0

Its a sad   thought really, that studying has to ever come first in life, isnt all you'll   ever know what you truly experience, won't you only find happiness in   yourself and other people? so why study so much on things that   tend to affect you so little, why don't we interact more, shouldnt we be   put into groups of people with different backgrounds and cultures,   learn understanding and acceptance, that would save more   problems.

"In mathematics, an almost periodic function is, loosely speaking, a function of a real number that is periodic to within any desired level of accuracy, given suitably long, well-distributed ""almost-periods"". The concept was first studied by Harald Bohr and later generalized by Vyacheslav Stepanov, Hermann Weyl and Abram Samoilovitch Besicovitch, amongst others. There is also a notion of almost periodic functions on locally compact abelian groups, first studied by John von Neumann. Almost periodicity is a property of dynamical systems that appear to retrace their paths through phase space, but not exactly. An example would be a planetary system, with planets in orbits moving with periods that are not commensurable (i.e., with a period vector that is not proportional to a vector of integers). A theorem of Kronecker from diophantine approximation can be used to show that any particular configuration that occurs once, will recur to within any specified accuracy: if we wait long enough we can observe the planets all return to within a second of arc to the positions they once were in.",0

A moment of glory, that's worth all the fuss

To improve my skills, and never to bail

The pride and the joy, that would make me so proud

I visualize each move, each step, and each play
I strategize, analyze, and find my own way
I learn from my losses, I grow from my gains
I never give up, and never stand in disdain

I imagine the moment, when the game is done
And my hard work and practice, have finally won
I hold up my trophy, with tears in my eyes
And relish the moment, that feels like a prize

So I press on, with each game and each round
With determination and passion, in every bound
For I know that the game, is more than just fun
It's a challenge, a journey, and a victory to be won.",1

Good dreams where I don't want to wake up; like the one I had when I was little and it was so cool there were these lonely French 12 year old kids in it and I was standing outside their house window or something; they remind me of mafia and the untouchables; my secret song that I swear is about the untouchables. I wish I knew what song it was. That would be great. I wonder if I'm making too much of my friend 'coming out'. Like I'm ok with it, and most everybody is ok with it, but I might be trying to sound TOO ok with it. I don't know. My roommate's parents don't like me, I don't think. But I'm not entirely sure so I shouldn't even think that, let alone say it. Or write it. Aren't I supposed to be typing about my feelings? Ok, I feel like I keep trying to prove myself to my friend Angela, just cause she is so wonderful and I don't feel too wonderful myself a lot of the time. But I don't try to prove myself to her; I did to my friend Ali, but not to Angela. I don't even know what I'm talking about right now. I hate that; I'll think something about somebody just cause I had thought it about someone else. And I don't know if that's bad or good or whatever. I'm typing too much too fast; I keep getting myself confused and backspacing. I wonder if I should just leave all the misspellings in here; it might make sense so far as the paper goes, since maybe that would suggest that my mind's confused and jumbled, the way handwriting is supposed to tell about you, but I don't know at all. Cause we're supposed to correct our misspellings. The Buddy Holly song is in my head. Does that mean I should sing it to the paper since it's in my head and whatever's in my head should be going down here? No, I don't think so; it's kind of like background music; jazz to Kerouac type of thing. I wonder if I'm as important to Grant as he is to me. That goes with all my friends. He should be here soon; no tape for me. This makes no sense, I'm sure; I sound horrible, like Adrian Mole, except for I keep criticizing myself as Adrian keeps complimenting myself. My back hurts; I wonder if my doctor who I went to once was right when I said I was going to have neck and back problems later, just cause I don't have the greatest posture in the world. I mean, my philosophy professor said today that if pleasure is virtue then he was virtuous in smoking, and he wasn't lying, but I don't think that there is any virtue in slouching. Is this what fist person books are supposed to be like? Cause characters would never be able to write this much; no, what I meant was that it would sound dumb and pointless and rambling like this, unless they had some superb, Staten island computer guy like mind. Like that last reference wouldn't make any sense at all to anyone but me; in books they describe it. I don't know. Like Kerouac I guess. Bless you. There, I said it in response to my roommate's sneeze on here at least. I don't think of her as Elizabeth, cause she's not, she's my roommate. Elizabeth's a dead girl who used to laugh at a camping trip where she got sick on the day of a campout; no a bonfire; who used to like peanut butter. Elizabeth did, not the peanut butter. Why is everyone homesick (or my roommate). I'm not; I want to talk to my cat though. He's going to hate me when I get home. Like, it'll be like when my mom took him into surgery and he would run away from her. I hope he doesn't die. I'm missing all of the little things in between these thoughts; the thoughts I have while I'm typing. I would try to type those things too but then there would be things while I was typing that. I hate paper, I miss trees. There goes my roommate complaining again. But I'll stop, cause she might come over and read over my shoulder or something and I'll have to stop like I did the first time I tried to do this exercise; that was horrible, it was only 2 minutes into it, but still. But she came close to here, and I don't know. Good, she's on the phone now. I'm staring at the little monitor light on my computer; it looks like some alien symbol for sex or something; I don't know what I'm thinking (tip of the tongue) but its weird whatever it is. I want to be in Rocky Horror. I wonder what it's like to be in it; just in the movie, not the little plays during it. Yesssssssss, noooooooooooo. I don't know. It's 8:22. Why the hell did I type yessssssssss? Remember on the Wonder Years, and they would have to go to typing class; that's what I think my mom's childhood was like. My lips feel like they're about to fall apart if I smile again; not because I've been smiling too much, because they're really chapped along the edges. Two minutes left. Yess. I did it again. I want to go out to breakfast; real breakfast, with eggs and pancakes you don't have to tear apart with your teeth to cut. I'm looking at my chopsticks now; I wonder why people are so fascinated with them, why I brought them, I don't know at all. And I'm feeling bad about having a goodluck elephant made out of ivory, cause doesn't that go against the good luck of elephants?",0
"On January 12, 2010, three people were killed and four others were wounded by a gunman at the Penske office in suburban Denver. The shooter, Patrick Crusius, later pleaded guilty to three counts of first-degree murder and one count of attempted murder.  The shooting at Penske Office Park in Centennial, Colorado is widely considered to be one of the deadliest workplace shootings in United States history.",1
" Two people of different interests and backgrounds could become unlikely allies if they share a common goal, face a common enemy, or recognize a mutual benefit. Unlikely allies are those who overcome their differences and cooperate for a greater cause, often in times of crisis, challenge, or opportunity. History and literature are full of examples of unlikely allies who joined forces to achieve remarkable outcomes.  One of the most famous examples of unlikely allies is the alliance between Franklin Roosevelt, Winston Churchill, and Joseph Stalin during World War II. These three leaders represented different political systems, ideologies, and cultures, and had many conflicts and suspicions among them. However, they realized that they had to work together to defeat Nazi Germany and its allies, who posed an existential threat to their nations and the world. Despite their disagreements and mistrust, they coordinated their military strategies, shared intelligence and resources, and negotiated the post-war order. Their alliance was crucial for winning the war and shaping the modern world[^1^][1].  Another example of unlikely allies is the partnership between mPedigree, a social enterprise that fights counterfeit drugs in Africa, and several multinational pharmaceutical companies. mPedigree developed a technology that allows consumers to verify the authenticity of their medicines by sending a code on the package to a free number and receiving an instant response. This innovation has saved many lives and reduced the market for fake drugs. However, mPedigree faced resistance from some drug manufacturers who feared that their products would be exposed as counterfeit or substandard. To overcome this challenge, mPedigree approached some of the leading pharmaceutical companies and convinced them to adopt its technology as a way to protect their brands, increase their sales, and improve their reputation. By collaborating with mPedigree, these companies became unlikely allies in the fight against counterfeit drugs and improved their social impact[^2^][3].  A third example of unlikely allies is the friendship between Huck Finn and Jim in Mark Twain's novel The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. Huck is a white boy who runs away from his abusive father and Jim is a black slave who escapes from his owner. They meet on an island in the Mississippi River and decide to raft together to find freedom. Along their journey, they face many dangers, challenges, and prejudices, but they also learn from each other and grow closer. Huck overcomes his racial biases and sees Jim as a human being worthy of respect and compassion. Jim becomes a father figure and a loyal friend to Huck. They become unlikely allies in their quest for liberty and happiness.  These examples show that two people of different interests and backgrounds can become unlikely allies if they have a compelling reason to do so. Unlikely allies can overcome their differences and achieve remarkable outcomes by working together for a common goal, facing a common enemy, or recognizing a mutual benefit. Unlikely allies can also enrich each other's lives by learning from each other's perspectives and experiences.         ",1
"Hello looks like a journal entry. Frustrating blank page as usual, not nearly as much  pressure as a true journal might be. No, true journals (at least the ones I know) come complete  with the most irrational, egotistical, subjective criticisms at all. Here, I might simply start to list  adjectives. Think I will. Chair, run, cake, spoon, sparrow, harly, make, spy, insult, laughter,  organization, economy, ----- complete crap!!! Ha! Adjectives are fun. What to make of this  phenomenal opportunity?  Don't be shy, be compliant. Or just spew forth venom, anecdotes,  general life lessons. Inclination says talk about ""me"". Here's what that is. Or so we'll try. Music, menus, frustration. Solitary, isolated, friendship social butterfly. Making waves the size  of anthills, feeling pretty depressed about it. The color of the water is green. Count the levels  of meaning there. Anaphor. Hyperbole. Homonyms. Czech Republic. Czeska Republica. The  United States of my Ass. Could I say here that I want to ______ the president?  Protect Identity. The blank might have been filled with ""make love"" or ""marry"" or ""help through important  issues"". Certainly not ""castrate. ""  What else?  Looking forward to making A's lots of A's, because  after all purpose belongs to those classes in which one might be rewarded for hard work and  ass kissing. Discombobulated this page may be, but organization's overrated. I know a quote:  one advantage of being disorganized is that one is constantly making new discoveries. ""  That  one's right above Dad's desk at the office. Why do I experience comfort in an environment less  than rational? or organized?  Possibly the same reason I love psychoactive mindbenders (by this,  of course, I refer to puzzles and games like scrabble!) Because true beauty in life exposes itself  not in the routine, as religious dogma might promise, but at an Indian buffet at which one can  stand before a plethora of unfamiliar treasures, waiting for the unfamiliar perspective of a  Western mind for validation. what else?  I think this weekend I'm going to stimulate myself with  something organic - or possibly inorganic - and clean up the house. Make normal people  sense of the place so that when Mom and Dad show up tomorrow they don't swallow their  tongues. Music makes everything voluptuous, adds another layer to experiences so that they  find their way to memory lane more frequently and effectively. Takeover from an armchair. Natural delicacies. TV numbs, music accentuates, pleasure reading enriches, highest level math  and science is God. School puts the kind of pressure on people that creates Ted Bundies. UT is  anything but a good school, just like college immidiately following high school is anything but a  good idea. Just going doesn't plant seeds of positivity or success. I was the fool, caught in the  wave of college matriculation, and still to this day I feel I need four more years. Just like that  fucking idiot GW Bush. Right now, and not because I endorse the use of any of the following  terms, I'm going to type into this mind drain a slew of derrogatory or defamatory terms that I  rarely use but that for some reason are to come out when I open the floodgates. It's because I  wanted to call Bush a faggot, or a fucking idiot, or a fucking shithead hyppocrite, but some  mechanism that pisses on creativity and ultimate truth caught me in the act and slapped my red  hand before any other utterance could follow. Well, here, you fuck, stop this!!!!  Oh, I was going  to go into some racial slurs, but that's just so stupid. How about cracker-ass whitebread honky  guerro americano puto!  that would be perfect for me. Still, something about WASPy racial slurs  isn't nearly as intimidating as ""nigger"" or ""spic"" or daggerhead, or whatever. This world exists  as a cesspool of religious dogma, hate, and a need to evolve. It's going to suck till that evolution  takes place, but God Damn it, I'll wallow in the shit till I die and I'll like it. Couldn't qualify, for  that reason, as the typical ""good people"" one might imagine a large percentage of those floating  around Earth for some god or cause might hope. That's what makes music --- done. Thanks  for the toilet!",0
"An early sadness for the future
(as in dreams of myself young and sad)
accompanies my departure towards
a conventional story: a town
of girls a New York City dormitory.
And so a trail proceeds from
our house on the top of the hill
down the back way of former army barracks
and past the borrowed church (ours had no tank)
where I was baptized
reasoning “it must be true” out of
the love I had for my mother.
And Tony’s house there across the street from it
absolutely in the Mexican gully
in dreams of which he and I still fight armed enemies
he stepped on a land mine in Nam
when I remind my brother, twenty years after
his face contorts he knows the look of that death
a week before he himself dies
blood-tinged ruddy-winged, but that’s another
dream-site the Needles Cemetery inelegant
unbeautiful and dear and dry.
See how many loves, how much thus sadness
in the future begins to
haunt that walk down that hill
towards the highway away to the dormitory
as I go to New York to sever love’s connections
and make the “real ones” generated by
actual mating by beauty and clothes
the black wool suit with its three button jacket
the oddly puffed-sleeved orange sweater
and an orange and midnight-
blue paisley waistless dress.
New trail there,
Brett knows my future love though I don’t
hitchhikes with him to California
years before I catch up to the poets in Iowa City
that will be in ’69, my brother
hasn’t yet signed up for Nam then
when he gives me rattles off a rattler
which I keep in my wooden India box I still have
until they stink.
I can’t keep track of the track there’s nothing but
sidetrails of love and sadness so love is
all that makes my people act they go to war for love
you know, of who and what you are
like I was baptized by
the cruellest-lipped prissiest-mouthed man in the world
for love, but I could just have gone swimming
walked back up love’s hill
back up at the house you can get to the pool
barefoot if you can find enough
bush or telephone-pole shadows.
We’d all swim together
I’d tread water dreaming of the future
but a wilder larger eye birdlike
distant holds the pool in its pupil
anyone’s that too, and hold the enlarging
water sad how not be
why don’t the smart girls in New York know this
why don’t you or I know what we know
the eye and the water both enlarge still why don’t
smart girls in Paris, yes larger but will never flood
the containing eye, but why not
and sometimes it does
when you or your own are the news.",0
"well, write now I guess there are a lot of things going through my head, but it's hard for me to put them into words I guess. well I had fun last nite. i went to a party witha bunvh of friends. a lot of people were drinking, but iwas one of the few that wasn't drinking. it seemed like everyonw who was drinking had fun, but I had fun, even though I didnt drink. i had fun just dancing an d meeting people. i met a lot of guys, which wus good. since I usually am kinda shy bout meeting peopple. anywyas. i'm really tired right now, because we only went to sleep around 6, even though we came home around 430, and I had to get up at 11 because a friend from out of town styed over, so I had to help them pack and get ready to leave and stuff. gosh, I lkie so many guys right now, but I think that my other friends like the sme guys that I like, or at least they think he's cute too, but I don't know what to do aobut it. oh well, I guess I'll jus have to figure somthing out. man, I have a lot of homework to do today. actually I need ot catch up on my reading. i have a lot of reading to do in this class, then I have chem homework and calculus homework. i'm so lost in my chem class. well, not lost, but I wish I knew someone else in that class, so I could at leasst have someone to do homework with or jus to call if I had any questions, buti  guess I should just start meeting people in there, or someting, because I really need to find a study buddy in there. I think that's my only class that I don't know anyone in. i have friends in my language class, and in my calculus class and in my psych class. i just don't kno anyone in my chem class. but hopefully that will change soon. oh today either my roomate's dad or my dad called today, but this guy that was in our room picked up the phone, and our partents are really strict about guys, so I hope I don't get in trouble. the guy who picked up the phone covered it up pretty well, but then we expected our parntets to call again, but no one ever called, so I kinda got worried, that they would think that we have guys in our room. oh well, I think I may be getting worried over nothinh. because they probably wont even say anyting, or even know. oh well. oh, I have a minute left in my writing assigment, so I guess that's it",0
"  Habits are an integral part of our daily lives, and while some habits are healthy and productive, others can be harmful to our well-being. Whether it is a physical, emotional, or financial habit, it is important to recognize the negative impact it has on our lives and take steps to break it. In this essay, I will convince readers to break the habit of smoking, which is not only detrimental to physical health but also has a significant financial cost.  Smoking is one of the most harmful habits that an individual can develop, and it is also one of the most addictive. Smoking damages nearly every organ in the body and is responsible for a wide range of health problems, including lung cancer, heart disease, stroke, respiratory disease, and many more. Not only does smoking have a significant impact on physical health, but it also affects the emotional well-being of the individual, leading to anxiety, depression, and stress.  One of the primary reasons to quit smoking is the financial cost associated with it. The cost of cigarettes continues to rise, and the habit can quickly become a drain on one's finances. In addition to the cost of cigarettes, there are also numerous hidden costs associated with smoking, including health care expenses, higher insurance premiums, and lost productivity due to illness. By quitting smoking, individuals can save money and use those funds for more important things such as education, travel, or investing for the future.  Another important reason to quit smoking is to improve overall physical health. Smoking damages the respiratory system, making it difficult for the individual to breathe and perform daily activities. Quitting smoking can improve lung function, reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke, and increase overall life expectancy. Additionally, quitting smoking can improve the appearance of the skin, teeth, and nails, and reduce the risk of developing wrinkles and other signs of aging.  Finally, quitting smoking can have a positive impact on emotional well-being. Nicotine is a highly addictive substance that alters the brain's chemistry, leading to feelings of anxiety, depression, and stress. By quitting smoking, individuals can break the cycle of addiction and improve their emotional state, leading to greater feelings of happiness, confidence, and well-being.  In conclusion, smoking is a harmful habit that can have a significant negative impact on physical, emotional, and financial health. It is crucial for individuals to recognize the negative effects of smoking and take steps to break the habit. By quitting smoking, individuals can improve their physical health, save money, and experience greater emotional well-being. It is never too late to quit smoking, and the benefits of doing so are well worth the effort.    ",1
"most of my regrets         have to do with water, light    filtered through shower curtain, your skin          like yellowed paper. i sat on bathroom                  tiles cold like clammy hands i didn’t want to hold and waited for you. i didn’t think to be embarrassed then.  neither                           of us could sleep that night.        the floorboards creaked and    only now do i feel guilty about sneaking into bed with you.  but that was months ago. in a room         i’ll never see again parts of us have begun to die.  they say that every seven years your body replaces      each cell it has ever known.  soon i will be new again.  some nights in my dorm room i wake up crying and there’s nothing                          humble about it. when moonlight spills across    my bed like ilfosol-3, gets caught in my throat like a soreness,  it isn’t because i miss you. rather, the dark room at my old high school where i used tongs  to move your picture from one chemical bath to another. in a room i’ll never see again your face develops right in front of me.  stop bath, 2014 by Allegra Lockstadt",0
"A fool I was to sleep at noon,
And wake when night is chilly
Beneath the comfortless cold moon;
A fool to pluck my rose too soon,
A fool to snap my lily.
My garden-plot I have not kept;
Faded and all-forsaken,
I weep as I have never wept:
Oh it was summer when I slept,
It's winter now I waken.
Talk what you please of future spring
And sun-warm'd sweet to-morrow:—
Stripp'd bare of hope and everything,
No more to laugh, no more to sing,
I sit alone with sorrow.",0
"This is my writing I always feel like everything should have a title. Somebody told me I was anal last night. I don't think so though. I've always thought myself to be rather easygoing. Church always made us be nice to people. That's another thing, people always tell me that I'm ""like the nicest person I've ever met!"". I don't see it. I may be easygoing but I do not consider myself nice. I think I'm just not mean so people think I'm nice. I'm not. You should see how I treat the men in my life. The poor boys don't have a clue. Marques hopefully will never find out because I actually do love him a lot but I just can't seem to settle down for anything. That's got to be some kind of mental deficiency don't you think. Oh well, around this campus I think I am one of the only sane people around here. I'm saying that like I think I'm sane. I don't think I am. I like William a lot too. He's so strong and ""Mr. Cool"" like. I'm always attracted to the strong cute ones. I guess it's some kind of complex about my tiny stature that I always go after big men. I can't believe Marques got up to almost 300 pounds this summer. He is really making me mad though because he is not helping my constant state of confusion that I have been dealing with lately. I hate typing. I don't have anything to say anymore. I wish I had a twinkie and a juice box. I do need to go to the grocery store. Eckerds is just up the street though so I'll go up there if I can ever get caught up on all my work. I am going to try to make it to the Delta party tonight. I think everybody's going to be there. I hope William is there. He's such a cutie and he likes me a whole lot. He gave me these two massive hickies on the sides of my neck. They look really bad and they kind of hurt too. Oh well, at least I've found somebody that I like. I wish Marques was here so that I could take my mind off of all these cute men. My nursing class is cool. Are you sure that you wanted us to just type whatever comes to our minds. Well, I don't think you want to get inside my mind. There's a whole lot of stuff that should not be open to the public right now. I guess everybody thinks like this though. I can't call myself different because sometimes I know that I am different. I don't think like everybody else I know. I think I'm a little bit on the crazier side than they like to think I am. Okay, I have been typing for 12 minutes now. I told you that I don't have anything to say. It's not like I don't write in my journal every night. I know how my mind works and I don't particularly like it. I happen to think I'm a little nuts, but who isn't. This isn't all about me though. I'm not the teacher so I guess I just have to sit here and type until your hearts content. That's what I'm here for. My mom tries to make people happy too much. She had to go to a craziness doctor a few years ago because she almost had a nervous breakdown. I thought it was funny though so maybe that's mean of me but if you knew my mother you would think it was funny too. She's not a very nice lady and she bothers me way too much. I wish she would stop calling and acting like that good little mother that she always want to be. She's not. I love my daddy. He called while William was still in the bed this morning. Not good. He kept tickling me and my dad was kind of getting suspicious but William plays too much anyway. I need to go take a nap and it's been more that twenty minutes so I'll talk to you later.",0
"I really don't have a clue what to write about but I guess I'm supposed to think of what I'm feeling which is that my tank top's straps are really bugging me because they keep falling down and I keep looking at the pictures on my desk instead of the screen and what I am writing my refrigerator keeps making an annoying buzzing sound but I am concentrating on it anyway since I have to keep in touch with my senses. I keep staring at these pictures like I'm afraid to look at the screen or something it is a picture of me and my two friends from high school in our bathing suits acting like morons. there is also a lot of dust on my desk and on the picture frames and I really think I should clean them off, but I am pretty lazy so I doubt I will do that there is dust on everything around my computer!. the printer, the keyboard, the mouse pad, the phone and the pictures. my neck keeps itching; its probably from the dust or something. I can't believe I've only been typing for three minutes. this is going to be a very long paper, but this assignment is definitely a lot more fun than all the other ones in my other classes. uhoh the phone is ringing and I don't know whether to pick it up or not! I guess I can't because that would be breaking the rules! so I didn't and now it stopped and a really loud voice came on the answering machine of course the message wasn't for me I already had my really really good and nice phone calls for the day. I guess you could call me one of those losers that really misses home. I miss my boyfriend and my friends in the picture on my desk and my dad. and I miss my mom, but she's not at home, at least not technically because she's dead. this should be interesting to see where this thought leads because I have noticed in myself that whenever I think about my mom my brain won't let me and it starts thinking about something else like what I will wear tomorrow or something totally irrelevant. my mom was nice and I have a picture of her in my room but I can't really see it from where I am now because it's above my bed it makes me sad to think about her and when I do, like now, it makes me want to cry. I think that my brain realizes I will be too sad when I think about it so it won't let me. that is kind of nice of it, but sometimes when I just want to think about it, it won't let me. now my wrists are hurting from typing so fast for so long and my back is itching and it is getting very hot in here our room is always hot. my mom was always hot and we had to keep our house freezing cold nobody wanted to come to my house in the winter because it was so cold. it didn't matter this past winter, though, because she wasn't alive and I could turn the heat up if I wanted to because no one would yell at me for doing it. My dad would sometimes, but he doesn't really care. He'll yell at me to put on a sweater or something because I am costing him too much money when I can just put a sweater on but my dad is nice, not as nice as my mom, but he wasn't as understanding or shy as her. when she first died he was very understanding about everything but now he is the same as he always was there is a picture of us above my bed that I can see well it is of us dancing at my brother's wedding like ten years ago we were really happy then and we are now, too, I guess he just got married again so there was some tension there but its gone now for the most part, despite what he says. he is in Ireland now with his new wife because that is where she's from and her dad is dying so they went to see him. I liked her dad; he was a funny Irish guy he has cancer; it seems that everyone dies of cancer, although my mom didn't. my mom died because of an incompetent fire rescue ambulance squad and bad cop who will go to hell when he dies, hopefully. it bothers me that I am so bitter about him and the ambulance squad but I can't help thinking that my mom would still be alive if it weren't for them. now I only have five minutes left to go I am extremely itchy I am never this itchy in any other given twenty minutes, I guess its just the stress of actually having to think about my thoughts. the people outside are being so loud and annoying you think that if you were on the ninth floor you wouldn't hear stuff on the ground so far below, but you can. I keep going from staring at the pictures to staring at the screen; I'm afraid to look anywhere else I guess so now I am just sitting here listening to the people outside, enduring my itches, and thinking about how I've almost written a whole entire page on absolutely nothing relevant. I guess some parts were relevant because they made me pay attention to my surroundings and what my brain actually thinks I think it will be cool to go back and reread this. this was a fun assignment except my wrist really hurts now and my arms are sagging like how they tell you not to do on the anticarpel tunnel syndrome commercials and papers. but I only have one minute left now and I can't wait because my wrists are hurting and I don't think they can take much longer. I haven't typed in so long unless you consider email a valuable typing time which I don't because my emails are never a page and some long! ow. ow ow ow. those people are s",0
" As an AI language model, I don't have personal preferences, so I don't have a favorite author, sports figure or performer. However, I can discuss the life events of a well-known sports figure, Serena Williams, and how they relate to her achievements.  Serena Williams is a professional tennis player, widely regarded as one of the greatest athletes of all time. She was born on September 26, 1981, in Saginaw, Michigan. Serena began playing tennis at a very young age, under the tutelage of her father, Richard Williams.  Throughout her career, Serena has faced numerous challenges and setbacks. In 2003, she suffered a knee injury that kept her off the court for several months. She bounced back in 2004, winning the Australian Open, Wimbledon, and the US Open.  In 2010, Serena suffered a pulmonary embolism, which caused her to miss almost a year of competition. However, she returned to the court in 2011 and won two Grand Slam titles that year.  In 2017, Serena announced her pregnancy and took a break from the sport. She gave birth to her daughter, Olympia, in September of that year. Serena returned to tennis in 2018, and despite struggling with postpartum complications, she made it to the Wimbledon and US Open finals that year.  Throughout her career, Serena has won 23 Grand Slam singles titles, the most by any player in the Open Era, and 14 Grand Slam doubles titles with her sister Venus Williams. She has also won four Olympic gold medals in doubles and one in singles.  Serena's achievements on the court are a testament to her determination and resilience. Despite facing numerous obstacles, she has continued to work hard and remain focused on her goals. Her dedication to her sport, her mental toughness, and her ability to overcome adversity have made her a role model for aspiring athletes around the world.        ",1
"Whispers of the Ocean's Song

The waves, they crash against the shore
Their melody, a haunting score
A constant rhythm, ebb and flow
A song the ocean does bestow

Whispers of the ocean's song
Echo in the breeze, all day long
A symphony of sound and light
A peaceful, soothing lullaby

The salty air, it fills my lungs
I close my eyes and softly hum
The ocean's song, it brings me peace
A sense of calm that will not cease

Whispers of the ocean's song
A gift to all who come along
A reminder of the beauty here
Its wonder, nothing can compare

So listen close, and you will hear
The whispers of the ocean's song so clear
A symphony of sound and peace
A harmony that will never cease.",1
"Burning Bush  is a 2013 three-part Australian miniseries directed by Belinda McClaren. It is a historical drama set in the early years of the Australian settler colonies, and tells the story of a convict woman, Rose, who is transported to the new world in search of a new life.  Burning Bush was screened on Foxtel's History channel in Australia on 5, 9 and 12 October 2013. The miniseries was produced by Australian production company Madman Entertainment in association with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. It was filmed on location in Victoria and New South Wales.  Burning Bush has been met with mixed reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the miniseries has an approval rating of 50%, based on 14 reviews, with an average rating of 5/10.   The Guardian's Peter Bradshaw gave the series 3 out of 5 stars and wrote: ""This three-part saga about Rose (the talented newcomer played by Essie Davis) is absorbing enough that you'll forgive McClaren for not finding a more interesting or challenging subject.""   IGN's Dan Stiles awarded the miniseries 8 out of 10 and called it ""a beautifully shot and well-acted period drama"". However, he added that ""its slow pacing will frustrate some viewers"", while Empire magazine's Tom Huddleston awarded the series 3 out of 5 stars and wrote: ""McClaren's languid direction occasionally lets Burning Bush descend into soap opera territory, but Davis'",1
"I am a little irritated right now. I just did this thing for about 5 minutes and then my computer just like shut off!  I cannot believe I just spent those five minutes only to just have it all erased. Things like that irritate me a lot. I always just hate having done something and then it being useless. I guess that could be kind of an insecurity but yeah. I am not going to psychoanalyze myself. I guess since this is one of thise things that could do that for me. I wonder if this will get picked to be read. Probably not. Its getting done way early. I can't really see the reasoning behind the whole stream of consciousness thing. I mean yeah you can track your thoughts but couldn't you do that just by paying attention to yourself?  I dunno. just one of those things I guess. Moving on then. I'm eating a rice krispeys treat thing. I get hungry when I am irritated. I have to wonder how evolution made us that way. What is the point of eating when you are irritated. Shouldn't you want to do stuff?  that would make sense in the whole flight or fight mode sense kind of way. I am glad i have an apartment it doesn't smell here and the neighbors are really nice. Of course  you don't make a forced acquaintance like you would if you lived in a dorm I guess but this is more private and I can work on the bills and homework alone. Maybe I'll go out tonight with one of my new friends. I don't have plans and I'm not really interested in going to the game, as if I had the money to go anyways. Money is going to become an issue later. I should try and get a job this semester but i just don't want to get burnt out on my first semester. I don't really need the money but it would be nice in case of an emergency. And who doesn't like a little extra spending money?  I don't know i need to find somewhere close to work but i don't want to have to work as a cashier again. I hated doing that. Not as much as working as an area host(janitor) at a certain theme park. Not at all fond memories of the sausage shack and the bathrooms accompanying it around high noon. Its stupid how people have no real common sense when they go out to have fun. Honestly, who doesn't realize that a urinal is not made to be pooped in. It would hate to know the person who didn't understand what a urinal . URINal, is for its use is right there in the name c'mon people!  But yeah my lips are chapped really bad. I should find my chapstic otherwise I'll smile at someone and then make a weird face because I split my lip. Eminem is on now. Repeat of the MTv Movie Awards. He's not really a bad rapper assuming I can even even judge that music. But he honestly is about the whole shock value of his music probably. Just like many of his little fans. I have a really nice view of the septic area behind the aparmtments an dthe little balcony shows a wonderful scene of the vagrants coming out of the woods. I got that last part from a couple of my neighbors. The one seemed really witty, another was very . bubbly, and of course there was the one with a boyfriend. They are really nice I hope to get to know them more. Wow its almost time to stop the whole stream of consciousness. Just four more minutes. My nipples itch. I think its because of the new shirt I'm wearing. Wow that was kind of out there. You know what's funny assuming   you   were a person and could reply that is. I hope I don't become one of those people who just talks to themselves all the time.  But the funny thing is that I have a pencil sharpener in my room. Yet I only have mechanical pencils  That seems kind of pointless. Oh that is kind of punnish. I really need to find a book to read. I hate not having something immediate to do. Doing nothing is just not a strong suit. I miss my family now that I think about it. I think I'll give them a call today. I don't want them to think I don't care about them even though I'm away.",0

" Offer emotional support: Being sick can be a very difficult and lonely experience. Simply being there for your friend or relative and listening to them can provide much-needed emotional support. Express empathy and let them know that you care about them.  Help with practical tasks: When someone is sick, they may have trouble with everyday tasks such as cooking, cleaning, or grocery shopping. Offer to help with these tasks or run errands for them. You could also offer to pick up their medications or drive them to doctor appointments.  Provide a comfortable environment: If your friend or relative is staying at home, make sure that their environment is comfortable and conducive to healing. This could involve things like bringing over blankets or pillows, adjusting the lighting or temperature, or playing soothing music.  Offer to communicate with healthcare providers: If your friend or relative is having trouble communicating with their healthcare providers, offer to help them by taking notes, asking questions, or relaying information.  Provide entertainment: Being sick can be boring and lonely. You could offer to bring over books, movies, or games to help pass the time.  Remember, everyone's needs are different, so be sure to ask your friend or relative how you can best help them.        ",1

"Today I woke up really late and I had to run to class which made me tired. My math class is so easy I don't even know why I'm in it. Well actually I do it's because I'm in this FIG and that is pretty cool. It helps a lot. I don't know what exactly I'm supposed to write but I'm trying to just keep going. I know that I am happy today because my girl friend Ginger is coming to town and I haven't seen her in a week. That also includes my mother. I really miss her and I know that she is lonely. I also miss my brother and sister and even my dad. I wish I could play video games and party with my brother like we used to before I left. Speaking of partying I haven't done any of that since I came to Austin which is supposedly this huge party city. I think the reason that I haven't partied is because I have not been able to meet many guys here yet and that is usually who I go party with. I also miss my party pals from Arlington they weren't my best friends but they were a blast to go party with. I wonder how they are doing right now. I think they are probably skipping class for no reason, again. I don't know why you would skip class in high school it just gets you into too much trouble. I never got in trouble in high school until the last day when me and a lot of senior guys rode our bikes up to school and then through the school. That got us Dhall, but it was worth it because the bike thing was really fun. In fact all of high school was really fun except  no all of it was fun. It was easy there was always a party and I had a group of good friends to hang out with which made it even better. Those kids who are still there do not know how lucky they are to still be there. I mean I love college and everything but it is just way different. And living by yourself isn't all its cracked up to be. I mean I have to clean my room, do my own laundry, and stuff like that. I also think that I had good morals installed in me because I feel really bad when I party in my room, which I thought I would do all of the time. But I guess that also has to do with my roommate. He is just fresh in from India and is not that accustomed to living in America yet. But he is a lot cooler than I thought he was once I sat down and talked to him. I guess if you give people a chance most of them come through, except for the real jerks. I am listening to Prodigy right now and it is really fun to listen to I fell like writing down what it sounds like but since it is techno it would broadly be difficult for me to accomplish that. I wish that I had the musical talent and equipment to do something like that, but I have neither the time or musical capacity to really do that.",0

" Manners refer to the social behaviors and customs that dictate how people should interact with one another. The specific customs and expectations surrounding manners have evolved significantly over time, reflecting changes in social norms, cultural values, and technology. Here are some ways in which manners have changed over time:  Formality: In the past, people were expected to be very formal and use specific titles and modes of address when speaking to others. Today, people are generally more casual in their interactions, and titles are often dropped in favor of first names.  Technology: With the advent of new technologies, such as smartphones and social media, manners have changed to reflect new forms of communication. For example, it is now considered rude to use your phone during a face-to-face conversation, while texting and messaging have become common ways of communicating.  Gender roles: Over time, gender roles and expectations have shifted, leading to changes in manners. For example, it is now considered acceptable for women to initiate conversations with men and to pay for dates.  Table manners: Table manners have also evolved over time. In the past, formal dinners involved multiple courses and elaborate etiquette rules. Today, meals are generally less formal, and manners are more relaxed.  Diversity and multiculturalism: With increased diversity and multiculturalism, manners have become more inclusive, with an emphasis on respecting and celebrating different cultures and traditions.  Overall, manners have changed significantly over time, reflecting changes in social norms, cultural values, and technology. While some customs and expectations have persisted, others have shifted to reflect the changing needs and expectations of society.        ",1

Pennsylvania Route 3 (PA 3) is a state highway in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania. The highway runs from US Route 219 in Lewisburg east to US Route 11 near Reading. PA 3 is a narrow two-lane road that passes through rural areas of the state. The route has two concurrencies with PA 61 in Lewisburg and Bedford and a brief overlap with PA 127 near Mansfield.  PA 3 was designated in 1928 to run from US Route 611 (now US Route 220) in Mount Pleasant east to US Route 11 near Reading. The route was extended west to Lewisburg in 1930 and east to Mansfield in 1951. The western terminus was moved to its current location in Lewisburg in 1962. PA 3 was realigned along Main Street from Lewisburg to Mansfield in the early 1990s. The route was rerouted along County Road 218 between Lewisburg and Bedford in 2006.,1
"The challenge I hate the most
Is one that often haunts
It's the task that drains my soul
And renders me nonchalant

It's the haunting of my dreams
And the anchor to my life
The challenge that I hate
Is one that causes strife

It's the feeling of defeat
That I cannot seem to shake
The challenge that I hate
Is one that makes me break

Despite my many attempts
I cannot seem to conquer
The challenge that I hate
Makes me feel like a monster

In moments of despair
I ponder why I try
The challenge that I hate
Calls for a darker sky

Yet still I press on
For I know that I must fight
The challenge that I hate
Will not best me tonight

So I grit my teeth and brace
I put forth all my might
The challenge that I hate
Will not win this fight

For deep down in my soul
I know that I am strong
The challenge that I hate
Will not keep me for long

So though it causes pain
And makes my heart feel heavy
The challenge that I hate
Will not defeat me completely.",1
"On September 13, 2020, most of the original cast members of the 1987 film The Princess Bride took part in a virtual live dramatic reading of the film script to support Wisconsin Democrats. The returning cast included Cary Elwes, Robin Wright, Mandy Patinkin, Chris Sarandon, Christopher Guest, Wallace Shawn, Billy Crystal, and Carol Kane, with additional performances by Rob Reiner as the Grandfather, Josh Gad as Fezzik, Eric Idle as the Impressive Clergyman, Whoopi Goldberg as the Ancient Booer and the Mother, and Jason Reitman as the narrator, among others. Norman Lear joined the Q&A session at the end, which was hosted by Patton Oswalt. Cast members promoted the event beforehand using the hashtags ""#PrincessBrideReunion"" and ""#DumpTrumperdinck.""  More than 110,000 viewers donated a dollar or more to Wisconsin Democrats to view the livestream, which raised $4.25 million and received widely positive reviews, with special praise for Patinkin's performance. Origin of event The idea to recruit Princess Bride cast members for a fundraiser was inspired by a benefit event organized by Wisconsin Democrats that reunited cast members of The West Wing. According to the Hollywood Reporter, Cary Elwes (Westley in the film) approached a friend who knew Ben Wikler, chair of the Democratic Party of Wisconsin to ask if he could help raise money for the battleground state. Wisconsin Democrats and others promoted the virtual script reading with digital ads and social media. Elwes began teasing the event in his Twitter feed in early September 2020, announcing it openly on September 4:#Inconceivable! I’m excited to announce a virtual #PrincessBrideReunion! Chip in any amount at the link & get an invite to this special event on Sun. Sept. 13th with myself, @RealRobinWright, @PatinkinMandy, @robreiner & many more! #DumpTrumperdinck.",0
"British jazz is a form of music derived from American jazz. It reached Britain through recordings and performers who visited the country while it was a relatively new genre, soon after the end of World War I. Jazz began to be played by British musicians from the 1930s and on a widespread basis in the 1940s, often within dance bands. From the late 1940s, British ""modern jazz"", highly influenced by American Dixieland jazz and bebop, began to emerge and was led by figures such as Kenny Ball, Chris Barber, John Keating, John Dankworth, Tony Crombie and Ronnie Scott, while Ken Colyer, George Webb and Humphrey Lyttelton emphasised New Orleans, Trad jazz. From the 1960s British jazz began to develop more individual characteristics and absorb a variety of influences, including British blues, as well as European and World music influences. A number of British musicians have gained international reputations, although this form of music has remained a minority interest within the UK itself. History",0
"You know I always wonder if I'm ever doing the right thing in life by coming to this university and not going somewhere else. I had opportunities to go to other universities but I chose to stay close to home. My parents always want it there way! They basically chose my major for me and when I wanted to change it, they became upset and really didn't want to see my face which made me upset. I want to do what my parents tell me to do but if it does not interest me and I know I'm going to stress over it, why should I bother to listen and I went with what I felt was best for me and I made the change. I always wonder how some people are so intelligent and others try so much but can't reach the level of that intelligent person based on academics. I see people trying so hard to make that A in that one class where the intelligent person doesn't take one ounce of effort to even study and this person would make a higher grade on the exam then the person who tried so hard to learn the material and study so hard on the exam. One thing which confuses me is how girls think. They're like in their own world sometimes. You try to be so nice to them sometimes and they look at you like you're the biggest IDIOT! I wish they would open up more around guys and not just talk with their girlfriends all the time. They should be able to tell their guy friends anything they tell their girlfriends. Why do the Astros suck so bad this year? They had a perfect baseball team and they're playing like a bunch of high school boys. They were recognized as favorites this season and they're ranked last in the division. They're is no excuse for being so mad especially a team so talented like the Astros. I mean if you had Bagwell, Biggio, Alou, Caminitti and other stars, wouldn't you expect your team to be good?? The rockets need to do better next year also. I can't believe they didn't pick up any free agents this summer. They could have really improved this year with all the talented free agents and they made the mistake of not picking up anyone. If they want to be really good again, they're going to have to pick up some talented free agents or they're not going anywhere and even in danger of not making the playoffs. I don't know why some teachers just don't tell us what will be on the exam. It would be so much easier to study the material but NO, they make us study everything even the non important information which really pisses of students, especially me. One thing I really love in the University are the girls. They are so damn hot! Only if I could have one of them would I show them what kind of man I really am!

The company also had a strong focus on customer service, with employees known for their friendliness and willingness to help.  Greig's supermarkets were particularly popular in the Vancouver area, where they operated more than 20 stores.

Floats a fluffy white cloud, you see,
Drifting and dancing with ease,
Sunbeams illuminating its tease.

A wisp of vapor, ever-changing,
Shape-shifting as the wind's arranging,
From delicate whiteness to gray,
Its mood and color can sway.

Sometimes it's puffy and round,
Other times it's stretched on the ground,
Silver linings and shadows greet,
A heavenly view of nature's feat.

In summer, it provides a shade,
A respite from the sun's harsh blade,
In winter, it hides the stars,
A soft blanket for our planet's scars.

A symbol of imagination's wing,
A muse for dreams and fantasies,
A bridge to the heavens, and all its entities.",1

A professional MMA competitor from 2002 until 2013, he most notably competed in the UFC in the Middleweight division, compiling a record of 12–10 in 22 appearances for the organization. Leben first appeared in the inaugural season of The Ultimate Fighter reality series, and also fought in the now-defunct WEC. He began his UFC career with five victories in a row before suffering a knockout loss to future UFC Middleweight Champion Anderson Silva, and was known for his toughness and powerful left hand. Leben was the inaugural WEC Middleweight Champion. Background Leben is from Portland, Oregon and has one older brother and one younger sister. He grew up without his father around, and he did not even meet his father until he was 23 years old. Because of this, Leben's mother worked hard for many hours daily as a bartender so that she could support the family. Growing up Leben enjoyed skateboarding, dirt biking, and snowboarding. When he was in middle school, he began watching the UFC and became very interested in MMA. He began training in boxing, and then was on the wrestling team at Benson Polytechnic High School, picking up the sport rather quickly.

" Benjamin Franklin's statement suggests that money cannot bring happiness. While it is true that money alone cannot guarantee happiness, it is also true that financial stability and security can contribute significantly to a person's overall well-being. Studies have shown that poverty and financial stress are strongly associated with negative health outcomes, such as depression, anxiety, and physical health problems.  On the other hand, it is also true that having a large amount of money does not necessarily lead to happiness. Many wealthy people still struggle with mental health issues, relationship problems, and other personal challenges that money cannot solve.  In essence, the relationship between money and happiness is complex and multifaceted. While financial stability and security can improve a person's well-being, it is only one factor among many that contribute to overall happiness. Other factors, such as relationships, purpose, and a sense of meaning and fulfillment, are also essential to a happy life.  Ultimately, the role of money in happiness depends on the individual and their unique circumstances. For some people, financial stability may be a crucial factor in their happiness, while for others, it may not matter as much. It is important to recognize that happiness is a subjective experience and cannot be reduced to any single factor, including money.         ",1
"Pennsylvania Route 3 (PA 3) is a  state highway located in the southeastern portion of Pennsylvania. The route runs from U.S. Route 322 Business (US 322 Bus.) in West Chester east to PA 611 in Philadelphia. The route begins in downtown West Chester and heads east out of the borough as a one-way pair of streets. Between West Chester and Upper Darby, PA 3 follows a four-lane divided highway named West Chester Pike through suburban areas. Along this stretch, the route passes through Edgmont, Newtown Square, Broomall, and Havertown. The route has an interchange with Interstate 476 (I-476) between Broomall and Havertown. Upon reaching Upper Darby, PA 3 heads into Philadelphia along Market Street. In Philadelphia, the route follows multiple one-way pairs, running along Chestnut Street eastbound and Walnut Street westbound in West Philadelphia before heading into Center City Philadelphia along Market Street eastbound and John F. Kennedy Boulevard westbound and ending at Philadelphia City Hall. Philadelphia and West Chester were linked by a dirt road dating back to 1793. The Philadelphia and West Chester Turnpike Company was created to build a toll road between the two places in 1848. The turnpike was built as a plank road between Philadelphia and Newtown Square in the 1850s before becoming a stone road in the 1880s. A horse-drawn rail line was built along part of the turnpike in the 1850s and a trolley service was introduced in the 1890s. The state took over the West Chester Pike in 1918. In 1927, the route was designated as part of PA 5. PA 3 replaced the PA 5 designation between West Chester and Philadelphia in 1937. Trolley service was replaced by buses in the 1950s to allow for the widening of PA 3 between West Chester and Philadelphia to four lanes. By 1960, PA 3 was shifted to end at US 13 in Southwest Philadelphia. The routing was shifted to US 13 west of University City by 1970 before the route was extended east to Philadelphia City Hall during the 1970s.",0

"The forest beckons with its green embrace,
A tranquil world, its own time and space.
I wander beneath the old, wise trees,
Each one a guard and every breeze
A voice of a story that history weaves.

A hidden shelter from city noise,
A sanctuary of purest joys,
The rustle of leaves, the hum of the earth,
All speak of the secrets of the woods' worth.

The damp earth beneath my feet,
Alive with roots and freshly beets,
The crisp air fills my lungs with life,
All trace of worry, all trace of strife,
Vanish within this forest's hushed veil.

The birds flit and hop their way,
Among the branches, a joyful play
Of music that soothes the troubled soul
And heals the heart, making one whole.

The forest is my natural altar,
A holy place, where I come to alter
My thoughts, my behaviors, my very being,
Communing with nature, and just breathing
The calm that flows from this hallowed ground.

Thanks, oh forest, for this perfect spot,
Where I can be me, where I feel I've got
A place in this world, among the trees
Where life's burdens lie at their knees,
And I am free, to feel alive, and not be caught.",1

"Wow, I really don't know what to write. All I know is that I'm kinda behind on  my studies. The bad thing is that it's only been the first couple weeks of  school. I know I shouldn't procrastinate like this, but I just can't seem to help it.  That's why I'm doing this assignment at the last minute. Bad, huh?   Hummmmm, this chair is kinda uncomfortable. I just took  a shower and my hair is still kinda damp. I have really long hair, so it takes quite awhile for it to dry completely. I really miss my boyfriend. The funny thing (at least it's funny to me is that I'm Vietnamese and my boyfriend is black. Well his father is black and his mom is half Arabic and half French. My boyfriend,  Mohamed, was born in Africa but moved to Paris when he was only one years old. He's lived there for the past 18 years or so and have been here in the U. S for only two  years. He speaks five different languages. Pretty impressive, huh?  I have no idea why he hasn't called me yet. I haven't seen him in two weeks. I miss him sooo much. I wonder if he misses me or not. What do you think?  My problem is that  I'm not calling him until he calls me first. That's just the way I am. The guy always has to make the first move. I guess if he really wants to talk to me or hear my voice, then he will sooner or later pick up the phone. I really hope he will call soon. I really, really miss him. I guess it has to do with the fact that he is my very first boyfriend. If my parents ever find out I'm seeing a black guy, they would absolutely FREAK!  That's how they are. Actually, that's how  I kinda was. I told myself I would never ever like anyone but Asian guys. Boy, was I wrong. You know what, my arms are kinda getting tired now. For some  reason, I'm sitting real straight up in my seat. I never do this when I'm just  typing for the heck of it. Maybe the fact that I know this is for a grade makes  me a bit uneasy. Oh well, I don't mind. There, I kinda sat back a bit and it  feels a little bit better now. I just yawned. great, I need to stay up kinda  late tonight to do some other homework. I have ten more minutes but I don't know what else to write. I guess I type kinda fast, and so it seems as though I'm  writing a whole lot, huh?  I don't know how you are going to grade this. I know  it's gonna be a completion grade, but how are we going to benefit from this. I  bet you're just making us do this so whenever you don't have anything to do, you can just pull these up and give yourself a good laugh at our expense, huh?  NO, I'm just kidding. . Oh, Oh, OH, OH, yeah, yeah. I love you more than I can say. , I'll love you twice as much tomorrow, Oh, OH, I love you more than I can say. OH, don't you know I  need you so, OH tell me please, I gotta know. Do you mean to make me cry?  Am I just another gal,  That was just a song that I usually sing when my mind has nothing else on it. How do you like it?  It's kinda funny how sometimes I think of myself as pretty decent looking and at other times, I think I'm the ugliest troll. Why is that?  One day I would have complete confidence in myself and the next day I would feel so small and vulnerable. Why is it kinda weird for me to meet guys, especially Asian guys. Well, I kinda know the answer to that question. Since I'm Asian and I want to meet an Asian guy, I tend to feel more self conscience when I'm  around them and that results in a behavior that's not really mw. I've noticed lately that most of my guy friends are white guys. Because I don't really see them as a potential romance interest, I am very relaxed and calm with them, and I guess we just click like that. I know I should do the same with Asian guys, but it's hard just b/c they're Asian, also. Why is it so complicate, man?  Well, tomorrow, my friend Cheryl and I are gonna take a bus to the mall. I've only been on the  bus twice here around campus. I've never taken a bus on a highway before. I  have a feeling it's gonna be quite an experience for the both of us tomorrow. Wish me luck. Man, my whole arm is aching now!!!! Isn't that weird?  Okay, I'm gonna stop Bye-bye. . . . . . . . . .",0
"Pavel Filippovich Nilin (Павел Филиппович Нилин, January 16 [o.s. January 3] 1908, Irkutsk, Russian Empire – October 2, 1981, Moscow, USSR) was a Soviet writer, journalist and playwright, best known for a novel called A Man Goes Uphill (1936), adapted to the big screen under the title A Great Life, for which he, as a scriptwriter, received the Stalin Prize in 1941. Highly popular was his 1956 novel Cruelty. Biography Pavel Nilin was born in Irkutsk, into the family of a political exile. After the 1917 Revolution he worked as a criminal investigation officer in the town of Tulun, Irkutsk oblast, then in 1927 embarked upon the career of a journalist, moving from Siberia first to Povolzhje, then Ukraine and finally Moscow. He debuted as a published author in 1936 with a series of short stories published by the Novy Mir magazine.

"In Finnish folklore, all places and things, and also human beings, have a haltija (a genius, guardian spirit) of their own.  One such haltija is called etiäinen—an image, doppelgänger, or just an impression that goes ahead of a person, doing things the person in question later does. For example, people waiting at home might hear the door close or even see a shadow or a silhouette, only to realize that no one has yet arrived. Etiäinen can also refer to some kind of a feeling that something is going to happen. Sometimes it could, for example, warn of a bad year coming. In modern Finnish, the term has detached from its shamanistic origins and refers to premonition. Unlike clairvoyance, divination, and similar practices, etiäiset (plural) are spontaneous and can't be induced. Quite the opposite, they may be unwanted and cause anxiety, like ghosts. Etiäiset need not be too dramatic and may concern everyday events, although ones related to e.g. deaths are common. As these phenomena are still reported today, they can be considered a living tradition, as a way to explain the psychological experience of premonition.",0

a workshop, we exchange stories

so many teams of men, they orbit in silence and
loud vests and helmets, they stoop with a sweetness
and sift the granules, then, they rise,
oblong, hunched, on fire,
ready to dig into the ice, a new boundary for the national vortex,
this undeclared war; the almost-uttered war, this war begins,

" Arguments for mandatory seatbelt use:  Safety: Seatbelts save lives and reduce the severity of injuries in car accidents. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), seatbelt use reduces the risk of death and serious injury by about 50% in a car accident. In addition, seatbelts prevent occupants from being ejected from the vehicle, which is one of the most dangerous outcomes of a crash.  Cost savings: Seatbelt use can lead to cost savings in healthcare and insurance costs. Unrestrained occupants are more likely to suffer severe injuries, which require extensive medical treatment and rehabilitation. This results in higher healthcare costs and insurance premiums for everyone.  Public health: Promoting seatbelt use through mandatory laws can improve public health by reducing the number of fatalities and injuries from car accidents. This benefits not only the individuals involved in the accidents but also their families and communities.  Arguments against mandatory seatbelt use:  Personal freedom: Some people argue that mandatory seatbelt use violates their personal freedom and individual rights. They believe that adults should be free to make their own choices about whether or not to wear a seatbelt.  Effectiveness: Some opponents of mandatory seatbelt use argue that seatbelts are not effective in all types of accidents. For example, in rollover accidents, the roof can collapse and crush the occupants, regardless of whether or not they are wearing a seatbelt.  Enforcement: Mandatory seatbelt laws require enforcement, which can be costly and resource-intensive. Police officers have to monitor and issue citations to drivers who are not wearing seatbelts, which takes time away from other law enforcement activities.  In conclusion, while there are arguments on both sides, the evidence overwhelmingly supports the use of mandatory seatbelt laws. Seatbelts save lives, reduce healthcare costs, and improve public health. While some may argue that mandatory seatbelt use violates personal freedom, the benefits of seatbelt use outweigh the potential drawbacks.       ",1

" Dear School Officials,  It is my pleasure to offer my opinion on how a recent large donation from an alumnus could be allocated in the most beneficial way for our school. I believe that this sum of money should be invested in improving the school's infrastructure and facilities to enhance the quality of education provided to our students.  To begin with, I strongly suggest that a portion of the donation be used to modernize our classrooms and laboratories. Upgrading the technology and equipment in these facilities will enable teachers to create more dynamic and interactive learning experiences for our students. This will also improve the school's overall academic performance and attract more students and teachers to our institution.  Secondly, I propose that the funds be used to establish a scholarship program for underprivileged students. This will provide opportunities for deserving students who might not have the financial means to attend the school. By offering scholarships, we can ensure that we provide equal opportunities to students of all socio-economic backgrounds, making our school a more diverse and inclusive place.  In addition, I suggest that a portion of the funds be used to enhance the school's extracurricular activities. Activities such as sports, music, and arts programs are just as important as academics in the development of well-rounded students. By investing in these programs, we can offer students more opportunities to discover their talents and develop their skills.  Finally, I recommend using a portion of the donation to create a research fund for faculty members. This will enable teachers to carry out cutting-edge research in their respective fields, which can contribute to the development of new knowledge and ideas. By doing so, the school can enhance its reputation as a center of academic excellence.  In conclusion, investing the alumnus's donation in improving our school's infrastructure and facilities, establishing a scholarship program, enhancing extracurricular activities, and creating a research fund will create a ripple effect that will benefit the school and its community for years to come. I hope that my proposal will be considered seriously and will help guide the allocation of the funds for the greater good of the school.  Thank you for your time and attention.       ",1
"Okay, I guess this is what all my English teachers described as ""stream of consciousness. "" I believe I did an assignment similar to this in 11th grade. I'm not sure. I wonder how long this writing assignment will be. How much can I possibly type for 20 minutes straight without stopping? What if I get a phone call? Do I answer it? Anyways, I cannot believe I am in my second week of college. It is kind of what I expected. The freedom can me nice at times, but I do miss my home. I do not miss high school at all though. I didn't like high school one bit. I am more homesick than I ever thought I would be, or could be for that matter. I never thought of myself as someone who would get homesick. But here I am, always wanting to call home. Michelle's birthday is tomorrow. I wish I could fly down to spend the day with her. I hope mom remembers to give her the CD I made her. The CD reminds me of Justin, whom I also miss a lot. I miss all my friends, all my best friends. One of which is at UTD, one going to Northwestern in a few days, and one attending Texas Women's. I really wish I could transfer, or they would transfer to UT. I miss them all so much. Wow, it has only been 5 minutes. I don't know if I have 20 minutes of gibberish to write about. This stream of consciousness thing is harder than it seems. I know I tend to ramble on a lot but it is quite different when you are doing it for a class assignment. It is also hard for me because I am so used to typing with abbreviations every time I chat online, making this assignment a lot more difficult. After completing this, I am going to wait for a phone call from my best friend. Then, meet up with someone at the library, where I hope to get a lot of studying done.

My eyes are starting to hurt now, and I still have a headache. Today is Monday. Tomorrow is Tuesday. Tomorrow is going to be a very busy day, from beginning to end.

I hope I don't get hungry tonight at the library. I cannot believe I ate so much today at lunch. It is all Leeting's fault. All that starch cannot be good for me. I really hope I do not gain a lot of weight while in college. I'm really scared that I will. I haven't been going to the gym as often as I would like. I think I might start going every Friday or so. Maybe on the weekends too, seeing as how I haven't been in Austin for the weekend since school started. Maybe that is why I still have not put together a regular schedule. I haven't really been here for a full week. Well, this will be my first full week in college. Not as exciting as I thought it would be. I think I might call home after I finish this assignment. I'm almost done, thank goodness. I really am running out of things to type. I think I am all drained out. I hope I do not fall asleep studying tonight. I really need to get stuff done.",0
"Memories are like little fragments in time
That we store away in the corners of our mind,
Tiny bits of joy, love and pain alike,
Etched deeply in the depths of our psyche.

Some memories are sweet, like a summer day,
Filled with laughter, joy and love that came our way,
We cherish them close and cling to them tight,
As we journey through life, both day and night.

Others are bitter, like a winter's storm,
Memories of hurt, loss and thoughts forlorn,
We try to forget, but they linger on,
Haunting us like a ghost from whence they come.

Memories are like a puzzle in our minds,
Each piece a moment, a story or a sign,
They form a tapestry of our past lives,
And shape the person we become in time.

The ones that bring you hope, love and cheer,
For they are the treasures that we store,

" Dear School Officials,  I am writing this letter to express my concern and disappointment regarding the recent decision to disband the club to which I belong. As a student who has been actively involved in this organization for some time now, I strongly urge you to reconsider this decision.  The club in question has been an integral part of our school's community for many years. It has provided a platform for students to come together, share their interests, and develop new skills. More importantly, it has served as a safe space for students who feel marginalized or left out of mainstream activities.  I understand that the decision to disband the club may have been made due to financial or logistical reasons. However, I believe that the benefits of keeping the club far outweigh any challenges that it may pose. By disbanding this club, you are taking away a vital resource for students who need it the most. You are also depriving the school of a vibrant community that has contributed positively to our campus culture.  Furthermore, the club has been successful in achieving its goals and has made significant contributions to our school. For example, the club has organized several events that have raised awareness about important social issues and have even raised funds for various charitable causes. The club has also been responsible for initiating several projects that have had a positive impact on the school community.  In conclusion, I urge you to reconsider the decision to disband the club. The benefits of keeping the club far outweigh any challenges that it may pose. By disbanding the club, you are depriving students of a vital resource and taking away a vibrant community that has contributed positively to our campus culture.

" If I were to choose one professional to travel aboard the next space station, I would select a scientist. Scientists have a unique skill set that could be extremely valuable in space exploration. They have the ability to analyze and interpret data, problem-solve, and conduct experiments to further our understanding of the universe.  For example, a scientist could study the effects of long-term space travel on the human body, investigate the possibility of extraterrestrial life, or conduct experiments on materials and technologies that could be used in space exploration.  Additionally, scientists are trained to work methodically and meticulously, which is essential in the often high-risk and complex environment of space exploration. They can also work collaboratively with other astronauts and professionals from different fields to achieve a common goal.  Overall, I believe that sending a scientist to the next space station would be a wise choice, as they could contribute greatly to our understanding of the universe and help us advance our capabilities in space exploration.

" In recent years, the United States has been perceived by some as a nation of ""couch potatoes."" This stereotype is not without basis, as many Americans lead sedentary lifestyles that involve a lot of sitting and minimal physical activity. However, this lack of activity has significant consequences for our health and well-being. In this essay, I will make a case for why it is important to be physically active and encourage readers to incorporate more movement into their daily lives.  To begin with, physical activity is essential for maintaining good health. Regular exercise has been shown to reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and certain types of cancer. It can also improve overall health by helping to manage weight, reducing the risk of osteoporosis, and improving mental health. Being physically active can also increase energy levels, improve sleep quality, and reduce stress levels.  Beyond the health benefits, physical activity can also be an enjoyable and social experience. Exercise can be a great way to meet new people and make friends. Participating in team sports, joining a fitness class, or taking a dance lesson can all be great opportunities to connect with others who share similar interests. Additionally, exercise can be a great way to enjoy nature and explore new places. Going for a hike, a bike ride, or a swim in the ocean can all be fun and rewarding experiences.  However, despite these benefits, many Americans struggle to incorporate physical activity into their daily lives. One reason for this is the perception that exercise has to be time-consuming and intense. In reality, even small amounts of activity can have significant health benefits. Walking for just 30 minutes a day can help reduce the risk of chronic diseases and improve overall health. Additionally, there are many ways to incorporate movement into your daily routine, such as taking the stairs instead of the elevator or doing some light stretching during a break at work.  Another obstacle to physical activity is the belief that it has to be expensive. While gym memberships and fitness classes can be costly, there are many ways to be active that don't require a lot of money. Going for a run or a walk outside is free, and there are many free resources available online that offer workouts and exercise routines that can be done at home with minimal equipment.  In conclusion, physical activity is essential for maintaining good health and well-being. Despite the stereotype of the ""couch potato,"" there are many ways to be physically active that are enjoyable, social, and accessible. By incorporating movement into our daily lives, we can improve our health, connect with others, and enjoy all the benefits that come with an active lifestyle. So let's get up, get moving, and start living our best lives!                ",1

" I can try to generate an essay example for you based on the search results. Here is what I came up with:  A Change of Plans  Life is full of surprises and sometimes things do not go according to our plans. We may have to face unexpected challenges or opportunities that require us to adapt and change our course of action. In this essay, I will describe a situation where a change of plans became necessary and how I dealt with it.  Last year, I had planned to go on a vacation with my family to Hawaii. We had booked our flights and hotel months in advance and were looking forward to enjoying the sun, sand and sea. However, a week before our departure date, we received some bad news. My grandfather, who lived in another state, had suffered a stroke and was hospitalized. He was in critical condition and the doctors were not sure if he would survive.  My family and I were shocked and saddened by this news. We decided to cancel our vacation and fly to see my grandfather instead. We had to pay a lot of fees for changing our flights and hotel reservations, but we did not care about the money. We just wanted to be with him and support him.  We arrived at the hospital and saw my grandfather lying on a bed with tubes and wires attached to him. He looked pale and weak, but he recognized us and smiled faintly. We hugged him and told him how much we loved him. He could not speak much, but he squeezed our hands and nodded. We stayed with him for a few days, talking to him, reading to him, praying for him.  On the third day, we received some good news. The doctors said that my grandfather had shown some signs of improvement and that he might recover. They said that he would need a lot of rehabilitation and care, but he had a chance to live a normal life again. We were overjoyed and thanked them for their efforts.  We decided to stay with my grandfather for another week until he was stable enough to be transferred to a rehabilitation center. We helped him with his exercises, fed him, bathed him, cheered him up. He gradually regained some of his strength and speech. He thanked us for being there for him and said that we were his angels.  We finally returned home after two weeks of being away. We missed our vacation, but we did not regret our decision. We were glad that we could be with my grandfather when he needed us most. We learned that family is more important than anything else and that we should cherish every moment we have with them.  We also learned that life is unpredictable and that we should be flexible and adaptable when things change. We realized that sometimes a change of plans can be a blessing in disguise and lead us to something better than what we had planned.   ",1
"Oh my sweet little cat, how I love thee,
With your soft fur and tiny paws,
You make my heart sing with glee.

From the moment we met,
You captured my heart,
With your playful ways,
And your gentle, loving art.

Your purrs soothe my soul,
Your eyes light up my day,
And your little mews,
Are like music that I play.

You curl up in my lap,
And I stroke your silky hair,
And in those moments,
I know how much you care.

So my little cat, my friend,
Thank you for all you give,
For being my faithful companion,
And for showing me how to live.",1
"So I'm not sure on what I'm supposed to be typing about. What I smell, taste, feel like??? Well I'm chewing gum. I've been chewing it for over like 3 hours now. I hate it when gum starts to get really hard in your mouth. My gum got hard a long time ago. But somehow the flavor is still intact. It's weird though- like with some gum, the flavor is gone after you chew it for like literally 2 minutes. However, I've noticed that Wrigley's chewing gum tends to have flavor for a very long time. There are many pictures on my wall. I stuck all these pics up like 2 days ago. There are pictures of my friends, one of my dog, and one of me and my sis. I don't have one of my family up there. I kind of feel bad in a way. But I don't think it's necessary to have them up on the board. I have a picture of them in my drawer if I ever need to see them. But I think it's better with them in my drawer. Every time I look up at these pictures of all my friends, I miss them like no other. Man, I had so much fun last year, in high school in general. But last year was definitely the best year. Man, me, Caroline, and Shaheen in government and Spanish. Those were some good times. I kind of even miss my teachers. And our elephants and doing SCN all the time. We have so many inside jokes. And although I'm sure I'll see Caroline again, I'm afraid that when I meet her things won't be the same. And for some reason I'm scared of that. I hope I can go to LSU in the spring. Or actually, I hope Caroline can come to Houston for Thanksgiving. Or both would be the best. And we can't forget about going to Europe next summer. I'm so used to traveling with friends because we always went on vacation with Xerx and Zahra. But now with this whole separation thing, I know that our traveling days with the Tegra family are over. Those were some fun trips too. I feel so blessed to have a friend like Xerx. And even Zubin and stuff. People that I've known my whole life. That even know I don't see them too often, when I do, you can tell that there's something there. Like I feel so close to them cause I practically grew up with them and their parents are like my parents. It's a really nice feeling. I'm also blessed for Shenz and the whole family. God, Shenz and Fred really do care about me and Tash like we were their own kids. And just knowing that really means a lot to me. And I hope that mom feels the same way about Zareen cause that would only be fair. So we're talking about fairness in my freshman seminar class and I'm thinking that maybe this class isn't going to be that easy after all. But I love the Professor; we call him Dr. EO. Hahaha, he's really cool. Like I walk into his class and he's like ""do you want a drink?"" Wow, I was like thinking ""what is this?"" Oh, and his classroom is in his office which have weird scary looking statues of people's heads. The office kind of reminds me of the The Vinci Code. I don't know why, maybe the whole ""Louvre"" idea. I always say I hate France and stuff but I really don't. I just think it's kind of funny to say that. But I really don't know why it's funny. But I mean I've said it so many times now that I really think I've instilled the idea into my head. Like I really don't want to travel to France in the summer. But I mean if Caroline wants to, then I really don't care. I think I'm pretty easy going when it comes to life. Like about my grades- I mean if I don't so well in college, what's going to happen to me? I mean, I'm still going to get a job and all, hopefully get into a good grad school. But I mean if for whatever reason I don't, then I think I'll be ok. I mean, it's not like I'm going to die or anything. Plus, if I have my own family then I don't think I'll be able to work and have the kids and stuff. Man, it's a complicated issue. We got a phone in our room, the same one I had in my room at home. But I haven't used it once here. If anything, Jennifer has used it way more than me. Man, I haven't even given anyone the number to this phone cause I don't want them calling in case they call when I'm not here and then have to talk to Jennifer. I'm not sure what I'm more afraid of, them talking to Jennifer or Jennifer talking to them. No, but Jennifer's really cool. But so is Joanna's roommate. Man, I wish I had a roommate like her. Dude, me and Jennifer need to start hanging out more often. But I never want us to have the same friends. John is one of Jennifer's friends. Majoring in Japanese and stuff. Wow, that's cool, especially since he's white and all. I've always wanted to take some random language like Japanese. I don't know, it's like you gain more respect if you fluently learn a language that is so not from where you are. Like me learning a African language and spe",0
"V391 Pegasi b, also known as HS 2201+2610 b, is an extrasolar planet candidate orbiting the star V391 Pegasi approximately 4,570 light-years away in the constellation of Pegasus. The candidate planet was discovered by means of variable star timing, which measured anomalies in variability of the star caused by a planet. It is the first planet candidate to claim to be detected with this method. The discovery reported the planet candidate to have mass of 3.2 times Jupiter's (assuming an edge-on orbit), semi-major axis of 1.7 AU, and orbital period of 1,170 days. The planet candidate was discovered in March 2007 and published in September 2007. If it is confirmed, its survival would indicate that planets at Earth-like distances can survive their star's red-giant phase, though this is a much larger planet than Earth (about the same size as Jupiter and Saturn). Its existence has been called into question with further monitoring of the pulsations of the star which show deviations from the predicted behavior if this were in fact a planet. The variations in the pulsations may be due to unknown stellar variability.",0
"I am tired today. I should have gone to bed earlier. I need to study. How much do I need to read for my classes to get A's in them? I have to do my economics homework today. I miss home I miss my family. I have never been away from home for this long. I won't get to see my parents till parents weekend but that will be really nice. I have a fraternity meeting at 6:30. I can't wait until the next football game, the game this past weekend was awesome. I need to wear a hat at the next game cause I got a bad sunburn last weekend. My face hurts from the sunburn still. I wonder when our next fraternity mixer will be. A picture reminds me of my Europe trip last summer. It was one of the best experiences I have ever had. I have a paranoid feeling that I am not doing enough work or studying, that I am neglecting something. I hate doing laundry, I have already had to do it twice since I've been in Austin. It hasn't rained since I've been here, I wonder when it will rain. I hate the heat and humidity in Austin. I can't wait till it cools down and turns into fall. The girl in my business administration class yesterday was very pretty, maybe I can go on a date with her sometime this semester. Viacom merged with CBS, maybe CBS won't be such a lousy network anymore. I need to eat lunch soon. I hope I am doing this assignment right.

"In micro-sociology, interactionism is a theoretical perspective that emphasizes the role of social interaction in human behaviour. It is a philosophical and methodological approach that began to develop in the 1940s and 1950s and has been influential in sociology, anthropology, and psychology.  Interactionism is a theoretical perspective that emphasizes the role of social interaction in human behaviour. It is a philosophical and methodological approach that began to develop in the 1940s and 1950s and has been influential in sociology, anthropology, and psychology. The basic idea is that humans are not just individual actors but are also members of social groups, which shapes their behaviour. Social interaction is thus seen as a key factor in understanding human behaviour.  Interactionism has a number of important implications for sociology. First, it emphasises the role of social norms and values in shaping behaviour.Second, it emphasises the importance of contextuality in understanding human behaviour. Finally, it stresses the importance of social interaction as a means of learning and understanding behaviour.  Interactionism has also had an important impact on the methodology of sociology. It has led to the development of social process theory and action research, two important methodological approaches within sociology.",1

"As the sun rises in the east,
And nature awakens from its slumber,
A symphony better than any feast,
Melodies of the morning sun.

The gentle breeze, the rustling leaves,
The chirping birds in the trees,
The buzzing bees around the hive,
Melodies of the morning sun.

The flowing streams, the gushing waterfalls,
The blooming flowers, the pastoral scenes,
The grazing cattle, the farmers’ calls,
Melodies of the morning sun.

The golden rays, the vibrant hues,
The fresh aroma, the cleansing dew,
The beginning of a brand new day,
Melodies of the morning sun.

Let us bask in the beauty of it all,
And give thanks for this wondrous world,
And join the chorus of creatures great and small,
Melodies of the morning sun.",1
"Measure two handfuls for a prosperous man.
Place in pot and wash by rubbing palms together
as if you can’t quite get yourself to pray, or
by squeezing it in one fist. Wash
several times to get rid of the cloudy water;
when you are too high in Heaven, looking down
at the clouds, you can’t see what’s precious below.
Rinse with cold water and keep enough so that
it will barely cover your hand placed on the rice.
Don’t use hot water, there are metallic diseases
colliding in it. This method of measuring water will work
regardless of the size of the pot; if the pot is large,
use both hands palms down as if to pat your own belly.
Now place on high heat without cover and cook
until the water has been boiled away except in craters
resembling those of the moon, important
in ancient times for growing rice. Now place lid on top
and reduce heat to medium, go read your newspaper
until you get to the comics, then come back and turn it down to low.
The heat has been gradually traveling from the outside
to the inside of the rice, giving it texture;
a similar thing happens with people, I suppose.
Go back to your newspaper, finish the comics, and read
the financial page. Now the rice is done, but before
you eat, consider the peasant who arcs in leech-infested
paddies and who carefully plants the rice seedlings
one by one; on this night, you are eating better than he.
If you still don’t know how to cook rice, buy a Japanese
automatic rice cooker; it makes perfect rice every time!",0

It calls out to me like a wave, 
It's sweetness and richness, 
So pure and true, 
Brings me joy and all anew. 

It's the feeling on my tongue, 
As I delve into my rum, 
The sweetness of sugary treats, 
A moment of pure bliss it greets. 

The taste of the ocean's salty bite, 
As the breeze caresses the night, 
A simple pleasure that I adore, 
A connection to the earth's core. 

The tang of a perfectly ripe fruit, 
Makes my heart sing and jump to boot, 
Its juicy flesh drips with glee, 
A moment of pure ecstasy. 

So as I take a bite and savor its taste, 
I forget my worries and my haste. 
The taste I crave, a moment of pause, 
A reminder to live life with true cause.",1
" There are many ways to save money and still cover your basic needs. Here are some suggestions:  Create a budget: Start by listing all of your expenses and income for the month. Then, prioritize your basic needs such as rent, utilities, food, and transportation. Allocate your remaining funds towards other expenses like entertainment or shopping. Stick to this budget strictly.  Cook at home: Eating out can be expensive. By preparing meals at home, you can save a lot of money. Buy groceries in bulk and cook in batches to save time and money.  Reduce utility bills: Unplug unused appliances, turn off lights and adjust the thermostat. These small changes can significantly reduce your utility bills.  Shop smart: Buy generic brands and shop at discount stores. Purchase only the things that you need and avoid impulse buys.  Use public transportation: Take public transportation instead of owning a car. It’s cheaper and can save you money on gas, maintenance, and insurance.  Reduce unnecessary expenses: Eliminate subscriptions you don’t use, cancel memberships, and avoid expensive hobbies or vacations.  Find ways to earn extra money: Consider taking up a side hustle or selling unused items online. Use the extra money to cover unexpected expenses or put it towards savings.  By implementing these strategies, you can save money while still covering your basic needs. It takes discipline and consistency, but the rewards can be significant.     ",1

"Ok well here I am sitting in my dorm room trying to finish this assignment. Earlier today I had called the student financial aid services because all of my financial aid hasn't come through yet. But now they said it should be getting here anytime soon. And one more thing I still need to do is go get a book for my government class because earlier in the week, they had said that it had been ordered although it wasn't there yet. So I'm probably going to have to go later on today. Then my roommate is going to the football game tomorrow morning. I still don't have a sports package and I didn't buy a ticket so this time I won't be seeing the game. I have a paper due for government on monday concerning my political views and where I come from and who or what has influenced me to think that way. I'm still unsure as to what exactly I will be saying. I just have a couple of ideas written down in a piece of paper. Oh man, yesterday some friends and I went to go work out and for some reason my legs are kind of sore right now. We're probably going again today, but who knows. I'm starting to get a little hungry now, I ate breakfast this morning but I'm getting hungry again. Oh I almost forgot, today is my friend's birthday, I need to call him after I finish this assignment. He is back at my hometown, El Paso, but I'm still calling him to wish him a happy birthday.

And then other people down the hall complain that it's too hot in their room. I don't know but whatever. My board here in the room looks kinda plain right now. I was initially going to put up some posters a while back, but I ended up doing other stuff and then I would get lazy, so till now the board still looks bare. All I have is one poster on one of the walls here to my right. And then the curtains we put up kept falling at the beginning but we finally got them to stay. All I need now is to actually get the other pictures I wanted to put up already. Oh and then there's my calendar on the wall too, but that's about it. I'm definitely going to finish that this weekend. Last night our neighbors were making a lot of noise and I just couldn't fall asleep. Soon enough I did though. And then I had to wake up early because I have an eight o' clock class, but I managed to do it. So now I'm just here waiting for my roommate to get back from work because we need to go to the store and I need to get a book. Then she said she wanted to buy some jersey for the game on saturday. While I'll be sleeping in, she will be at the game. she can later tell me how the game went, because last time it was raining, hopefully it won't rain again. Now I'm a bit thirsty, I think I'm going to go get myself something to drink from downstairs. Ok that was all for my 20 minutes. finished.",0

" However, I can present some information and arguments that can help you formulate your own opinion on whether all students should be required to learn a foreign language before graduating from high school.  Learning a foreign language has many benefits, both practical and cultural. In practical terms, knowing a second language can increase job opportunities and salary potential, especially in fields such as business, diplomacy, and tourism. Additionally, learning a foreign language can enhance cognitive abilities such as memory, problem-solving, and multitasking. On a cultural level, knowing a foreign language can help promote understanding and appreciation of other cultures, leading to increased tolerance and diversity.  On the other hand, requiring all students to learn a foreign language may have some drawbacks. Some students may not have the aptitude or interest in learning a foreign language, and forcing them to do so could cause unnecessary stress and frustration. Additionally, the resources required to provide quality foreign language instruction to all students may not be available in some schools, leading to unequal access to education.  In summary, the decision of whether all students should be required to learn a foreign language before graduating from high school is complex and multifaceted. While there are clear benefits to learning a foreign language, it may not be appropriate or feasible for all students. Ultimately, the decision should be made based on the individual needs and goals of each student, as well as the resources and priorities of each school and community.        ",1

"Dreams - a world beyond our own  
A place where possibilities are grown  
A realm where imagination roams so free  
And we can be whoever we want to be  
  
In dreams, we can soar through the sky  
Or swim with dolphins, way up high  
We can talk to lions or fly with birds  
And roam through vast lands, without any words  
  
Our dreams can be sweet, or they can be strange  
And leave us feelings that we can't derange  
They can inspire, or fill us with fear  
And leave us longing, for when they reappear  
  
But what makes dreams so magical and true  
Is that they're reflections of what we pursue  
They show us our passions, our yearning desires  
And ignite our souls like smoldering fires  
  
So embrace the dreams that come to you at night  
For they're a gift, like a glimmer of light  
And they'll take you on journeys, you've never seen  
To a world that's forever, wild and serene.",1
"A moment cherished in my heart so deep,
Comes to me when I'm in my sleep.
A special time, oh so sweet,
A memory that cannot be beat.

A walk along a sandy shore,
With someone special, whom I adore.
The sunset painted orange and red,
And I felt so alive, not dead.

The salty breeze blew in my hair,
As we walked without a care.
Talking, laughing, holding hands,
We walked along the endless sands.

I stopped and turned, took a look,
A memory forever in my book.
The sun was setting, oh so slow,
That moment will forever glow.

The kiss that followed sealed the deal,
A moment that I'll always feel.
My cherished memory, forever mine,
The moment when that sun did shine.",1

"right now I feel somewhat relaxed after having seen one of the most gory movies of all-time. The title of the movie is Event Horizon in which a ship is taken over by evil spirits which have been taken onboard through a dimension warp. My brain feels completely clouded over because I don't really want to start school. I also want to bet on football pretty badly. This past weekend I lost a pretty nice piece of change while none of my teams covered the spread. I hope to do much better this weekend, but it has me worried.     My toe also seems to be giving me trouble because it got infected about one year ago but it never seems to get all the way healed. Maybe there is a chance that it will give me problems for the rest of my life. I'm pretty tired right now since it is 1:15 in the morning. I feel I have had a productive day though because I went to class today and got meaningful information from them. Especially in this class. I usually have no sort of interest in scientific things like the brain but the lecture seemed really interesting. I liked the explanations that were given from several things in everyday life. It has also just hit me that Mr. pennebaker said he was from midland, which is also my hometown. I think its a pretty good place, you just have to have a little imagination that's all. I'm thinking that since I ran so much this evening my back might actually be sore because of it. Hell, I dont know though. I could use a nice woman in my life right now, but I am extremely picky unless I've been boozing it a little. It is cold somewhat in my room right now and there are many things that I must take of before tomorrow. I need to do some laundry and do some reading for class. I get extremely irritated when things don't operate smoothly. I wish I knew more about computers so that I could take care of my email problem. A nice cheeseburger would be excellent right now but I dont really want one do to the fact that I'm trying to lose a few lbs. Im debating whether or not to turn the TV on and watch a movie or just go straight to bed. Last night I almost got in a fight with one of my pledge brothers and to tell you the truth. I think the guy knows I could have killed him because he is not crazy enough to take me. I'm really not in a position            do some work for a good cause. I need a damn job so I can get some money to pay off some debts and be in good standing with my parents. One thing I've noticed recently is that everyone talks bad about people behind their backs. I mean I've sat down and talked bad about probably everyone I know. People pick out one person's weakness or what they consider to be a weakness and bash them pretty good when they arent around. I know people say stuff about me when my back is turned but hey so did i. I figure its nothing to think about to seriously unless someone is spreading lies. That is bullshit. I've been writing now for 22 minutes Ill stop. is there any that I could",0
"Well, I'm in my dorm room right now and I just finished playing a computer game called WarCraft 3. It's a very addicting game and I think I play it too much. I should be doing more important stuff like studying, or I could read a book or something like that. I'm feeling pretty happy because today I really don't have any more classes to go to, but I know I have homework to do. I also have to go reset my business passwordfor my email account at the Millenium Lab. Even though I'm feeling fine right now, overall I feel pretty overwhelmed with me in college and all. I also have other stuff on my mind which worries me. Stuff that deals with my family and friends. I think I left a lot of loose ends back home in Houston. I really want to tie up those loose ends though. That's one thing about me I like; I may not finish doing something or procrastinate a lot, but I always end up finishing a job, which I think is very important. If you start something you have to finish it or at least that's how I feel. I'm listening to music on MTV now and I love listening to music. I would'nt feel comfortable if there was not some kind of noise happening in here. I don't like it when it's silent for some reason. I prefer when the TV is on, or someone is talking to me. For some people, relaxing means laying down in silence. For me, it's listening to my favorite songs. And I like all kinds of songs. Rock, Rap, Hip-Hop, Alternative, Classic Rock, and even some country and classical. I'm pretty well-rounded in my musical tastes. I think that reflects me as a person also. I am  very accepting of all types of personal tastes that others may have. I like that about myself also. I wonder how my parents are feeling about me being gone. I hate to admit it but I really do miss them. I also miss my sisters and playing with their kids. My niece and nephew's are so much fun to play with. I wish they were right here with me right now. I would love to show them the campus. I feel really bad about my dad having to pay so much money for me to get my education here. I want to help out more. I hate it when my parents have to put up money for me. I usually try to stay independant of the them when it comes to cash. I need to get a job soon to help out money-wise. It will be hard juggling school and a job, but I did it in high school. I know college is different than high school, but it's something I have to do. It will make me feel better. I've liked my time here at UT so far though. This is a really neat place. I mentioned before that I feel overwhelmed, but I'm trying to not make it stress me out. I'm pretty good at keeping my stress level low. Most people stress about little things, and that's not good for you. I'm hoping that I get good grades and I'm really going to try to do my best here and not just play around. Tomorrow is the September 11th anniversary (1 year). I see stuff about it all the time on TV. That event really made me feel patriotic and made me very very proud to be an American. It got me mad that people would do that. In fact it got me really mad. I wanted to do something and thoughts about joining the army came into my mind but I never really took that seriously. Instead I went to go donate blood. I figured I would try to help out any way I could. But all in all, I'm proud to be living in the greatest country in the world. I'm going to try and go to the ceromony on the south lawn. I hope it will be meaningful. Basically I have lots of emotions running through me, but the trick is to balance them as evenly as possible.",0

"Little green involute fronds of fern at creekside.
And the sinewy clear water rushing over creekstone
of the palest amber, veined with a darker gold,
thinnest lines of gold rivering through the amber
like—ah, now we come to it. We were not put on earth,
the old man said, he was hacking into the crust
of a sourdough half loaf in his vehement, impatient way
with an old horn-handled knife, to express ourselves.
I knew he had seen whole cities leveled: also
that there had been a time of shame for him, outskirts
of a ruined town, half Baroque, half Greek Revival,
pediments of Flora and Hygeia from a brief eighteenth-century
health spa boom lying on the streets in broken chunks
and dogs scavenging among them. His one act of courage
then had been to drop pieces of bread or chocolate,
as others did, where a fugitive family of Jews
was rumored to be hiding. I never raised my voice,
of course, none of us did.",0
"So yesterday my boyfriend from A&M came down to Austin to celebrate our 9 month anniversary. It was a lot of fun but I stayed up late so I'm pretty tired. I hate that feeling of no energy and I just want to sleep but I know I can't because I am so stressed out. I am still really adjusting to college life. It's is so different from high school and its not all that it's worked up to be. I really like all the freedom, along with everyone else, but I am finding out that its hard to keep up on my studying. I am only taking 14 hrs. , which is supposedly and easy load, but I feel so bogged down. I tell myself I am go into catch up on the weekend and it never happens because other things come up. I have so much I want to do but there are not enough hours in the day. But everyone says this is what a lot of college students feel like and it will take time for me to adjust. I just don't hope it will reflect in my grades. I thought I had a calculus test next Friday, but I came to find out today that it is nest Wednesday. That is really scary. Bit I took calculus my senior year in high school so I feel I know some of the stuff. Everyone studies hardcore for tests, which I am pretty nervous about. I don't really do to much homework in that class because I have so much to do in my other classes. I really hope I'm doing the right thing on this paper and that every other student doesn't type super fast so my paper looks really short and that I didn't try. Anyways, I have a problem with the nest football game which is TX vs. Rice. I didn't realize they sold the tickets so early. I guess the draw started yesterday. I want to go but I haven't really met a lot of close friends to go with. This guy friend from high school wants me to go but I really want to go with a big group of people. I have never been to a large football game. Actually the only games I have gone to have been my high school games. But my high school had like 3,000 people so it was a big school. A lot of the seniors from our school went to A&M because it's only an hour away. I don't know why they would want to go and pass up living in the city like this. I am originally from California, which was so pretty, and Houston isn't the prettiest place in the world. I forgot so sign off instant messenger and people are trying to talk to me. It is getting really annoying. Seems like that is a such a popular way to communicate with people now. I like it but some people are obsessed with it. But I guess I am obsessed with my cell phone. I don't even use any other phone. I am always on it. I think it is so funny when you walk to class and everyone is on  their cells. I feel like I have to take mine to and call someone so of course I do. Plus, walking to class gets kind of lonely. I feel like these thoughts pop in my head and I then I go in a tangent to try to type. But then my mind goes blank for a second. I never really thought I was a good writer. In fact, I thought I was horrible. My teachers never gave me feedback and I never felt comfortable sharing my papers in class. It wasn't until the end of my senior year, my English teacher told the whole class that I was one of the best writers in the class. I really thank her for that because that really boosted my confidence and I feel like I do write well. It almost makes me look forward to writing instead of procrastinating like I do everything else. My critical thinking teacher said that is the number one regret for students after their first semester. I believe him because it is so hard not to procrastinate. I try not to since it's such a bad thing, but I guess it's just human nature.",0
"Geneviève-Aimé-Zoë Prévost (15 April 1802, Paris – 10 April 1861, Paris) was a French operatic soprano. She created leading roles in some of the most notable French opéras comiques of the first half of the nineteenth century, including ""Fra Diavolo"" by Daniel Auber and ""Le postillon de Lonjumeau"" by Adolphe Adam. Career Geneviève-Aimé-Zoë Prévost, also known as Zoé Prévost, had a younger brother, Eugene, who was a composer and conductor. Zoé studied singing at the Paris Conservatoire and made her debut at the Opéra-Comique, Paris, in 1821. The Opéra-Comique at that time presented operas light in tone and with spoken dialogue between the musical numbers. She created leading roles in many opéras comiques including  the title role in ""La marquise de Brinvilliers"", a collaborative work between nine composers, and in works by Fromental Halévy, Ambroise Thomas, and others. Considered one of the major stars of the lyric stage of her day, Prévost was esteemed for her  unaffected stage presence, her charm of person and manner, her skills as a comic actress, and her excellent singing technique. She created the leading soprano roles in two opéras comiques still performed today, Zerlina in ""Fra Diavolo"" by Auber in 1830 and Madeleine in ""Le postillon de Lonjumeau"" by Adam in 1836, the most successful works of those two composers. In the latter work, as in others, she appeared opposite her husband, leading tenor Jean-Baptiste Chollet, by whom she had one daughter, Caroline, who also achieved success as a singer under the stage name Mademoiselle Monrose. Geneviève-Aimé-Zoë Prévost also appeared in other French and Belgian opera houses.",0
"Willie King (March 18, 1943 – March 8, 2009) was an American blues guitarist and singer, known for shunning fame and playing at a local bar in Mississippi. Biography King was born in Prairie Point, a community in Noxubee County, Mississippi near the Alabama border. Prior to recording, he worked as a sharecropper, moonshine maker and traveling salesman; just a few of his many occupations. Later he became active with the civil rights movement, which inspired him to write socially conscious blues songs. In 1983, he founded the Rural Members Association, a non-profit organization dedicated to promoting the traditional rural skills King had grown up with, which he called 'survival skills,' and helping improve his local community.  In 1997, the Rural Members Association started the annual Freedom Creek blues festival, which has since received international recognition. He began recording in 1999 and his 2000 recordings Freedom Creek and I Am The Blues, were the first of several acclaimed albums.",0

"Well writing really isn't my best ior favorite thing to do but i guess it doesn't matter when you are paying to take your classe huh??? anyway when i write i seem to easily get destracted and then it just makes the time go by alot slower whicch in turn makes it really boring. Well that is why i don't like writtin and when i first heard that we were going to have to do it for twenty minutes i felt sick to my stomach. well enough of that next. . . Lets see. . are you sure that this is confidential,  well if it is then i guess it is ok, i mean this is UT (the greatest school in the world),me and my girlfriend have our anniversary tonight, we have been together for two years as of today. that is the longest that i have ever been with someone, i guess i can talk about my girlfriend because she is the only thing that i can talk about for 20 minutes,  or at least i hope that i can. well in june of 2000 this girl called me and asked how i was. ididn't recognize her voice so i was trying to play it off until she gave me a clue as to who she was. Then she asked how my summer was going and i said fine and asked her the same thing. Then she asked me if i was running like coach told us to do over the summer, so then i knew that she was a track girl. I then could eliminate quite a few considdering that most of the track girls were gorgeuos(&lt;--spelling) and probably wouldn't have anything to do with me. You see i have alot of piopular friend, i mean played football and ran track for 6 years all the way from seventh grade to my senior year. Now i was never REALLY good at either one but i could hold my own, but i guess since i wasn't one of the star ath;etes that i was not very popular in turn myself. So, bvack to the story which hopfully makes this writing alot easier. So i had narrowed it down to about five and then she told me that she got my number from her yearbook that i signed, and i onlyremember signing one girls yearbook on the track team. So i gave it a shot aand asked her   so what about you Rebecca are you running?    she answered yes and then i knew thatr it was her. Now Rebecca is just like me very athletic and have alot of friends that are popular but we are not popular our-selves. so we talked for a while and then i had to go because i was going to eat dinner. so she called me a couple of days later and saying that her and her b/f weren't getting along becase he was in corpus cristi at a tennis camp ((what a geeeeeeeeeeek)  but i guess that i am a geek also)and would never talk to her. so, to make a long story short, they broke up and then on september 12, 2000 is when we officially started to be together and here we are today the rest is just history but honestly i am not the type of guy who thinks about love at first sight and knowing that you want to spend the rest of your liofe with someone but i reall do love her and i can't really see myself without her and she has told me the same. Man is thing almost ove, oh it is well thanks for listining",0

" The proverb ""Better a lie that soothes than a truth that hurts"" suggests that it is preferable to be comforted by a falsehood rather than being hurt by the truth. While this statement may seem to offer temporary relief, I don't agree with this proverb.  In the long run, it is always better to confront the truth, even if it may be painful initially. Facing reality and accepting the truth allows us to understand and address problems properly. Ignoring the truth or living in a world of illusions can lead to negative consequences. In some situations, choosing to believe a lie can have serious consequences, such as financial losses or even physical harm.  For example, let's say someone's friend is addicted to drugs, but they keep denying their addiction. If the friend tells them a lie that their behavior is normal or acceptable, it might temporarily make them feel better, but it doesn't solve the problem. Eventually, the truth will come out, and the situation will be much worse than if the friend had been honest from the beginning.  Another example is in a business context. If a company's financial reports are inaccurate, but the CEO chooses to ignore the truth and present them as positive to investors, it can have catastrophic consequences in the long run.  In conclusion, the proverb ""Better a lie that soothes than a truth that hurts"" may provide temporary relief, but it is not a wise or sustainable way to deal with problems. It is better to face the truth, no matter how uncomfortable it may be, and work towards finding a solution.               ",1

" I can suggest a possible item to be placed in a time capsule for future generations based on its cultural significance and representation of the 21st century.  One item that I believe embodies the culture of the early 21st century is the smartphone. Smartphones have revolutionized the way people communicate, access information, and interact with the world. They are an indispensable part of modern life, and their impact is felt in almost every aspect of society.  Smartphones have changed the way people interact with one another, allowing people to communicate instantaneously across vast distances through messaging apps, social media, and video calls. They have also transformed the way we access information, making it possible to quickly and easily look up any question or query on the internet.  Furthermore, smartphones have also revolutionized the way people consume media, allowing them to stream movies, TV shows, and music on-demand. They have also created new forms of entertainment, such as mobile gaming and social media challenges.  Overall, the smartphone represents the pinnacle of technological advancement in the 21st century. It embodies the culture of the era, where people are increasingly connected to one another and the world around them, and where information is readily accessible at all times. It would be fitting to place a smartphone in a time capsule for future generations to understand the cultural significance and technological advancements of the early 21st century.       ",1

"Summer, the season of endless light
When everything feels just right
The sun shines bright and the sky is clear
Birds sing and nature appears

The days stretch long with time to spare
We feel free without a care
School’s out and work takes a break
Outdoor adventures we undertake

The oceans and lakes call our name
Beaches filled with laughter and games
We swim, we surf, we bask in the sun
This season of excitement has just begun

Ice cream cones and BBQs galore
Friends and family, we adore
Picnics under shady trees
A perfect time to relax and breeze

The world seems full of endless possibilities
When summer comes, we embrace its abilities
The season of growth and renewal
Filled with warmth and joy, no one can refuse it's fuel

So let us enjoy the moments that summer brings
And cherish the memories that make our hearts sing
Embrace the magic of this wonderful time
Oh, sweet summer, we're yours, every day is just divine.",1

We have to do a lot of demolition, and to help us out the fire department said they had some guys to train to breech walls. So for the last week they have been breaking through walls. It has been really cool to watch. My coffee smells really good. I am listening to some Audio Adrenaline. They are a Christian band I just downloaded. They sound pretty good, nothing that great about them though. I am switching majors this semester from Engineering to a dual major in History and Spanish, pretty drastic transfer huh?  I think it will be good. I got accepted into the UTeach program and so starting this semester I will be in an Austin public school teaching and observing. I will be in the classroom starting next week. I am very excited. My arms are getting really tired from writing so much and it has only been six minutes. I think they are going to fall off. I have a lot to do today. Since I am not working it will give me a good opportunity to catch up. I think I will be pretty far behind in this class PSY 301 because the Co-OP does not have the book(it is out of stock) They won't have it until Monday the 8th. I'll just have to read a lot next week. I need to do laundry today and maybe clean my truck. I am trying to sell my truck. It is a big beast and gets horrible gas mileage. About 10 miles per gallon. I think I will put it on Auto trader and see what I can get for it there. My coffee is done and it is calling my name. Come. Drink me. ""   I guess I will just have to wait another. oh my gosh. 10 minutes. I am losing my thoughts because my arms hurt so bad and I am really tired. I have to read six books for my History class. It's not so bad I have alreay read one of them and have started on another. The first was very boring. I think the rest will get better. This is a good song. I am also taking Chem 302 I think it will be a challenge because I don't really remember Chem 301 that well. I kind of breezed through it and didn't really learn any of the material. What other classes do I have?. I am trying to teach myself Spanish right now. It is fun. I think I can use Spanish a lot later in life. I hope to do some missionary work and maybe go into youth/college ministry. But who knows what the big guy has in store for me. College age has a lot of possibilities. I am hoping to maybe get something started this semester. I don't know how that is going to turn out but I think it will be fun. THis last summer me and a couple of friends went to Colorado did some fly fishing, landscape photography, and climbed Mt. Elbert (which is the highest peak in the Rockies @ 14,433)  It was a lot of fun. I and looking at a picture of me and my friend Chris. It is of when we went skydiving last year. That was a whole lot of fun. ""People may doubt what you say, but they will always believe what you do"". Reads a poster on my wall. I read it every day to help my fully realize how much more my actions speak than my words. I would like to be a great orator but if somebody could only know my through my life practices and not my life speeches I would want them to say that I had a heart like David "". a man after God's own heart. ""  That would be the testimony of my life. I pray that I can life according to the beliefs in which I so strongly hold. K2, Everest, Anapurna  some of the greatest peaks in the world. I someday wish to climb all of them. But we will see how things play themselves out. I think it is so funny how people grunt and groan and try to figure it all out. The things that are above. are always going to be greater than those below. And tru faith means you don't have to have all the answers. The End",0
"Igumnov House  is a historic house in Moscow, currently used as the residence of the French Ambassador to Russia. The house is located at 43 Bolshaya Yakimanka Street  in the Yakimanka District of Moscow. The building  It is the oldest building occupied by the French embassy, facing Yakimanka Street (No. 43) - Igumnov House - was built in 18831893 to the design by Nikolay Pozdeyev (1855-1893), and cost the architect his life. Igumnov family acquired the lot in 1851; in 1880 Nikolay Igumnov hired Nikolay Pozdeyev to rebuild the old two-story empire style mansion into a larger residence. Pozdeyev, a graduate of Imperial Academy of Arts, already had five years of practice as the town architect of Yaroslavl, where Igumnov had substantial investments in textile mills. Halfway through the project, in 1888, architect and the client agreed to discard the existing structure altogether and redesign the building from scratch; its dimensions, as built, increased to 45×33 meters. After 13 years of slow progress the building attracted public attention and became a target of numerous art critics, detesting its pseudo-Russian luxury; whether for this reason or due to sheer greed, Igumnov refused to compensate cost overruns to Pozdeyev; the ruined architect committed suicide in October 1893.",0
"A kaleidoscope of colors, swirling and blending,  
In a painter's dream, a vision never-ending.  
A canvas of hues, a symphony of light,  
An artist's mind dances amidst this sight. 

Reds and oranges, yellows and greens,  
Each color complements, each color beams.  
Blues and purples, pinks and golds,  
A rainbow of emotions, a story to be told. 

Brush strokes like whispers, gentle and fine,  
Colors intertwine, a melody divine.  
A masterpiece born, each brushstroke an ode,  
To beauty and wonder, forever it will hold. 

A kaleidoscope of colors, a symphony of light,  
Swirling and blending, a painter's delight.  
In a world full of beauty, the canvas comes alive,  
And in the painter's dream, its colors forever thrive.",1

"My day has been a really good day today. I meet up with my ex boyfriend and went out to lunch with him at the Central Market Cafe. Then we began to talk about the idea of seeing other people and we got in a relatively big argument. He accused me of seeing another guy and I told him the truth that I was seeing another guy. We talked to each other and told ourselves that we were going to try and fix and mend the relationship that we once had. It made me feel a lot better about myself because for the past couple of months I have been feeling very depressed and gloomy about myself. I wanted to talk to somebody and when Nick came around and wanted to talk to me for the first time in a long time about the problems that we were having it made me feel a lot better. Nick is my ex boyfriend, just to let you know. The when I got home I started thinking about how far behind I was on all of my school work and I began to stress out about all of the reading and studying that needed to be accomplished in such a short time frame. Then I was thinking about what my Health Promotion teacher told us about relaxing to alleviate stress and other worries that we are having with our lives right now. So I am just now beginning to calm down about my school work and the other stresses in my life right now and trying to pace myself so that I can stay ahead. So I am finally getting to this writing assignment that I had no idea about until last Monday. This just added to the stress that I was feeling about my life but now some of it is off my shoulders because I am doing this assignment. I am worried about my mom right now also because she just went through a divorce and now I am out of her life and not living with her so she really doesn't have anyone to talk to. She always sounds so miserable on the phone when I talk to her and she makes me feel bad for leaving home even when she wanted me to leave. My dad and my mother just recently got a divorce and it has torn all of our lives up but I think that it has torn my mother's life up the most. She had change jobs and start a new life over without my father and his harassing ways to hold her back from wanting the most from her life. She acts so depressed when I hear from her and in turn it makes me feel very depressed about my life too. I love my mother to death but I just wish that she would keep me out of her problems and go seek some help from someone who can actually help her. Anyways I think that school is going to turn out really good and I hope that I can keep up my grades and make it into the Nursing School. I am already into the Pre Nursing School but I have to test into the Nursing School in order to become a Registered Nurse. I am excited about fulfilling my life long dream about becoming a nurse and helping out people who are need of assistance and love. I want to work with children in a pediatric doctors office when I graduate. I really do not want to work in an emergency room with very sick people who come in there almost dead and there is no chance for us to save them. I want to help people out and I don't want to feel like I didn't help them out by letting a person die.",0

"Unless a grain of wheat goes into the ground and dies, it remains nothing but a grain of wheat.          —John 12:24
The ingredients gathered, a few small red tufts of the dream spoor per sheaf of Demeter’s blonde wheat, reaped in mourning, in silence, ground up with the pollen and mixed into white wine and honey. These stored forms of light taken under the ground. Taken by mouth. First those who by birth hold in secret the word; then placed on the tongues of the new ones, into whose ears it is meant to be whispered. Word murdered, forgotten so long ago, placed as a kiss on the lips of the soon-to-be-no-longer breathing who mean to enter death with open eyes, with mouths saying Death, what death? We have no word for it in our country where the bride of a brighter oblivion reigns. Not the purple-haired god but the child queen, the raped girl, come back from the dead hand in hand with the child she conceived there, returned in a resurrected virginity, wind through green wheat. Present-day site of a minor refinery in Christ.

Men who bungled their way through the next eighteen centuries before finally descending into the earth themselves, and what they found there they used, and we thank you for destroying the destroyers of the world.

" There are valid reasons for both options, and ultimately, the decision depends on an individual's circumstances and goals.  For those who choose to go straight to college after high school, they can build momentum and stay on track with their education. They may also have a better chance of securing scholarships or financial aid if they apply immediately. Additionally, they can establish a social network and develop valuable skills while studying.  On the other hand, taking a year or more off to work or travel can provide valuable life experiences that can enhance a person's academic pursuits. Working can help people save money for tuition and provide real-world experience that can complement their studies. Traveling, on the other hand, can offer unique perspectives and cultural insights that can be beneficial in the classroom and beyond.  Ultimately, the decision to go to college immediately or take a gap year should be based on individual circumstances, goals, and priorities. It is important to weigh the potential benefits and drawbacks of both options and make an informed decision.            ",1
"Crap, I was half way through this assignment and my computer just cut out or something. I really hope it didn't already submit because I don't want to screw up my credit for this paper. Great, now I'm completely paranoid that I've managed to screw up something so simple. I'll keep my fingers crossed. I need all the help I can get to do well in this class. Actually, I haven't worried about my grades in a long time. When tests start, I'll panic. It's really hard to focus in my morning classes during lectures. I never get enough rest. My schedule's all out of order. I can't fall asleep until around two or three and then have to wake up at seven. I'm tired all day long. I hear my TV and want to go watch it. I always put stuff off and watch too much television. I have a problem with procrastinating. I never used to be this bad. I'm scared that since I can't get on a study plan, I'll fail. I hate it when I over use a word when I'm writing. I feel like I haven't written enough, but does length matter?  My birthday is next week, which somewhat depresses me. I'm not close to any of my friends, and I'm scared they're going to forget about me. I feel like the only loser out of my friends who's not having this great college experience. It's not that I'm homesick, just kind of restless and bored. I haven't met that many people and frankly, feel like an outcast. My head hurts, but I have no tylenol. I hate swallowing pills. I used to break them up and put them in yogurt. I'm such a wuss. My roommate went home for the afternoon. I'm glad she is gone. She can be a little much with the extreme cleanliness. I went out of town one weekend, and she made my bed. I don't really want her invading my space and touching my things.",0

"The crash of Alitalia Flight 618 was an accident involving a Douglas DC-7C of the Italian airline Alitalia in Shannon, Ireland, on 26 February 1960. Of the 52 people on board, only 18 survived with serious injuries. Accident On the morning of 26 February 1960, Flight 618 arrived at its first stopover at Shannon Airport for refueling in order to continue its journey across the Atlantic, while under the supervision of a check pilot. The flight had been given permission to takeoff from runway 05 with a clear but still dark and partially overcast sky just 45 minutes after its initial arrival. Takeoff proceeded without issue and the crew retracted the gear before making a left turn when the aircraft had climbed to a height of  with the landing lights still on. While turning, the aircraft's power was reduced slightly but the  flaps were never fully retracted. Instead of climbing, the airliner only accelerated and lost altitude very quickly. The pilots were unable to prevent the left wing tip from striking a stone wall near the Clonloghan church followed by the left engines and the rest of the wing which also struck several gravestones of the surrounding cemetery. At this point the aircraft's fate was sealed and after the propellers of the right engine also scraped past the wall, the out of control aircraft slammed into the ground in an open field beyond the cemetery and burst into flames.",0
" Reading a book to a child can be a fun and engaging way to promote their literacy skills, language development, and imagination. Here are some tips on how to read a book to a child:  Choose age-appropriate books: Select books that are appropriate for the child's age and developmental stage. Younger children may enjoy books with colorful illustrations and simple sentences, while older children may be more interested in chapter books with more complex storylines.  Create a cozy environment: Find a comfortable and quiet place to read the book with the child. Make sure there are no distractions, such as television or electronic devices, that could interrupt the reading experience.  Use expressive voice and gestures: Read the book with an animated voice and use facial expressions and gestures to convey emotions and emphasize important parts of the story. This can help keep the child engaged and interested in the story.  Encourage interaction: Ask the child questions about the story, characters, and illustrations to encourage their participation and understanding of the book. You can also pause and let the child predict what might happen next.  Make connections: Relate the story to the child's experiences or other books they have read. This can help the child understand the story and make it more meaningful to them.  Repeat favorite books: Children often enjoy hearing the same book repeatedly, so don't be afraid to read the same book multiple times. This can also help the child develop their memory and comprehension skills.  Remember that reading should be a fun and enjoyable experience for both the child and the reader. By following these tips, you can help promote a love of reading and learning in your child.       ",1
"The Catharpin Creek Formation is a Late Triassic (late Norian to Rhaetian) geologic formation in Maryland and Virginia. It is found along the western edge of the Culpeper Basin, one of the largest sedimentary basins in the Newark Supergroup. Compared to the underlying Bull Run Formation, the Catharpin Creek Formation is dominated by much coarser sedimentary rocks such as sandstone and conglomerate. The base of the formation is reddish arkosic sandstone, which grades into drabber thin-bedded siltstone and shale in cyclical sequences. The general depositional environment is reconstructed as a system of active streams running down from alluvial fans which developed along highlands further west of the basin. A few outcrops contain lenses of a conglomerate unit known as the Goose Creek Member. This unit preserves a diverse array of reddish brown to grayish green pebbles and cobbles derived from metamorphic rocks, alongside some sandstone and sandy siltstone. The pebbles and cobbles would have originated from the Proterozoic and Cambrian Catoctin Formation and Chilhowee Group exposed along the Blue Ridge Mountains.",0

"  The idea of banning passenger cars in cities with extensive public transportation systems is a controversial one, and there are valid arguments both in favor of and against it.  On the one hand, such a ban could greatly reduce air and noise pollution, as well as traffic congestion. By forcing people to rely on walking, biking, or public transportation, the number of cars on the road would decrease significantly, leading to improved air quality and reduced traffic noise. In addition, public transportation systems could become more efficient and reliable with fewer cars on the road, leading to faster and more convenient travel for commuters.  On the other hand, such a ban could have negative consequences for some individuals, particularly those who rely on cars for their livelihoods, such as taxi drivers and delivery personnel. Additionally, some people may find it difficult or inconvenient to rely solely on public transportation or active transportation modes like walking and biking. For example, individuals with disabilities or who live far from public transportation stops may find it challenging to get around.  Overall, a ban on passenger cars in cities with extensive public transportation systems could have significant benefits for the environment and traffic flow. However, it is important to consider the potential negative consequences for individuals who rely on cars for their livelihoods or find it difficult to rely solely on public transportation or active transportation modes. A more feasible approach may be to promote the use of public transportation and active transportation modes while still allowing for the use of passenger cars.  ",1
"At the mouth of the river,
Moon, stars, an Arctic calm,
The twin lights at the end of the piers
Revolving with the smoothness
We expect of supernatural machinery.
Seen from down here on the beach
The harbored ocean slowly tilts,
Like a mirror discreetly manhandled
By night from the giant room
It was supposed to occupy forever.
The mind says now, but the stars
On their angelic gimbals roll
And fade, a tide of constellations
Breaking nowhere, every night
About this time. Strike up the band.
In the tumbledown bar, the singer
Has fallen from stardom and grace,
But though her interests nowadays
Are wholly secular, she can
Still refer back to the angels,
And knowing that song, we share
A moment with the saved before
We leave to make the crossing.
No captain, no ferry, but
Cross we shall, believe you me.",0
"This is an interesting assignment to be doing. I don't like writing but this is different. I like being able to wrinte whatever pops into mw head and not worry about it being scrutinezed by an evil english teacher. Twenty minutes is a long time to be writing though. I could be doing sometinhg like playing a game of starcraft or half life right now, or writintg some c code. I am going to implement a router advertisement program to take advantage that windows boxes are stupid and let me remotly rewrite thier routing rules. Its nice of them to do this for me, but  I'll do that later. I wonder if I should write it under windows or Linux, or sine ither flavor of unix. I'll prob write it under windows if I gan get the neccesary access to the transport layer of the protocol stack just for that change of writing something usefull for windows. I actually have written some useful software for windows. Most of it would easily cross compile to unix. A fun peice of code I wrote takes a string such as ""sin(x)^6-3**4-x^(e^x)"" and evaluates it as a mathematical expression for a given value of x. If you've ever written code, this is not easy to do. I am listing to music right now. It helps stimulate the mind. :) I usually listen to music when programming. I am more productive that way. I am able to apporach problems and dig out the answer of some nasty place its hiding. 20 minutes sure is a long time when you would rather be doing something else. How many points do I get for doing this anyway. After I do thins I may go and eat or spend some time with Melissa, my girlfriend, who also happens to be my fiance  :)  she's great. After that I can write my router advertisement program. That would be fun. I love melissa. Being in austin is great. I like it much better that being in san antonio. I want there last weekend and wanted to be back up here the whole time. That could have been because all y stuff is up here. My parents miss me though. I sohuld call them. I;ll do that later. I have a lot of homework to do. Lets see, I'll check the chem web site after this and see what problems I have to do. I have to do the other assignment for this class later, and read. I have 2 sections of math, and reading and some homework in double E, college of engineering is college. I am a computer engr. student. EE is probably my best calss this semester, but psych is next, math is boring because it is going too slow (don't tewll my prof I wrote that) and I just don't like chem, the highlight of the class is when dr white starts singing. He is a weird guy. only 7 minutes before I can hit submit. I like UT. its a fun place to be. I need to buy another compputer. I host a site that provides free domain and web hosting to whoever wants it, and the boxes I have right now are slower thatn anything. I also need to call network soulutions and beat the m up until they do their jobs. I am hot. My apartment complex needs to fix the air conditioning. That would be good. aLl my roomates are in san antonio for the weekend, but I stayed here. I should call my parents later. That would be nice. I love melissa. 5 minutes left. my attention span is shortening. I will write my router advertisement prog first because melissa is sleeping. I need to go to HEB and buy some sprite. I havent had any in a could days. Since shool has started I have gone through 6 12 packs. Tonioght I am going to try this company called midnight taco's for dinner. they sound good and operate between 7pm and 3am. I hope the food is good. I want a job, but a good one like I had in san antonio. I would like to put some moniy into my bank acct rather than just withdrawing it. That would be good. I only have 2 more hours of experiments to do, it will be nice to finishe them. I love melissa 2 minutes left I am hitting the submint button at exactly 4:50 , even if I am in mid-sentance. I need to turn the music back on, it finished playing, htats better, I can't spell (thats is waht I meant) rage againsta the machine is on. 1 more minute. Melissa is great. Shool is good, it will get better once I get into my major sequence. Time for me to go soon, I want that clock to say 4:50, the phone is ringing. bye",0

"As I sit in my dorm room at this point in my life, I can think of one thing only, sadness. Sadness because I miss my family and my boyfriend and because I feel extremely lonely at this huge school. I am overwhelmed with my thoughts and concerns. I am scared about meeting new people, scared about making good grades, and in general I'm scared about starting all over again. I know that I should be so excited that I get this opportunity to begin my life again and start new adventures, but I'm not. Last summer, for the first time in my life, I felt like I belonged and I was extremely happy. Of course as soon as I obtained that wonderful feeling, it is ripped away from me at an instant.

Joining a sorority was something I thought I had to do when I got here. So I did and I'm not sure it was the right decision for me. I think snobbery overwhelms my sorority and that bothers me a great deal. I really don't know exactly what my problem is but I just don't feel comfortable here. I am in love for the first time and the guy I love is in Fort Worth. We are not dating because we both agree it would be too hard but I love him so much that words could not possibly describe. It hurts to be in love and know that I will probably never be with him because of our location. I want to transfer but I I would be terrified to do that just for a guy. But when I think about it, I would do that for him. My thoughts are in a jumble right now and I feel many emotions running through my body.

"Faith is like a light that guides our way,
A pillar strong that helps us stay.
When the road is dark and bleak,
It is faith that we must seek.

It's the belief in something bigger,
Something that makes our heart trigger.
A force that can help us climb,
Over the mountains, standing high.

Faith is the wind beneath our wings,
The trust that makes us believe in things.
Hope in the midst of despair,
The promise of a better air.

It's the deepest part of our soul,
The mark that makes us whole.
A connection to the divine,
A power that makes us shine.

Faith is what keeps us going,
A light that keeps on glowing.
It's the spark that sets us free,
In the journey that we must be.

"Developmental psychology is the scientific study of the psychological development of individuals from birth to adulthood. It covers a range of topics, including infancy, childhood, adolescence, and adulthood.  Development is a process that starts at conception and continues until the individual reaches adulthood. Developmental psychologists study how different experiences shape an individual's psychological development. They use a variety of research methods, including surveys, interviews, and laboratory experiments.  The field of developmental psychology is growing rapidly. New research is being published every day, and the field is attracting new professionals who are exploring new ways to understand human development. The scope of developmental psychology is vast, and it offers insights into everything from how children learn to think and feel to the origins of mental disorders.",1
" A family celebration that has special meaning for me is the annual reunion that we have every summer. This tradition started when I was a child and my grandparents decided to invite all their children and grandchildren to their farm for a week of fun and bonding. It was a way of keeping the family connected and passing on the family’s values, history, and culture1.  Every year, we look forward to this family gathering as a time to catch up with our relatives, share stories, play games, and enjoy delicious food. Some of the activities that we do together are:  Cooking a big barbecue on the first night and having a bonfire with marshmallows and hot chocolate2. Going on a hayride around the farm and visiting the animals. Playing board games or puzzles that we get as gifts from our grandparents2. Watching a movie together on a projector screen in the barn. Having a talent show where everyone showcases their skills or talents. Taking a family photo in matching pajamas that we also get from our grandparents2. These family traditions are very meaningful to me because they make me feel part of a larger community that loves and supports me. They also give me a sense of identity and belonging as I learn more about my family’s roots and heritage. They also create positive memories that I can cherish for a lifetime.  I hope to continue this tradition with my own children someday and pass on the values and culture that I learned from my grandparents. I think family celebrations are important for developing a healthy and happy family unit and strengthening the bonds between generations        ",1
"Her body is not so white as
anemony petals nor so smooth—nor
so remote a thing. It is a field
of the wild carrot taking
the field by force; the grass
does not raise above it.
Here is no question of whiteness,
white as can be, with a purple mole
at the center of each flower.
Each flower is a hand’s span
of her whiteness. Wherever
his hand has lain there is
a tiny purple blemish. Each part
is a blossom under his touch
to which the fibres of her being
stem one by one, each to its end,
until the whole field is a
white desire, empty, a single stem,
a cluster, flower by flower,
a pious wish to whiteness gone over—
or nothing.",0
"I just went to the union to eat chick-fil-a. i had a coupon for a free meal but they didn't honor it and I felt like I had waste my effort as well as my frined of walkin to the union and wasted our money paying for such an overpriced meal. now, I'm sleepy- I always get sleepy after I eat- especially greasy food. I don't think I have a weight problem, but I htink I should make more frequent trips to gregory to tone myself up. I don't' put much on personal appearance but it's not something to not take care of. i wish I could go take a nap now but I want to finish this assignment and I don't 'want to lie down right after I eat because I heard that it makes u retain all the fat in ur meal if u go to sleep right after u eat because ur body thinks ur sleepign and stores all the fat. i'm not sure how that works but wutever. i'm on aol right now. waiting for a friend from back home in houston to sign on. so I decided to check out the psychology web site while I waited. he's prolly in class at Rice University right now. he's an engineer major and also my best friend. i have two best friends - kristina and stephen. me and stephen have only been best friends for a short period of time where kristina has been my best friend since the sixth grade. she's also in houston. I hate austin it sucks. i wish I was home - me and stephen are confused as to wut defines our relationship- we have strong feelings for each other. romantic one. but we don't seem to think a long distance relationship is ideal. plus we're not committing peoople. i'm awfully tired of this assignment and only 7 minutes have passed by. my neck hurts. i'm usually a tying sorta person. and I guess this is good practice for me- I use the back space key a lot - I wish I could type as well as my roomate jenny lau. she's an excellent typist. i'm just a scrub typer- I have bad coordination- I cna't dance- can't sing - can't 'type- can't play video games. sigh. i'm a good studier though. i don't' mind takin time to do things throughly-- I'm slow at pretty much everything I do but I do them sorta well. i wish stephen would hurry up and get on. he doestn' have his computer because it's at home but I'm sure there are plenty of resources at Rice university. i wish I went to rice. he told me about wut they did up there and it sounds so fun I wish I could get in and I wish I could afford it!then I would sooooo want to go! I think if I do ok this year I could prolly get in. but I don't know abou the other part - I'm gong to ut on scholarship money and I thinki t's going to run out before the 4 years are over. i wish money wasnt' such a big issue in my life. i'm unemployed right now and I have no cash flow but out. it sucks. i think next semester I'll start a work study thing. i wish my parents were architects adn hemotoligists liek stephen's parent's - they're on their way to becoming millionaires. i wish this was in store for my parents. they make lousy money and htey have 4 kids and 3 of whom are in college. my brother is at the university of houston right now and so is my sister. and my best friend. ltos of ppl from school go there. my home town houston. i like it there better than here. i'm sleepy. 13 minutes have gone by . man. where are u stephen? I slept with his tshirt on my bear last nite. i think about him often. i don't think I want to start a romantic relationship with him because I don't think it's worth the risk. i'm an idealist and a romantic and I doubt my best friend could fulfill my romantic desires as a boyfriend. he's a passive person who lets other people control. however he's always in control in his mind. he's so smart and so quiet. he keeps all his thoughts to himself unless u pry at him. he'll open up to me more than his life long best friend brian. i think it's because I'm a gurl and I'm always nosy. so I don't know. i doubt we're right for each other but u never knwo these things we could end up married. highly unlikely but possible. stephen said that he'll save up his money and take me to hawaii- I know that sounds so stupid and so unlikely but I believe it he does get a job soon. a high paying one- like at a computer place like this summer. he can do it - and if he does save up enough money- he really will take me. we've discussed it and he said he'd really try and I believe him. i guess it sounds like I'm trying to convience myself. maybe I am. but I really want to go and I belive that he could make this happen for the both  of us. he believes in having fun and living life so spring break we're there! I hope! hehehe. ok. 2 more minutes and I cna quit. after this I guess I'll write my lil estebie an email - this would be his second day of class at rice. he loves it there. he' an owl all the way. well ok times basically up bye bye bye bye!!!!",0
" Shoes are a type of footwear that cover and protect the feet with a sole and a heel. They can also serve as a fashion accessory, expressing one’s personal style and taste.

They are also versatile enough to pair with casual outfits, such as jeans or chinos. Clogs: These are slip-on shoes that have a thick wooden sole and an open back. They may also have a leather strap across the top of the foot or a closed toe. Clogs are popular among people who like a rustic and bohemian style. They are also comfortable and durable, as they can withstand wear and tear. Espadrilles: These are summer shoes that have a fiber sole and a canvas upper that laces around the ankles. They can be either flat or platform, and they come in various colors and patterns. Espadrilles are popular among women who want a casual and chic shoe that can add some height and flair to their outfits. They are also lightweight and breathable, making them ideal for warm weather. Flip flops: These are flat sandals that have a Y-shaped strap that separates the big toe from the other toes. They are usually made of rubber or plastic, and they come in many colors and designs. Flip flops are popular among people who like a simple and easy shoe that can be worn for beach or pool activities. They are also convenient and inexpensive, as they can be easily slipped on and off. High heels: These are shoes that have a heel that is higher than one inch. They can come in many styles, such as pumps, sandals, stilettos, wedges, or platforms. High heels are popular among women who want to enhance their appearance and confidence by adding some height and elegance to their outfits. They are also suitable for formal or special occasions, such as weddings or parties.  ",1
"In the brown water, Thick and silver-sheened in the sunshine, Liquid and cool in the shade of the reeds, A pike dozed. Lost among the shadows of stems He lay unnoticed. Suddenly he flicked his tail, And a green-and-copper brightness Ran under the water. Out from under the reeds Came the olive-green light, And orange flashed up Through the sun-thickened water. So the fish passed across the pool, Green and copper, A darkness and a gleam, And the blurred reflections of the willows on the opposite bank Received it.",0
"The past week I have honestly felt the most incredible feeling of being overwhelmed. I am so frustrated and annoyed by everyone around me and everything that they do. I so badly want to step forward and correct everything that these people are doing wrong but for some reason I keep holding myself back. This frustration only makes my head hurt and keeps me angry at the world. My presence then becomes quite rude and unfriendly. I'm not quite sure what to do about this little problem. I really don't think that it's me. My suitemate is about to push me over the edge. She never picks up after herself, never helps clean the dorm room, never buys and groceries (even though she finds its all right to consume mass quantities of the food that me and my two other roomates buy), and she basically is worthless around the room. For example, the other day she mentioned that we needed paper towels and bottled water. On most circumstances that wouldnt bother me, however, she makes these claims but at the same time takes no initiative to fix them. She just assumes that me or my roomates will take care of the missing items in the room. She is from Beverly Hills. Im under that impression that she had someone to pick up after her and do everything for her when she lived there. Typical if you ask me. I just can't handle her behavior or her attitude anymore. On top of that, I am homesick. I miss my friends. I miss being with Richie. He'll call me once and a while. Usually he'll call me non stop for a straight week, and then I won't hear from him for quite a while. I get so anxious to hear from him, but he acts like he could care less if he talked to me. That makes me so mad. My roomate aka my best friend since middle school chastises me everytime i talk to him. It just makes me so upset that she thinks that he doesnt care about me in the least. Sure, he may not show the normal feelings that most people show towards the ones that they care about, but I know that he cares about me. If he didnt care, he wouldnt bother calling me. Its honestly one of the worst feelings knowing that your best friend in the world is sitting there making fun of you and getting annoyed by the fact that you are in a complete state of happiness when you talk to the one person you care about. It really makes me wonder why she is the one person I confide in the most. Speaking of her, she is in this relationship with a boy whom I adore as a friend. He is so much fun to be around, but he is here all the time. I turn around and he is always there. I never get to sleep in my own room, I am constantly forgotten about or simply not included in activities that she would normally include me in, and to top it all off, the relationship is not even healthy. I find it ironic that she gets mad at me when I talk to Richie, and feels that she can make whatever assumptions or claims about my relationship with him, but when I make the smallest remark about her and her boyfriend, she flips out. It doesn't seem all that fair to me. But then again, what is fair?  Is it fair that I want to be with someone that I can't have anymore? No its not fair, but thats the way that it will be. Sometimes I wonder if I will ever get a break; If maybe one day I'll get lucky and things will turn out the way I wanted them to, or if maybe Richie will wake up one day and decide that he wants to be with me and not with the girl he is with right now. Sometimes I wonder if my relationship with my mom will ever improve. She and I couldn't possibly be more different than we are. I can't even believe that I am her child sometimes. She acts so much like a child. If she doesn't get her way she mopes and she has to put me down to make herself feel better. She denies having made my sister depressed throughout her late childhood and early adultood. I think that its the subtle remarks about my figure, my study habits, my relationships that make me so mad at her. I want to tell her how I feel but she will retaliate and take something away from me that I need. She always used to do that in high school. If I told her what was on my mind, she would take away my car, or my privileges to stay out late. I can never win. Its either   give up my priviliges   or keep my mouth shut. It is a lose lose situation. I just miss Richie so much. That could be the root of all my unhappiness. My mom, and suitemate could all just be elements of my sadness due to my distance away from him. He called me today. Ironically I was lying in bed thinking about him, when the phone rang. It felt so good to see his name on my cell phone when i looked at it.",0
" Advocates of this idea argue that it would allow parents to ensure their children's health, intelligence, and physical attractiveness. They believe that if we have the technology to select for specific traits, then why not use it to help children avoid genetic diseases or disabilities and enhance their cognitive abilities?  However, this kind of genetic engineering raises many ethical concerns. One of the most significant concerns is that it could lead to social inequality and discrimination based on the characteristics that parents choose for their children. For example, if wealthy parents can afford to design their children to be smarter, taller, and more attractive, it could widen the gap between the rich and the poor. This could also lead to discrimination against people who are not genetically engineered, creating a new form of societal hierarchy based on genetics.  Furthermore, it raises the question of who has the right to decide what traits are desirable and what traits are not. The idea of designing children can quickly spiral into eugenics, where some groups of people are considered inferior and unworthy of existence. This is a morally dangerous path that could lead to the dehumanization of certain groups.  Finally, there is the question of whether this kind of genetic engineering is necessary. While it may be desirable to eliminate genetic diseases or disabilities, there is no clear consensus on what makes a person intelligent, beautiful, or athletic. Many of these traits are subjective and can vary based on cultural norms and personal preferences. In essence, we could end up creating a homogenized society where everyone looks and thinks alike, eliminating diversity and creativity.  In conclusion, while the idea of designing children with specific physical and personality traits may seem attractive, it raises many ethical and societal concerns. It is essential to approach this issue with caution and carefully consider the long-term implications of this technology.                     ",1
"The villain lurks in shadows deep,
A creature born to scheme and creep.
His heart is black as coal and tar,
And evil thoughts have left their scar.

He revels in his wicked game,
Taking pleasure in causing pain.
He cares not for the woes he sows,
In his heart, only darkness grows.

His twisted mind seeks to destroy,
The light of any hope or joy.
He revels in the misery he wrought,
Infernal flames are all he's got.

No one dares to face his wrath,
For the villain walks the devil's path.
His deeds are known, his name reviled,
His presence leaves us cold and chilled.

But though he thinks himself a king,
The villain's power cannot win.
For though he may leave chaos in his wake,
In time, his fate he can't escape.",1

"Well this is it , I guess?  My first writing assignment in Psychology. I sure hope that no one calls and interrupts my internet access. Watch!  Now that I've said that, someone will probably call. I'm the type of person that thinks that way. I mean, that if I say that I don't want something to happen, then I think that it probably will. The thing is, that those negative things that I think will happen seldom do. I guess I am just a cynical person like that. Wait, is that cynical or pessimistic?  I don't know!  Maybe I just think that way because I think it's humorous, or maybe I'm just trying to keep myself in check. Whatever it is, I just think that way sometimes. Enough about that. There sure are a lot  of fine women here at UT. Well. Maybe it's because I went to an all boy school for four years that I think that way. No, that's not it. These girls would look good regardless of where I went to high school. The good thing is that there are a lot of girls, the bad thing is that I havent met one yet. I have always been shy around girls and going to an all-boy high school didn't help anything. Well, I will say it right here!  I am going to do my best to get over that. With all these girls, I just can't let them pass me by. I see how happy my roommate and friend is with his girlfriend. I also hear countless stories of all these ""fine"" girls that he has met. I want to be the one with the stories and the girl. Not that I want  my friend to not have the stories and the girl, but I want those things, too. Heartbreaking story:  there is this real ""fly"" Asian girl in my Chemistry class. On the first day, she sat right next to me!  Then I don't see here for a couple of days. Today I see her, finally!  And she's holding some dude's hand!  Oh well, I guess?!? There's an addiction that I must get over. Not drugs, or alcohol, or anything bad like that. You see, I love to play at the local arcade. I must spend about two dollars every other day in there. My money isn't limitless and everytime I put a quarter into the arcade machine, then that's one less load of laundry that I can do. Now do I want 20 minutes of entertainment or clean clothes. I don't know. It seems that every free moment I have I am in that stupid arcade. A tie-in with the last paragraph: maybe I don't meet any girls because I am in the arcade all the time. Prediction:  I get out of the arcade, I take on an outgoing attitude, and I will meet a girl. Before I finish with this writing assignment, let me tell you about the two addictions that I have that I don't really care to get rid of. I love the Simpsons, and hip-hop. There's something about both of those that I just find pure joy in. In both cases, I see, here, and enjoy things that most people don't. It seems that the more obscure or ""hidden"" the things that I find enjoyment, the more joy I find in it. I guess it's that I am such a fan of both that the ordinary just isn't quite good enough. That's sort of bad. I should just enjoy the Simpsons and hip-hop for what they are and stop looking for the obscure. Well, this wasnt so bad. With this  being the first assignment, I guess I'll see you( the psychology web-page) tomorrow .",0

"A village so ancient, so wild and so old,
Its very walls and streets seem to scold,
Every stranger that dare enter its gate,
Warning them of the horrors and fate.

Its people are silent, with eyes that loom,
Not one smile or greeting, just a sense of doom,
Each face a mirror of the other,
In the stillness, their solemnity nowhere to smother.

The trees and bushes grow tall and dark,
Twisted and gnarled, like an old man's bark,
The villagers with secrets as deep as the forest,
Hiding things that make one's heart crest.

Tales of ghosts and spirits that roam at night,
Thick fog that obscures and conceals any light,
Noises that can't be explained or fought,
Unknown shadows that are leaving distraught.

The air is heavy, cold and damp,
A feeling that one might lose their stamp,
The village's clutches leave you with a shiver,
And fear is the final, eternal figure.",1
" History is often seen as a dry, boring subject by many students, who may wonder why they need to learn about events that happened long ago. However, a deeper look into the study of history reveals that it is an essential part of our education and understanding of the world around us. In this essay, I will explain why learning about the past is important and why it should not be dismissed as irrelevant.  Firstly, history provides us with a sense of identity and belonging. By learning about the past, we can understand the roots of our cultural heritage and the evolution of our societies. We can also appreciate the contributions of our ancestors and the struggles they faced, which have shaped our modern world. Without an understanding of our past, we cannot fully understand ourselves or the world we live in.  Secondly, history teaches us valuable lessons that can be applied to our present and future. By examining past events, we can learn from the successes and failures of our predecessors and make more informed decisions in the present. We can also develop a better understanding of the consequences of our actions and the impact they may have on future generations. For example, the study of past pandemics can help us to prepare for and prevent future outbreaks.  Thirdly, history helps us to develop critical thinking skills. By examining multiple perspectives and sources, we can learn to evaluate evidence, identify biases, and form our own opinions. This is particularly important in today's world, where fake news and misinformation are prevalent. A strong understanding of history can help us to discern truth from fiction and make informed decisions based on reliable information.  Finally, history provides us with a sense of continuity and context. By understanding the past, we can appreciate how the world has evolved and how different events and ideas are connected. We can also understand how our current problems and challenges have roots in the past and how they have been addressed by previous generations. This can provide us with a sense of hope and resilience, knowing that we are part of a larger story and that we can learn from the struggles of those who came before us.  In conclusion, learning about history is essential for a well-rounded education and a deeper understanding of the world around us. It provides us with a sense of identity, teaches us valuable lessons, develops critical thinking skills, and provides us with a sense of continuity and context. While it may not always be the most exciting subject, it is certainly one of the most important, and students should approach it with an open mind and a willingness to learn.  ",1
"Oh, sweet little feline, with your soft coat so fine,
you're a creature of grace, and a friend of mine.
You purr when I pat you, and rub against my hand,
you make me feel cherished, a feeling so grand.

Your eyes are like jewels, they shimmer and shine,
and I could lose myself in them, anytime.
Whenever you're near me, my heart starts to race,
the love that we share, is hard to replace.

You're playful and curious, and clever too,
always finding a way, to make me laugh anew.
You curl up beside me, when I'm feeling low,
and chase away sadness, with a comforting glow.

My dear little feline, you're more than a pet,
you're a cherished companion, that I'll never forget.
Your presence brings joy, to my life every day,
and I'm grateful for you, in every single way.

So here's to my sweet kitty, my furry little dove,
I'll love and cherish you, with all of my love.",1
"I'm actually really tired, but I want to finish as much homework as I possibly can. It's not terribly late so I thought it would be nice to write something on my thoughts right before I go to bed. Today was a good day. Not too much stress and I talked to a lot of my friends and family. Its always nice when I get to talk to old friends from hs. today I met a girl that went to the same elementary as me. we didn't know each other, but we had a connection because we were from the same town. MOst people have never heard of my town before, so it was pretty cool. I also met a girl this morning that went to the other hs in my town, which again is strange. I actually met a lot of people, one of the girls has a class with me and we live right down the hall from each other. I'm glad to know that I have someone that I can study with or ask a question if I need help anytime I want. One good thing about college is that it's really easy to make friends. Even if you're a shy person, there's always someone who is willing to talk to you. I used to be really shy, but I don't have much of a problem introducing myself to random people, I actually enjoy doing that now. I look foward to those that I will meet tomorrow, I just hope I can remember everyone's name when I see them again. I've met so many people in such a short period of time that it becomes difficult to match names with faces. I enjoy all of my classes, I'm feeling pretty comfortable in my decision on what I plan to major in. It seems that I really do enjoy chemistry and biology, but I'm really glad to have a psychology class to take my mind off of things that I have to do. I'm really excited about Wednesday. I'm going to try out for the rowing team. I think I'm really going to enjoy the workouts and meeting new people. I hope I make the team, but I don't want to get my hopes up, so I'm just going to see how it goes. Today I went to the gym to see how difficult rowing really is and I feel much more comfortable with my decision. I was able to row correctly, although it gets kind of confusing at times because it is not a natural movement. but I was able to row for 2000 meters non-stop my first try, and I think that's pretty good because I only have to row for 500 meters for the tryouts. I'm not sure how good my chances are at making the team. I haven't been on a sports team since middle school. but I have been in band since sixth grade. band may not be the best workout ever or the most strenuous, but marching can get pretty tiring, and I think that it has prepared me a little for this. I'm really good with endurance which is key in rowing. In high school, we had to march for 8 minutes straight. my senior year I had a solo and I had to run around to my different sets and then stand still and play a long slow balad for a couple of minutes and make it musical. That was pretty hard to play without people realizing I'm completely out of breath. But it was really rewarding, I had the opportunity to play in front of thousands at a time at our football games. I could never get up in front of a crowd and speak or sing, but I can play my flute in front of anyone. I really wish I was able to be in the UT band. I had always wanted to be part of the band, but now my major doesn't allow the time. I hope that later in my college career, I have the chance to be in the marching band at least once. I think it would be so much fun. Music has always been a big thing in my life, I love to play it, but I also love to listen to it. My favorite kind of music is country. I especially love george strait. I have most of his cd's. I know every word to every song he sings, I only need to hear the first chord of one of his songs and I'll know its him. I'm also a big fan of 80's movies. one of my favorites is young frankenstein. mel brooks makes wonderful movies, I think they're all hilarious. real genius is another good one I like. most of my favorite movies I'm able to quote from beginning to end. one of the classics is the princess bride. there are so many great one-liners in that movie. my dad and I always say random quotes from movies anytime something happens. my dad knows the most trivial things. he'll know the answer to the most random question you can think of. its pointless, but its pretty cool. my dad and I are really close, I wish I could be more like my dad. we grew really close when my mom passed away when I was little, he remarried, and now I have a brother and a sister. I love my little sister so much, she's the cutest. she never uses my real name, she always calls me sister. I really miss her. but I talk to her often and she's always so excited to hear from me. she just got a new rabit, she's had 5 and three of them were sold in the stock show and one of them died. but now she has 2. I hope the heat doesn't get to these two like the others. she's always really worried about them. she also has a dog, and I have a dog named princess. my dog is a choc. lab. she's really cute, but she's also really old.

"Sound, oh sound, how sweet thy tune
A melody that fills the room
A symphony of pitch and tone
A journey for the ears alone

From the softest whispers to the loudest cries
To the laughter of children and the lovers' sighs
It carries messages both small and grand
A language we all understand

It can soothe the soul and calm the mind
A balm to heal the hurting kind
It can uplift and inspire us all
And make our spirits rise and fall

It's the music of nature, of wind and waves
The rustling of leaves, and rain in caves
It's the tapping of feet, and clapping of hands
A rainbow of sound that never ends

Sound, oh sound, how it enriches life
The perfect symphony, free from strife
A gift that we must cherish and protect
A treasure whose value we cannot neglect.",1
"  The question of what age is appropriate for driving is a complex one that involves various factors, including physical, cognitive, emotional, and social development. On the one hand, younger drivers may have faster reflexes and better vision, but they may also be more impulsive, inexperienced, and prone to risky behavior. On the other hand, older drivers may have more experience, but they may also have slower reaction times, decreased vision, and other age-related health issues.  Different countries and states have different laws regarding the minimum age for obtaining a driver's license. For example, in some European countries, the minimum age is 18, while in the United States, it varies from 14 (with restrictions) to 16 to 18, depending on the state. In some countries, the age limit also varies based on the type of vehicle, such as motorcycles, trucks, or buses.  The decision of what age is appropriate for driving ultimately depends on balancing the risks and benefits, as well as the cultural and social norms of a particular society. It also requires considering various factors, such as the quality of driver education and training, the availability of public transportation, and the prevalence of car accidents and fatalities.  In summary, there is no easy answer to the question of what age is appropriate for driving. It is a complex and multifaceted issue that requires careful consideration of various factors. Ultimately, the decision of what age to allow people to drive should be based on a balance of safety, practicality, and individual rights and responsibilities.    ",1
" Each decade has its unique characteristics, and people may have different reasons for choosing a specific period. However, each era also had its challenges and limitations, such as social inequality, political unrest, and technological disadvantages.  That being said, I can provide some general information about popular decades and their significant events and cultural trends:  1920s (Roaring Twenties): This decade was characterized by cultural revolutions, including the rise of jazz music, flapper fashion, and prohibition. It was also a time of economic prosperity and industrial growth, but it was followed by the Great Depression.  1950s (Post-War Era): After World War II, the 1950s saw a rise in consumerism and suburbanization, as well as the beginning of the civil rights movement. Popular culture included the rise of rock 'n' roll music and television shows, but it was also marked by social conformity and political paranoia.  1960s (Counterculture Movement): The 1960s were a time of political and social upheaval, with the civil rights movement, anti-war protests, and the rise of the counterculture movement. It was also marked by the space race, the Vietnam War, and the assassination of prominent figures. Popular culture included the rise of psychedelic music and fashion, as well as the sexual revolution.  1980s (Reagan Era): The 1980s were marked by the conservative policies of the Reagan administration and the rise of neoliberalism. Popular culture included the rise of MTV and music videos, the emergence of hip-hop, and the influence of Hollywood movies.  Ultimately, the choice of which decade to live in is a matter of personal preference and depends on what aspects of that era one finds appealing. ",1

Prejudice can have many causes and effects, some of which are discussed below:  Causes of prejudice:  Socialization: Prejudice can be learned from family members, friends, and society at large. Children may pick up discriminatory attitudes and beliefs from their parents or peers.  Stereotyping: Prejudice often stems from stereotypes, which are oversimplified and distorted images of a group of people.  Fear and insecurity: Prejudice can arise from fear of the unknown or from a desire to protect one's own group.  Lack of contact: Prejudice can be reinforced by lack of contact with members of other groups, which leads to misunderstandings and mistrust.  Effects of prejudice:  Discrimination: Prejudice can lead to discrimination, where individuals are treated unfairly or unjustly based on their membership in a particular group.  Low self-esteem: Prejudice can negatively affect the self-esteem of individuals who are targeted by discriminatory attitudes and behaviors.

"I was one year old when my nanny went away
leaving no memory of a face that watched,
arms that held, hands that fed and cleaned me,
left no record of her voice or name. My father
died, leaving wisps of pipe smoke for a memory.
My mother went away to write in London,
left me at her home place, Ballyrankin,
a sheltered farm in the Slaney river valley.
I listened to stories from a paralyzed aunt
sitting among sleepy dogs next to the fire.
Statia cooked every day for the dining room,
churned butter, gave sugared bread to me and
her child Bernie, fed outside men in dirty boots
and greasy caps in her stone-flagged kitchen that
smelt of damp clothes, roasting meat, and cake.
I fished for minnows in Shillelagh stream under ash trees
where filtered sunlight made pools of silver water.
On one side horses grazed and swished
their tails at flies, on the far side cows rubbed
their backs against low beech tree branches.
My mother went away to hospital, left me with
English neighbors, the Smythe Vigours’
hairy legs banged on passage floorboards,
my bedroom filled with evening sun.
They warned against crying. I cried louder.
They took my pearl pink rosary beads given
to me by a monk from a mountain monastery.
He told me Holy Mary answered children’s prayers.
A protestant child, I didn’t know the words, but I knew
she’d hear me if I could catch the sunlight on her beads.",0
"A lone wolf howls at the moon,
Its sorrowful cry echoing through the night,
For its heart aches with a deep-seated gloom,
As it wanders through the darkness with no delight.

The wolf roams through the rugged terrain,
Pondering why it’s relegated to a solitary plight,
With no companion to share in the pain,
And no one to share in the beauty of starry night.

As the wolf continues to howl and moan,
Its voice echoes off the rock and stone,
In the distance, a pack of wolves answers its call,
And the lone wolf is no longer alone.

Together they run through the night,
Under the silvery moon so bright,
Their melancholic howls now a symphony,
As they celebrate the gift of fraternity.

No longer a lonely, mournful reprise,
In its pack, the wolf has found new life,
By the light of the moon, they run with glee,
A powerful reminder of the joys of fraternity.",1

Lies a universe untold,

Where stars twinkle and shine,

And galaxies unfold.

The vast expanse of space,

Full of mystery and wonder,

Where comets streak across,

Leaving trails of thunder.

Planets in orbit spin,

In their own celestial dance,

Each one unique and vivid,

A cosmic circumstance.

Black holes devour all,

In a never-ending quest,

To satisfy their hunger,

In an eternal conquest.

The universe is infinite,

And so too, is our desire,

To explore and understand,

The secrets it does inspire.

So let us journey forth,

In spaceships far and wide,

And marvel at the cosmos,

That we can't help but abide.",1
" I can provide you with some information that may help you form your own opinion on this issue.  The debate on whether sport fishing is cruel and should be abolished is a controversial one. Animal rights activists argue that sport fishing causes unnecessary pain and suffering to fish, and that it is a cruel and inhumane practice. On the other hand, some argue that sport fishing is a legitimate and enjoyable activity, and that it can actually promote conservation efforts.  Those who oppose sport fishing argue that fish are sentient beings, capable of experiencing pain and suffering. They argue that sport fishing causes fish to experience significant stress and pain, and that it can result in serious injury or death for the fish. They also argue that fish do not receive the same level of protection as other animals, and that this is a form of speciesism.  Supporters of sport fishing, on the other hand, argue that it is a legitimate recreational activity that can actually promote conservation efforts. They argue that many anglers practice catch-and-release fishing, in which the fish is returned to the water after it has been caught. This allows fish populations to be maintained and even increased, as fish have the opportunity to reproduce and grow to maturity.  In addition, many anglers argue that sport fishing is an important part of our cultural heritage, and that it provides important economic benefits to local communities. Fishing tourism, for example, can bring in significant revenue to areas that are otherwise economically disadvantaged.  Ultimately, whether or not sport fishing should be abolished is a matter of personal opinion. While there are valid arguments on both sides of the issue, it is important to consider the potential impact on fish populations, as well as the ethical implications of the practice. It is also important to consider the potential economic and cultural benefits of sport fishing, as well as the potential risks and benefits of alternative approaches to managing fish populations.

Where the trees whisper in hushed tones
And the leaves rustle with mystical rhythm
There lies a serenade unknown

A melody that sways with the wind
A symphony in the heart of the wild
A song that speaks to the soul within
And silences the mind, undefiled

As the stars twinkle in the night sky
The forest comes alive with sound
The birds join in with their sweet lullabies
And the earth vibrates with music profound

The serenade of the enchanted forest
Is a gift to those who choose to hear
A gift of grace and mystical wonder
That fills the heart with joy and cheer

So if you seek an escape from the chaos
Take refuge in the enchantment around
And let the serenade of the forest
Lull you into a peaceful sound.",1

Four walls, a roof, a home for all
A place to rest, a place to thrive
A place to keep our dreams alive

The scent of home-cooked meals and love
Lingers on, like wings of a dove

The front porch where we sit and chat
The backyard where we play and pat
The windows that let sunlight in
And the doors that keep danger thin

Through every season, come what may
Our house remains, a sturdy stay
A place of calm, a place of peace
A place where joys and sorrows cease

So let us cherish this abode
Our home, our haven, our beloved
For as long as it stands upright
The love within, will shine so bright.",1

I used to have classes about 30 or less. Right now I am happy, UT won its first football game. I'm glad I was able to go. It was lots of fun. Now I feel a little exhausted. I haven't really done all that much today. I actually got to sleep for 12 hours last night. I could be exhausted because I am hungry. I think I'm pretty lucky. My parents sent me some food.

Oh chimes set high on the sunny tower
Ring on, ring on unendingly,
Make all the hours a single hour,
For when the dusk begins to flower,
The man I love will come to me! ...
But no, go slowly as you will,
I should not bid you hasten so,
For while I wait for love to come,
Some other girl is standing dumb,
Fearing her love will go.

Oh white steam over the roofs, blow high!
Oh chimes in the tower ring clear and free!
Oh sun awake in the covered sky,
For the man I love, loves me! ...
Oh drifting steam disperse and die,
Oh tower stand shrouded toward the south,—
Fate heard afar my happy cry,
And laid her finger on my mouth.

The dusk was blue with blowing mist,
The lights were spangles in a veil,
And from the clamor far below
Floated faint music like a wail.
It voiced what I shall never speak,
My heart was breaking all night long,
But when the dawn was hard and gray,
My tears distilled into a song.

I said, “I have shut my heart
As one shuts an open door,
That Love may starve therein
And trouble me no more.”
But over the roofs there came
The wet new wind of May,
And a tune blew up from the curb
Where the street-pianos play.

And Love cried out to me,
“I am strong, I will break your heart
Unless you set me free.”",0

" Advocates of space exploration argue that the United States should invest more time, money, and effort in this field for several reasons. First, space exploration has the potential to drive technological advancements that can benefit many industries, including healthcare, telecommunications, and transportation. Second, space exploration could lead to new discoveries that could deepen our understanding of the universe and ultimately, our place in it. Third, space exploration could also bring economic benefits through the creation of new jobs and the development of new industries.  On the other hand, critics argue that the United States should not invest more time, money, and effort in space exploration, and instead focus on more pressing issues on Earth. They argue that the money spent on space exploration could be better spent on issues such as poverty, healthcare, and education. Additionally, they point out that space exploration is a risky and costly endeavor, and the potential benefits may not outweigh the costs.  Ultimately, whether or not the United States should invest more time, money, and effort in space exploration is a complex issue with no easy answer. It requires a careful consideration of the potential benefits and costs, as well as an understanding of the priorities and values of society.               ",1

" As an AI language model, I don't have a personal opinion, but I can provide information to help you form your own perspective.  In my opinion, school cafeterias should offer low-fat and vegetarian lunch options to accommodate the diverse eating habits of all students. The availability of such options is crucial as students with different dietary restrictions and preferences should be able to enjoy healthy and nutritious meals during their school day.  Firstly, providing low-fat and vegetarian options in school cafeterias can help promote healthy eating habits among students. Students who consume a healthy diet tend to perform better academically and are less likely to develop health problems in the long run. This is especially important given the rising rates of obesity and other diet-related health issues among young people.  Secondly, offering low-fat and vegetarian options is an inclusive approach that caters to the diverse needs and preferences of students. Students who follow a vegetarian diet, for instance, may feel left out or even discriminated against if there are no suitable options available for them. By offering such options, schools can create a more welcoming and inclusive environment that values diversity.  Lastly, offering low-fat and vegetarian options can also be cost-effective in the long run. A healthy diet can lead to fewer absences due to illness, which can in turn reduce healthcare costs. Additionally, by catering to the dietary needs of all students, schools can ensure that students are more likely to purchase lunch from the cafeteria, which can increase revenue for the school.  In conclusion, I believe that schools should provide low-fat and vegetarian options in their cafeterias to accommodate the diverse dietary needs and preferences of students. Doing so can promote healthy eating habits, create a more inclusive environment, and be cost-effective in the long run.           ",1

This can be true in some cases, particularly when we make impulsive decisions that have negative long-term effects.  On the other hand, living in the moment can also be beneficial for our well-being, as it allows us to fully appreciate the present and find joy in small moments. Moreover, some opportunities may only be available to us in the present moment, and postponing them may lead to regrets in the future.  Therefore, I believe that the quote can be interpreted in different ways depending on the context. While it is important to consider the long-term consequences of our actions, we should also learn to find a balance between living in the moment and planning for the future.    ",1

" The statement ""ignorance is bliss"" suggests that not knowing certain information can make one happier. While it may be true that ignorance can sometimes protect us from unpleasant truths, it can also prevent us from making informed decisions, solving problems, and taking necessary actions. For example, not knowing the risks and consequences of a particular decision can lead to poor outcomes and regrets.  Similarly, the statement ""what you don't know won't hurt you"" implies that ignorance can prevent harm. However, not knowing important information can sometimes lead to negative consequences. For instance, not knowing about a health issue or a financial risk can lead to severe consequences.  Therefore, it's essential to seek knowledge and information to make informed decisions and prevent negative consequences, rather than relying on ignorance as a source of happiness or protection.

"John Henry Walker (1831–1899), a pioneer Canadian journalist, editor and publisher, was born in London, England on November 26, 1831. He came to Canada in 1851 and worked as a printer in Toronto until he established his own publishing house, the John Henry Walker Publishing Company, in 1865.

"  Throughout history, many people have fought for various causes, some of which have had a significant impact on society. Whether it be civil rights, gender equality, or environmental sustainability, there are many issues that are worth fighting for. However, one cause that I believe is particularly important to fight for is global poverty reduction.  Poverty is a pervasive and complex issue that affects millions of people around the world. According to the World Bank, around 9.2% of the global population, or roughly 689 million people, live in extreme poverty, defined as living on less than $1.90 per day. This number is even higher when taking into account those who live just above the poverty line but still struggle to make ends meet. Poverty can lead to a host of other issues, such as hunger, malnutrition, lack of access to healthcare, and limited educational opportunities. It is a cycle that can be difficult to break out of, particularly for those living in developing countries where access to resources and opportunities is limited.  Fighting global poverty is worth the effort because it is a moral imperative. As human beings, we have a responsibility to help those who are less fortunate than ourselves. It is unjust that some people have to suffer from poverty while others have access to abundance. By fighting poverty, we are not only improving the lives of individuals, but we are also creating a more just and equitable world.  Furthermore, reducing global poverty has significant benefits for everyone, not just those who are directly affected by it. Poverty reduction leads to economic growth and stability, as it allows more people to participate in the economy and contribute to their communities. It also promotes political stability and reduces the likelihood of conflict, as people who are struggling to survive are more likely to engage in criminal or violent behavior. Additionally, poverty reduction is good for the environment, as people who are living in poverty often have to resort to harmful practices to survive, such as deforestation or overfishing.  There are many ways to fight global poverty, including through foreign aid, trade policies, and investment in education and healthcare. It requires a concerted effort from governments, non-governmental organizations, and individuals alike. It is a long-term project that requires sustained investment and commitment, but the rewards are immense.  In conclusion, fighting global poverty is a cause that is worth fighting for. It is a moral imperative that promotes justice and equity, and it has significant benefits for everyone. By reducing poverty, we can create a more stable and sustainable world. It is a long-term project that requires sustained investment and commitment, but the rewards are immense. As individuals, we can support organizations that work to reduce poverty, advocate for policies that promote poverty reduction, and educate ourselves and others about the issue. Together, we can make a difference and create a better world for all.              ",1

"College is so cool. I really can't remember the last time I felt so many emotions at the same time. I've already met so many incredible and different people I can't even begin to describe all of them. I am definately having mixed thoughts about having a boyfriend at this moment because of all the new people I have met and would definately like to meet, get to know, and date. My boyfriend is totally mad because he is so jealous. I hate jealous people I wish everyone would just, I don't know go along with it. I ate the grosests food in jester cafeteria today and had the weirdest conversation with two very interesting and cool guys that I have already met from camptexas. That was like almost the most fun I've had in a really long time I'm so glad I decided to go and wasn't to scared. I was so scared about coming to UT  because it is so big and I just didn't know if I could adjust after going to such a small catholic school. I'm so glad to be away from old people and meeting knew ones. High school was such an almost horrible experience, I hope college is so much better. So I'm in this room with these two guys, one who I met at camptexas and he looks exactly like the guy from rookie of the year he doesn't know it but I have this incredible, horrible, obssesion with him. He is just the hottest guy I have ever seen. So I met this really cool guy from tarytown in New York which is like the place I've been obssessed with since forever. He is a guy I would really like to hang out with. This other guy who is rookie of the years roomate is totally obssessed with Britany Spears I really can't stand her but I think it is just because I am so jealous that he likes her more than me. And Drew has almost naked women pictures all over his wall that makes me very jealous and I was just thinking about jealous people. The music is blasting in my ear I don't know who it is. Drew complains a lot about college ruled spirals and needing more space. I really hate that my roomate and myself don't have much in common. Everyone else seems to be like best friends with their roomates I need a really good girl friend to hang out with. Or maybe I'm just ment to have guy friends. I guess it would be okay with me I get along with  them better. I think classes are going to be really fun and not too hard. Which is really a relief because I though it would be really hard. I've seen so many interesting people. I miss my parents like crazy and my dogs and sisters. I would never trade this experience for going to UTEP that would really suck. I really miss my friend Bianca and Anne. I think for labor day we are going to San Antonio if Anne and Lianna and Vero come up. I was thinking about Noodles the other day I wonder how she is. This is got to be one of the funnest assigments I have ever done. I really think I might double major whith something in Psychology because the human mind is an incredible thing. Well my 20 minutes seem to be up that kind of sucks I guess I could really write forever I need to go write my parents and some friends e-mails and then read a little for Biology and probably go to sleep I'm really tired.",0

" It is true that American society is known for its competitive nature. This competitiveness can be seen in various aspects of life, including education, sports, business, and even personal relationships. Many people argue that this level of competition is too high and can have negative consequences.  On the one hand, competition can be a good thing. It can motivate people to work harder, push themselves to achieve more, and strive for excellence. In a competitive environment, individuals are more likely to innovate and find new ways to succeed, which can lead to progress and growth. Additionally, competition can help individuals learn valuable skills such as teamwork, leadership, and communication, which are important in both personal and professional settings.  However, on the other hand, excessive competition can also have negative effects. For one, it can create a culture of stress and anxiety, as individuals feel pressure to constantly perform at high levels. This can lead to burnout and mental health issues, such as depression and anxiety. Additionally, competition can create a winner-takes-all mentality, where only a few individuals are able to succeed while the rest are left behind. This can result in inequality and a lack of social mobility, particularly in areas such as education and the job market.  In conclusion, American society is indeed known for its competitiveness, and while competition can have its benefits, it can also have negative consequences. It is up to individuals and society as a whole to strike a balance between healthy competition and excessive pressure, and to work towards creating a more equitable and inclusive society.

"I went to my sorority's crush party last night. I didn't really know what to expect because they had it at Buffalo Club and I don't dance, I don't smoke, and I certainly don't look 21. At any rate, I wasn't having very much fun after 30 minutes. At that point a guy came up to me and asked me to dance, I figured it couldn't be any worse than standing around so I said yes. We ended up hanging around with each other the entire evening. We exchanged phone numbers and I kind of figured that was the end of it. It was about twelve-thirty when I drank half of my ""big sister's"" Long Island Iced Tea and I have to say I think that it really impaired my judgement. I got talked into going to Dance Across with three of my sorority sisters and the guy who had been hanging around me. I had fun, we danced, but he isn't exactly the kind of guy I'm particularly attracted to. For some reason I put that aside, became extremely flirtatious, and even let him French kiss me after having met him only four hours before. I feel really cheap now, I never do things like that. I don't really know what the reason for my actions was (I'm blaming it on the drink, but that's probably not the problem because the effects had worn off before the end of the evening). Maybe I'm somewhat lonely, it's been about three months since I've had a boyfriend. The problem is that I woke up this morning and regretted last night. I feel like I used this guy, I didn't mean to. Maybe it's not that I don't want a boyfriend, maybe it's that I don't want him as a boyfriend. The worst thing about this is that I've been in his position before (having someone kiss me than decide they don't want me, in fact, it was last week) but it hurt my feelings and I think it's extremely insensitive of me to do the same thing to someone else.",0
"Moluccans are the Austronesian-speaking and Papuan-speaking ethnic groups inhabiting the Maluku Islands. The term ""Moluccan"" is an umbrella term that covers the various Austronesian and Papuan languages spoken on the islands. The largest group of Moluccans are the Tolo-speaking people.  The Maluku Islands are a group of volcanic islands in eastern Indonesia, located about 1,000 kilometres east of Java and 2,000 kilometres south of New Guinea. The islands comprise over 700 islands, with a total land area of approximately 245,000 square kilometres. They have a population of around 1 million people, most of whom are Muslim. The largest island group is the Tolo-speaking region, which comprises over 60% of the population.  The Moluccas were first explored by Europeans in 1512. Portuguese explorer João da Nova discovered Ternate and Tidore, while Dutch explorer Jacob Roggeveen discovered Halmahera and Bougainville.

"  In my opinion, a good education should be considered a fundamental right for everyone, not a privilege for a select few. There are several reasons why I hold this belief.  Firstly, education is essential for personal and societal development. It equips individuals with the knowledge and skills they need to be productive members of society and to contribute to the progress of their community. A good education not only helps people secure better-paying jobs and build successful careers but also enables them to make informed decisions and participate fully in the democratic process.  Secondly, education is a key factor in reducing poverty and inequality. Access to quality education can help break the cycle of poverty and open up opportunities for marginalized groups. By providing equal access to education for all individuals, regardless of their socioeconomic status, we can create a more just and equitable society.  Lastly, education is a right recognized by the United Nations. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1948, states that everyone has the right to education. This includes the right to free, compulsory primary education, and access to secondary and tertiary education. As such, it is the responsibility of governments and societies to ensure that this right is upheld.  In conclusion, a good education is a right, not a privilege. Access to quality education is essential for personal and societal development, reducing poverty and inequality, and upholding fundamental human rights. It is our collective responsibility to ensure that every individual has access to a good education, regardless of their background or circumstances.      ",1

"The sky wants the water to turn grey,
but if I notice how waves
play with the clumps of yellow flags,
or the way turtles share logs,
or even try to understand a friend’s decision
to walk onto a glacier
and end her life—I will be ready
for any poems that have been waiting.
The horizon opens as I walk,
escorted by swans and Canada geese.
I need to stop backpedaling into the present.
In my old life people would straighten
the truth, but the river
flows in curves.
The names of my father and my mother
rest next to each other in Greenwood Cemetery.
The distance between me and the mountains
measures an uneven thought: I feel like an orphan.
An early moon is just a piece of change
in the softening sky.
Light is such an actress. Time to seek
Hopper’s wish to simply paint sunlight
on the wooden wall of a house. I am growing
older. Maru in Japanese means
the ship
will make it back home.",0
"last night I laid down and I Couldn't go to sleep for anything. sleep would be nice right now, I have class all day today. my classes are pretty cool though. I have music psychology and ceramics. I'm good at ceramics though cause I got grounded a lot in high school. high school was fun. I have a lot of great memories. I miss my friends sometimes, but it was time to move on. I feel more free, no one knows you or anything you can do what you want and be who you are. I am finally realizing the value of that too. I think its the art . I love art its constantly running thorough my head. The way I look at everything, the way I find beauty and perspective in simple and complex things, the way I am so attracted to things that are gorgeous. not only on the outside but personalities for example and music. I am going to incubus on Wednesday and they are brilliant. its cool too cause my homework for music class is to go to a concert anyways. my music class meets too often . 4 days a week. that shit is ridiculous. I feel like I am taking 15 hours but I'm just taking 12, which allows for a job. I am going to work at the frank Erwin center hopefully . I was a waitress this summer at el Chico. I love Mexican food. I am so damn hungry right now. oops can I cuss? oh well. my stomach is rumbling and I felt it necessary. I feel tired and hungry and event the sound of punching these keys is annoying but the relief of finishing this assignment is un-explainable believe me. lately I've been dead set on being responsible and I am hell bent on making all A's , so when I can make a check on the 'old to do list, its like its lifted from my shoulders and that no joke. my back hurts so bad every day from stress. its actually kind of funny that in class we talked about the correlation between stress and the immune system because I was stressed to hell the first couple weeks of school and a couple of weeks before with bills and work and money , etc. and I could not get over a dinky little cold for 3 weeks, and now that I've gotten into the scheme of things its so much easier. its so much easier just being a sophomore in general. I remember when I moved into the dorms my freshmen year. we moved everything in and I remember after my dad left standing there looking around. I had no phone, no friends, and no clue and I think it was the scariest moment of reality in my life. but when I look back I have learned that you can't always know everything at that second. you have to give yourself time to grow and learn and not be so anxious to know it all. what is this an autobiography? I don't know I am just writing as I go along. I like to write. I write often actually, sort of like this but mainly about things no one but me cares about. I like to vent, I NEED to vent. its almost like when I write something down it jumps from my mind and onto the paper and is no longer stressing me out. I don't know maybe I'm weird. I wish I could find really unique ways of expressing myself, so I do poetry as well. but I am getting bored with this subject so lets jump to another. how about love? I am in love. I am not quick to say that either and it is not something I was trying to do or even wanted, but I have found  my soul mate believe  it or not. he is perfect, and believe me I am not naive. he is the most unique person in the world ( maybe its the ADHD ) and I love his mind because I appreciate things I cannot understand myself or find how its done, and he fascinates me. really all I want is to be fascinated, and to laugh. I love to laugh. you know those times when you just laugh your ass off so hard you cry. man that's the best. seriously. that's why I like to surround myself with people who make me laugh. I make myself laugh too. I am quite lonely during the day and end up having to entertain my head with humorous thoughts. or just dress weird and laugh inside when people give me weird looks. I love that.",0

" I do not have personal preferences or biases. However, I can provide you with some objective information to help you make a decision between leasing or buying a new car based on your financial situation, driving habits, and preferences.  Leasing a car may be a better option if you prefer to drive a new car every few years and do not want to deal with the hassle of selling your vehicle. Lease payments are generally lower than car loan payments, and you can often get a higher-end vehicle for the same monthly payment as a lower-end car purchase. Additionally, you may have lower repair costs since the vehicle is usually covered under warranty during the lease term. However, keep in mind that you will not own the car at the end of the lease term, and there may be additional fees for excess mileage or wear and tear.  Buying a new car may be a better option if you want to own your vehicle outright and keep it for a longer period. With a car loan, you can spread out the cost of the vehicle over several years and may end up paying less in interest than you would with a lease. You also have more flexibility in terms of customization and modifications to the car. However, you may face higher repair costs once the vehicle is no longer covered under warranty, and you will have to deal with selling or trading in the vehicle when you are ready for a new one.  Ultimately, the decision between leasing or buying a new car depends on your personal circumstances and preferences. Consider your budget, driving habits, and long-term goals before making a decision. You may also want to consult with a financial advisor to determine the best option for your specific situation.

"Today is Friday and I am feeling sad because my I had been hoping to see my boyfriend Justin this weekend. Actually, originally I had planned to see him next weekend because this weekend he was supposed to be going to La Grange. But then his trip to La Grange got cancelled and I was hoping that he would be able to come up and visit me. But it just wasn't going to happen in this short of notice because we had too many other things going on this weekend. But next weekend I will see him because I am driving down to Houston next Friday. I am so excited because by then it will have been three weeks since we last saw eachother. Next Sunday, September 15 is his brothers' birthday. He has two brothers, they are twins. Their names are Jack and John. They will be turning 11. This weekend I am going to buy them birthday cards. The only problem is that I'm not sure which name to put on one of the cards because now John wants to be called Hunter for no particular reason. So I want to be nice and call him by the name he wants to be called, but I also think that those kind of nicknames are dumb. By that I mean nicknames that are derived from nowhere. A nickname should contain at least some semblance of the person's actual name. But I want to be nice to his brother. I am very tired right now. I didn't get enough sleep last night, I stayed up late talking to my roommate about the most random stuff. I had planned to take a nap after my 10:00 class, but I got sidetracked, and I had that guilty feeling that I should be studying. So I went to the library and studied a little bit. And now it is 3:00 on Friday afternoon and I really have nothing to do. That has been a common theme during my two-week college experience so far: having nothing to do. My roommate is one of my best friends from high school, and all senior year we were so excited about coming to college. And I really like it here a lot, but I guess it takes awhile for things to pick up. But I have been meeting a lot of people in the dorm and some people in my classes. At first I was unbelievably homesick, it came in waves. I'd be ok for awhile, and then all of a sudden something would remind me of Justin or home or my parents or something and I'd feel like I wanted to cry. Now that things have settled into sort of a routine I feel better. And I know it just takes time. I can sort of gauge everything that happens to me during college to what happened to my brother, because when he started college he was in the same situation I am in - he was in a long distance relationship. But he went to A&M. Also, his girlfriend was still in high school, and my boyfriend is the same age as me. But he was miserable, I remember how sad he was. He used to come home every weekend. But he was in College Station, only about an hour from home. Anyways, I wouldn't even want to be like that. I don't want to seem like I can't handle things and I have to run back to Justin all the time. But I really miss him and I have this lost feeling, like I'm not sure what to do with myself. My roommate went downstairs to get her laundry. She had a little package slip in the mail too. Justin said that I should check my mail today and I did, but I didn't get anything, so I don't know what he's talking about. It's a very cloudy day today. I am supposed to do this homework assignment for my astronomy class where I have to observe the sky and measure the angles of different stars. So I hope it clears off later. The other problem is I can't find a place from where I can do it. At first I thought I would just go to the top of the Jester parking Garage, so I did that last night, but it wasn't tall enough - I couldn't see the horizon behind all the tall buildings and stuff. So I'm not sure exactly what I'm going to do about it. It is actually stressing me out, because I just don't know what to do. I hope I will figure out something this weekend. The homework is not due until Thursday. But I'd rather get it over with. My roommate just came back and said that I did have a letter from Justin. That is weird because I checked the mail earlier and there was nothing for me. So I'm excited now. Now she is folding her laundry. I did my laundry yesterday. It is so expensive, 75 cents a load. That is why I'm going to take my laundry home next weekend.",0
"  From a societal point of view, paternity leave policies can have several advantages. Firstly, they promote gender equality by recognizing the importance of fathers' role in raising children. Secondly, they allow fathers to bond with their newborns, which can strengthen the parent-child relationship and benefit the child's emotional and cognitive development. Additionally, paternity leave can also reduce the burden on mothers who may otherwise have to take care of the newborn on their own.  On the other hand, some people argue that paternity leave policies could have negative consequences for employers. For example, they could increase the cost of labor or decrease productivity if a critical employee is absent. Moreover, some argue that paternity leave policies could lead to discrimination against men, particularly if they are seen as less committed to their careers.  Overall, it's important to weigh the potential benefits and drawbacks of paternity leave policies and consider the long-term impact they may have on society, families, and businesses.         ",1

A nightmare come alive,

"Yes, I wanted them to levitate.
Unfortunately, I hadn't a leg to stand on.
Cut-out camels plodded across the blackboard's high
sill. Yet the desert below refused to unfurl its
mica wings. When I asked them to try to remember,
to release a soap bubble from their marvelous arsenal
of wands, they resisted. They lined up, suspicious
in individual spotlights. The fountain inside
the scissored palm could only rise so high,
maybe just a trumpeted C. Which is high, but
not like those huge blue dreams that used to float by,
shot from cloud-atomizers, the original public breeze
on its back in the grass. Let's try to guess who
or what is being borne up by this caravan of thin-
skinned humps, a-bulge, inoculated? I tell you
every one has a rider, a crop. It's been done
this way for some time. If we pause here by the pillars
of sand, up to our poet-knees in anarchy, won't each
gulp of hoarded water from the toppled monument be
sweeter passed hand to hand in the sun-colored dipper?
Up to our thighs in it now, and spared what drills it-
self into the rock daily, so it can claim to know zero
after zero, and make that nothing into a sound like
silent bells, split parched hooves, plodding.",0

"Nick Albertson (born 1983, Boston, MA) is a Chicago-based artist. Themes  Primarily utilizing a Toyo-Field 45CF 4-by-5 camera, Nick Albertson's  work combines photography, video, and sculptural forms. Albertson's recent body of work utilizes the repetitive patterning of everyday household items such as rubber bands, cups, straws, paper napkins, and plastic bags. When framed through Nick Albertson's photographic lens, these mundane objects undergo a transformation. Through patterning, light and shadow, sculptural formations, and post-production editing, Albertson's work blurs the lines between abstraction and representation, playing to the repetitive nature of the objects in question and the viewer's familiarity with common household products. ""In my work, I strip utilitarian objects of their functions, repurposing them to create visceral experiences."" One reviewer noted that in some of Albertson's works, it is obvious to tell which household or office item he is utilizing in his works. Others, not so much. The repeated motif leads towards abstraction in a way that is both mesmerizing and deceptive.",0

"I just don't understand why things didn't work out. How can you honestly be so mean. I thought that you loved me. I loved you. I still love you. What went wrong?  I can't remember what went wrong last semester, but I am sure you would remind me if you had to. Gaw this song by John Mayer reminds me of you. Our love was so comfortable, so broken in. ""  Why did my parents disapprove of you and us?  Are you really that bad?  Are you really not that good for me?  I thought I could trust my own emotions. Why don't my parents trust me?  Or is it even a trust issue. Can I really not love at such a young age?  Ug. So many questions running through my mind. Why are you all I think about?  Wow, I wonder if this is obsessive. How do you even spell that darn word. Haha. Why do I always think in question form. Man, I want to go see you so bad. I really think I am coming for your birthday. But am I going to regret it?  Gaww, everyone tells me not to go. But they should take their own advise sometimes. I mean they don't even think the Bible is real. Sometimes I feel like I am the only one who believes in God. How can I trust my friends advice when they don't even believe the same thing I do!  If only I knew what God wanted for me. Talk about a stressful time. I never knew college would be so difficult. Academically I figured it would be but emotionally. Wow. Its incredible how much I have already changed. For the better?  I hope. I think I have though. I just wish I had you back Robert. I wish things could be like they used to. Why did you even call and apologize for everything you did wrong?  I know you still love me. Why do you even want me to come see you?  Do you want to be back with me?  I know you don't. Or do you ? You have fun being single. Why can't I?  Why can't I meet someone else to take my mind off of you. Are you the one?  Man, should I even be thinking like this at 20?  Ha. Maybe I am weird. Oh well. This song is extremely depressing. I am glad my roommates aren't here or they would be making fun of me for listening to it. Get over Robert Kimberly! Get over him!  If only  they knew I am trying, so hard. Gosh, its not like I have not prayed every night for Gods help. I mean geeze. I don't think he is suppose to be out of my life. But then if he is not, why was he so mean to me. I would have never done that to him. Never hurt him for anything. I guess I am a door mat. Its not that I let people walk all over me, its just that I don't ever want anyone to feel what I have. Why would I ever let anyone hurt on purpose?  If I had to choose between myself experiencing hurt and someone else, I would take the hurt in a second. I hate seeing people suffer. I will suffer before anyone I love does. So does that make me a door mat. Am I really too forgiving?  People can change. Or is that my fantasy world. I want to be with you Robert. So why can't I?  Because of my parents?  Yeah right. I can make my own decisions. Gaw, am I really that immature too?  No!  I am very mature for my age. He was always there for me when I needed him the most. He was my shoulder to cry on. Yeah last year was tough and I may have been to needy and dependent on him. But the break up made me realize that and now I am not as dependent. I am fine without him and I realized I have to  make myself happy. So why does not he want to be with me now?  Does he?  He calls me all the time. Tells me he loves me and misses me. Wow I thought girls were complicated. Lol. That is why I need to see him. I need to read his eyes. The second he looks at me I will be able to tell what he feels without him even saying anything. I am good at that. I can read people easy. I get it from mom. Man she can see right though me. So then why couldn't she see how special Robert was for me. Gosh, I should seriously be thinking about something else other than him. Like school. Hehe. That is more important. But then he is too. He is everything I want in a husband when he is good. I mean he has his flaws but don't we all. Forgive and forget. That is what I do. That is what Pastor Ball said yesterday. You have to forgive a person to enjoy them again. Well, I have forgiven everyone I know. Why can Robert be forgiven. Why can't they let him be apart of my life. I get so angry when I think about it all. I love you parents, but man you really messed up this time. I  have forgiven you for it. So forgive Robert. Geeze, my hands are starting to hurt. Lol. Not used to this much typing. Its like he is a disease. I can't get rid of him in my mind. Now that is unhealthy. But I can push you aside when I need to. Like tonight, way to much homework to dwell on him. Yeah that is what messed me up last semester. To emotionally involved. But this semester I am so much better. I have control over my life again. Yeah!  But I just can't get upset if things don't go my way. I mean life has its ups and downs. And its not Robert that I need in my life. I just need to keep God in my life and He will help me. But then again I wouldn't mind having Robert too. Hehe.",0

Her work was significant to the development of Paris Dada and modernism and her drawings and collages explore fascinating gender dynamics. Due to the fact that she was a woman in the male prominent Dada movement, she was rarely considered an artist in her own right. She constantly lived in the shadows of her famous older brothers, who were also artists, or she was referred to as ""the wife of."" Her work in painting turns out to be significantly influential to the landscape of Dada in Paris and to the interests of women in Dada. She took a large role as an avant-garde artist, working through a career that spanned five decades, during a turbulent time of great societal change. She used her work to express certain subject matter such as personal concerns about modern society, her role as a modern woman artist, and the effects of the First World War. Her work often weaves painting, collage, and language together in complex ways. Early life and education  Suzanne was born in Blainville-Crevon, Seine-Maritime in the Haute-Normandie Region of France, near Rouen.

Like golden sunshine on a spring
It fills me up and makes me sing
A feeling that forever clings

Oh, the happiness it brings
To my heart and soul it sings

That spreads across the sky aglow
A treasure from above bestowed
This precious gift that often flows

It paints my life with vivid hues
A blissful journey that ensues
With every smile, joy renews
And fills my being with pure views

Like morning dew on grass anew
It makes me whole and never grew
A love that forever stays in view

So come my way, dear joy
And fill my life with pleasures and no ploy
With every breath, let me enjoy
And sing your praises forevermore with joy!",1

"Thaumaci or Thaumacus , was a town in ancient Arcadia, in the territory of Pheneus. It was situated on the river Acheron, about two stadia from the sea-shore, and about four from the river Alpheus. Thucydides mentions it as one of the towns in which the Peloponnesian War was chiefly carried on.  Thaumaci flourished under the government of Aristodemus, who appears to have been its founder and first ruler. Its extent is not accurately known, but it seems to have been small; for Thucydides says that it contained only two hundred houses, while Pliny puts its population at seven thousand five hundred. Thucydides also mentions that there were two temples in it, one to Apollo and the other to Hermes Trismegistus.  The town was captured by Antiochus III in 188 BC, after a long siege, and was subsequently destroyed.",1

Pretending I am flying

that that family is my family, crying out in pain,
thin daisies bent flat in a summer wind.

why nothing is easy in this world with its reasons.

Your spouse the painting?

From having less or from wanting more?

She wakes up knowing that she doesn’t want less.

woman. I love her more than sharks love blood.”

Is this because it’s a debt that must be paid for
not believing in somebody?
In herself?
She felt the desire of desire as if it was a binchōtan
charcoal and its ash.

On Easter Sunday, she sang a Christmas carol of Lao Tzu.
Lao Tzu, where is your power to persuade a tree from falling
asleep on itself?
Does night dream of actresses sleeping on leaves?
Where is the human figure in this?
Your Saturday is a memory without a body.
A pair of lungs that knew too much about your mother’s rape
tells you to leave reality through a threshold of a dream.
You knew how to be authentic. How to get rid of people.
How desertion works in the wilderness.
You exclude sound from your thesis.
It’s a way for you to desert poetry without being too poetic.

There were thistles inside of your mother’s vaginal canal.
She wasn’t violated in the wilderness. He has dragged her there to
say that it was okay to want pins and needles. She wasn’t numbed
after all. Her body didn’t pretend to be a God. Just a whimpered
Lao Tzu.
In a remote mountain, the men are smoking pipes and their vapors
smell like evergreen.
To punctuate their desire she says: God is being difficult. But he is
not.
I have to tell the world that I am sad and have been forgotten. Is
there a way home from not being homeless? Is there a way to swim
in an Indian reservation without being caught?
Listen: the isotope was just a trope.
There are ways to move smoothly in and out of insincerity.
We grow to learn how to brush melted butter
onto doughs shaped like the cavalry.
They arrive galloping on the baking
sheets without yeast in their armors.

Every Tuesday we acquire clues from the shape
of your mother’s scream.
When it was hoarse, it had the shape of a small bonsai tree.
Your cat licks you and licks you.
You know it’s not 300 bc.
Desire comes and goes while leaving lies to clothe themselves.
Her anger is a troublesome candidate of sadness—
lights itself on fire.
From time to time, the cunt of that fire grows ember by ember.
Once in a while, a house made of screams floats down a black river
on the planet Pluto.
Its chimney is not designed to ventilate silence or resilience.
It’s designed to allow screams to escape without suffocating
everyone inside it.
Once in a while the rain arrives to suppress the anger of the
scream.
When anger soaks like wet grasses on the house’s floorboard, the
ants come out to showcase their military might.
They resurrected the screams from their wet ash and carry them
on their powerful backs.
The aftermath of a rape is portable and transmutable.
A possible somatic experience for the ants, but may not be for the
human or the inhuman.",0

"Laughter, the sweet sound that fills the air
Bringing joy, dispelling despair
A melody that lifts the human soul
A symphony that makes us whole

It starts with a feeling deep inside
As a smile forms and our eyes widen in delight
We let out a sound that echoes with glee
And suddenly, all worries flee

Laughter is a language everyone knows
No matter what race, gender or religion shows
It can break down walls that divide us all
Uniting us in a single call

The power of laughter is truly profound
It heals hearts and lifts us off the ground
It brings light to darkened days
And fills our hearts with love and grace

So let us laugh as often as we can
And share this gift with every woman and man
For laughter is contagious and truly divine
A blessing that will forever shine.",1
"Love is a feeling that cannot be tamed,
A flame that burns and cannot be blamed.
It's a rush of emotions, like fireworks in the sky,
A journey that is taken, with no reason to lie.

Love is an adventure, so wild and exciting,
A bittersweet symphony, constantly inviting.
It's the gentle touch, and the tender kiss,
The promise of forever, that we cannot dismiss.

Love is a dance, with steps so intricate,
The beats of our hearts, so passionate and deliberate.
It's the beating of drums, the rhythm of life,
The melody that we feel, in the stillness of night.

Love is a combination, of joy and of pain,
A whisper of comfort, in times of disdain.
It's the laughter and tears, the high and the low,
The bond that never breaks, no matter how much we grow.

Love is a feeling that we cannot ignore,
The sweetest of all, the most precious of all.
It's the reason we were created, to feel and to give,
For it is true that with love, we truly can live.",1

"All hail to the Rev. George Gilfillan of Dundee, He is the greatest preacher I did ever hear or see. He is a man of genius bright, And in him his congregation does delight, Because they find him to be honest and plain, Affable in temper, and seldom known to complain. He preaches in a plain straightforward way, The people flock to hear him night and day, And hundreds from the doors are often turn’d away, Because he is the greatest preacher of the present day. He has written the life of Sir Walter Scott, And while he lives he will never be forgot, Nor when he is dead, Because by his admirers it will be often read; And fill their minds with wonder and delight, And wile away the tedious hours on a cold winter’s night. He has also written about the Bards of the Bible, Which occupied nearly three years in which he was not idle, Because when he sits down to write he does it with might and main, And to get an interview with him it would be almost vain, And in that he is always right, For the Bible tells us whatever your hands findeth to do, Do it with all your might. Rev. George Gilfillan of Dundee, I must conclude my muse, And to write in praise of thee my pen does not refuse, Nor does it give me pain to tell the world fearlessly, that when You are dead they shall not look upon your like again.",0
"Right now I am realizing how tired I am after such a long day of work. I worked all day today and I think I have sneezed at least 100 times. I wonder if I have allergies. My kitten is crawling across the keyboard. Man, do I type really slow or what. I probably won't be able to type very much in 20 minutes. I am really frustrated with by boyfriend right now. I think that must be a ""woman thing. "" I don't know. Maybe I am a little hard on him. I don't know. I just really wish he could be more open with me a communicate with me better. I really wish he would tell me how he truly feels about me and about us. I am so frustrated with it all. I be psychologists get a lot of complaints about men from us women. I am really sure of that. I am really realizing that men don't communicate very well about relationships. Unless you are talking about football or cars, you might as well forget. it. I really don't know how to take his comment this weekend that he likes cars better than he likes women. I really take offense to that comment. I really think that that is personally directed to me. I don't know. I know he is not sure about us and I pray all the time that he will know how he feels about things and us, but so far that prayer is sill out there. I really don't know what to do now. I am not trying to make him choose me or hit the road, but I just don't want this to drag on for five years of my life and then end. I just don't want to waste any more time in my life. I know if I would have stayed with my high school boyfriend, we would probably be married by now and maybe even be happy, but things never felt complete with him and I am so glad that I realized that back then. With Stephen, things feel so much more real and I really think that is why things have seemed so much harder. We have been through a lot this past year together. With my whole surgery and illness, he sure was great. A lot of men that might have to deal with a sick girlfriend going through surgery and IV treatments would run and never look back. Not him. Thankfully God gave him the patience to put up with me and stick things out with me and help me get through such a trying time. This past year really has been a trying one. I was in the hospital numerous times, had about 8 inches of my small and large intestines removed, went through a four month new IV treatment and all at the same time tried to find a medication that would help keep my body in remission. I am thankful that I am now in the remission that I have longed for and I think my doctor has found a successful dosage and mixture of medications that are helping keep me stable. God has answered so may prayers and is continuing to watch over me. Being sick has really opened my eyes to a lot and helped me grow so much as a person. I really have had to grow up dealing with such a horrible illness. Its really hard being 21 dealing with a chronic illness that you know there is no cure for and having to deal with it daily, either by pain or medications or doctors. I think I am down to taking about 17 pills a day now. I was taking about 25. Stephen said I would jiggle when I walked. I think I still do. My doctor is continuing to decrease my medications thankfully. Looking at the clock my time is up. Hope this doesn't bore you too much. Take care!",0

Warming my skin and bringing cheer
Your rays caress the earth below
And make the flowers bloom and grow

With golden beams you light the sky
A glowing orb that's full of pride
You rise up early, bold and strong
And linger late, as if to prolong

The joy and happiness you bring
To every living thing
A symbol of hope and life
In times of joy and strife

Oh sun, you are a wonder to behold
A gift from nature, pure and bold
As you light our way and touch our soul
Our hearts are filled, and we are made whole.",1
"Abbott districts are school districts in New Jersey that are provided remedies to ensure that their students receive public education in accordance with the state constitution. They were created in 1985 as a result of the first ruling of Abbott v. Burke, a case filed by the Education Law Center. The ruling asserted that public primary and secondary education in poor communities throughout the state was unconstitutionally substandard.  The Abbott II ruling in 1990 had the most far-reaching effects, ordering the state to fund the (then) 28 Abbott districts at the average level of the state's wealthiest districts. The Abbott District system was replaced in 2007 by the New Jersey Schools Development Authority. There are now 31 ""Abbott districts"" in the state, which are now referred to as ""SDA Districts"" based on the requirement for the state to cover all costs for school building and renovation projects in these districts under the supervision of the New Jersey Schools Development Authority. The term ""Abbott district"" is still in common use since the Abbott districts receive very high funding levels for K-12 and are the only districts in New Jersey where the state pays for Pre-K for all students.",0
" Historically, there have been successful leaders who were both loved and feared. However, it is essential to consider the context and situation in which the leader operates. In some cases, being feared may be more effective, while in others, being loved may be the better approach.  Leaders who are feared often use intimidation, punishment, and the threat of consequences to maintain control over their subordinates. While this approach can be effective in the short term, it can also create a hostile work environment that can ultimately harm the organization's long-term success. Moreover, this type of leadership style can lead to a lack of trust and respect among the team members, which can negatively impact team morale, creativity, and productivity.  On the other hand, leaders who are loved often build a culture of trust, respect, and teamwork. They create a positive work environment by showing empathy, compassion, and concern for their team members. This approach often results in a more motivated and productive workforce, which can lead to higher levels of success for the organization in the long run.  In conclusion, the question of whether a leader should be loved or feared is not straightforward. Ultimately, the most effective leadership style will depend on the situation, the organization, and the people being led. A leader who can balance both approaches and adapt their leadership style to the situation will likely be the most successful.          ",1

"Estelle Liebling (April 21, 1880 – September 25, 1970) was an American soprano, composer, arranger, music editor, and celebrated voice teacher and vocal coach. Born into the Liebling family of musicians, she began her professional opera career in Dresden as a leading coloratura soprano in 1898 when she was just 18 years old. She sang with several important opera houses in Europe, including the Opéra-Comique, the Semperoper, and the Staatsoper Stuttgart. From 1902 to 1904 she was committed to the Metropolitan Opera, and from 1902 to 1905 she toured internationally in more than 1,600 concerts with John Philip Sousa and his band. After her marriage in 1906, she performed only occasionally in the succeeding two decades. Liebling began her teaching career in the 1910s, not stopping until her death more than 50 years later. Her pedagogy was rooted in the tradition of her teacher Mathilde Marchesi. She mainly taught out of her private studio in New York City, with the exception of three years working on the faculty of the Curtis Institute of Music in the 1930s. During her career she was the vocal coach or voice teacher of 78 principal singers at the Met. Many of her students were famous singers and entertainers or other public figures, including sopranos Beverly Sills, Amelita Galli-Curci, Maria Jeritza, and Margaret Truman; baritone Titta Ruffo; Wagnerian tenor Max Lorenz; actresses Adele Astaire, Kitty Carlisle, Joan Crawford, Gertrude Lawrence and Meryl Streep; socialite Irene Mayer Selznick, and the ""Queen of Hollywood gossip"" Louella Parsons.",0
"There's a feeling deep within,
I feel it every now and then,
It makes my heart skip a beat,
This feeling that's hard to defeat.

It's like a mix of joy and pain,
Like sunshine after rain,
It's something I can't quite explain,
This feeling that's hard to contain.

It's like a million butterflies,
Fluttering in my soul and eyes,
It's a mix of euphoria and fear,
This feeling that's always near.

It's like standing on the edge,
Wishing to soar, but holding a wedge,
It's a feeling that's bittersweet,
A feeling that's hard to meet.

It's like the wind in my hair,
The scent of the ocean air,
A feeling that's pure and true,
This feeling that's hard to construe.

It's like a puzzle with no rhyme,
A melody without a chime,
A feeling I wish I could define,
This feeling that's always mine.",1

"I am curious on why we need to do this assignment. Is it some sort of test? Or experiment? Well I guess I have to do it any way, so. I'm think that it is late and that damn pretesting takes to much time to just answer the same questions reworded ten times each. I hope my show in San Antonio goes well Wednesday I hope those assheads advertised this time but if not we still get paid. But that's still bad business. I really like the Common Sense album I think I'll burn a copy from sterling. I wonder what my roommates are up to? Probably just sleeping since they all have early class in the morning. My earliest class is Spanish and I dread going to that class. Man it takes up most of my schedule and if I don't do well it will bring my grade down big time, but crap like that happens. At least I can still be a frigging rockstar ha if all else fails. Which isn't looking so bad or hard by today's standards. One hit song will get you paid for life and all I hit songs needs is radio play. NO heart felt lyrics; no emotion, no good beat, and no moveable beat at all even just radio play. If you make it on TRL your set damn we played with Papa Roach and there were probably 700 people at the show the next week they were on TRL and now they could probably sell out a 10,000seat venue easy. I'm not putting them down they are a good band but that just goes to show you how the industry works. One of these days I'll be on top though no doubt. My band plays with a new band or a go to see a new band play ever week and half of them have no stage presence of any show what so ever. And if the crowd is not interested you can sell your total package to them. You can be a band that gets lots of radio play, but if you can get the crowd moving on tour your going to just sparkle and fade. My only fear is I'll be a 30yearold man with kids and still be hunting for this illusive dream and I really don't want to be in that boat. I assume I'll know when the ship has sailed and I'll just except it and move on not swim after it just to sink deeper. Only time will tell though, if nothing else I had my days in the spot light but if my 15 minutes of fame are already up I'm going to be one upset greedy bastard trying to get my hand on just a little more. I guess I've talked about my dream of being a musician enough so I'll move on to my goals at school, which as you can tell are of lesser importance right now. Not to say they are not important it just my dreams cloud my reality and sometimes it hard to see what I need to do rather what I want to do. SO my time is up and I'll see you in class Thursday.",0

Painting the world in fiery hues
A symphony of colors, a vibrant tease
As nature prepares for its winter blues

The trees let go, with a gentle sigh
As leaves fall and float on the wind
A graceful dance, with no reason why
But beauty in its every spin

The sun shines bright, a warm embrace
As golden leaves rustle and sway
A moment of magic, a fleeting grace
A memory to cherish and replay

In this season of change, there's a peaceful rhythm
A time to slow down and enjoy
The golden leaves remind us of freedom
And the beauty that lies in letting go.",1

A vast and wondrous place to roam
From mountain peaks to ocean deeps
This world we share, it never sleeps

The forests whisper in the breeze
Their beauty stirring all who sees
And rivers flowing to the sea

To dive in the deep blue ocean

And explore the hidden secrets, with devotion

A place that makes my heart thunder

I'll visit this place and cherish forever

And my heart will sing, forever and ever.",1
"Why not write something for those
who scratched out improbable livings here?
Someone has managed to sow
This broken field with stones, it appears,
So someone’s scratching it still,
Although that Japanese knotweed has edged
The tilth. Two wasps in the child
Attempt to catch sun on a rail of the bridge.
The old local doctor has passed
At almost a full decade past ninety.
He never seemed depressed.
Seventy now, if barely,
I consider the field again:
Someone will drag these rocks away
But they’ll be back. The air smells like rain,
Which is fine, the summer’s been much too dry.
Nothing is left of the barn
But some rusty steel straps in some nasty red osier.
The stone fence still looks sound,
But even there the knotweed steps over.
Hadn’t I pledged an elegy
To the old ones who worked here? You couldn’t claim
They thrived, exactly, but maybe
They likewise scented good wind full of rain,
Lifted eyes above this old orchard
To the cloud-darkened hills and found their support
Somehow, somewhere. No matter,
They kept going until they could go no more.
The trees’ puckered apples have gathered
A flock of birds, and as they alight,
They’re full of unseasonable chatter,
As if to say that all will be right.
The old ones I promised a poem
Must have said it too. It’ll be all right.
I never knew them. They’re gone.
I say it out loud, It’ll be all right.

She is best known for her plays, which explore the tensions and contradictions of identity in contemporary Singapore. Wong has been described as ""one of Singapore's most accomplished and celebrated playwrights"" and her work has been critically acclaimed both in her home country and abroad.  Wong was born in 1964 in Singapore to a Hakka Chinese father and a mother of Tamil descent. She was raised in the Singaporean city of Redhill, where she attended the Anglo-Chinese School.

The brightly-painted horse
Had a boy’s face,
And four small wheels
Under his feet,
Plus a long string
To pull him by this way and that
Across the floor,
Should you care to.
A string in-waiting
That slipped away
In many wiles
From each and every try.
2
Knock and they’ll answer,
Mother told me.
So I climbed four flights of stairs
And went in unannounced.
And found a small wooden toy
For the taking
In the ensuing emptiness
And the fading daylight
That still gives me a shudder
As if I held the key to mysteries in my hand.

Where’s the Lost and Found Department,
And the quiet entry,
The undeveloped film
Of the few clear moments
Of our blurred lives?
Where’s the drop of blood
And the teeny nail
That pricked my finger
As I bent down to touch the toy
And caught its eye?

Evening light,
Make me a Sunday
Go-to meeting shadow
For my toy.
My dearest memories are
Steep stair-wells
In dusty buildings
On dead-end streets,
Where I talk to the walls
And closed doors
As if they understood me.

The wooden toy sitting pretty.
No, quieter than that.
Like the sound of eyebrows
Raised by a villain
In a silent movie.Psst, someone said behind my back.",0
"I have been asked to do this psychology assignment of writing down my train of thoughts and feelings for twenty minutes with out stopping. So far that was my first train of thought  I know it's a boring intro sentence, but yet I'm not allowed to stop and think of how to write more eloquently. I guess that leads me to my next thought  school. This is my first semester at college and there is so much going on. When you asked to write down our stress factor on a scale of 17, I believe I might have marked an 8. There are so many things that are going on, and I want to be able to organize everything in time slots. The only thing is that they keep giving me stuff to do. I suppose you would define ""they"" as professors with homework and S. I meetings, which I really want to attend. Then I had my first sorority meeting last night, and they have so much in store for us this semester. I suppose I should tell you that I love going home  not to see my family (will, sort of that too  you got to love mom and dad!), but I have boyfriend back at Houston. I was planning on going home all these weekends, but it turns out that I have something I have to do that is mandatory on almost every weekend. This boyfriend of mine is totally worth the trouble and stress of going home. I have had the most amazing summer with him just hanging out and doing fun activities. He makes me feel ten times happier when I'm around him and it's just really hard not having him here to help me adjust into this new life style. I do however, talk to him everyday and write him letters. The first week I arrived in Austin, I can honestly say that it sucked because rush drained a lot out of me and then we had to start school with no breaks from rush week. I thought I would be able to adjust better in this big place, because I consider myself an easy going friendly person. There is just so much that is consuming my life right now that I hardly have time to stop and think about what I need to do. I love exercising and used to do it everyday, and now I haven't had time to do any of that this past week because of school. I just hate this time in my life right now when everything is so jumbled up in my brain. I can't wait for the day when I have everything organized and I don't feel too constrained to one aspect of my life. I also hate this time because you don't really know anybody. True, I've met people and they are all really nice, but I haven't gotten to that stage when you can say anything to them and not look stupid. I am really glad that I did join the sorority just so I can meet people, but there are 60 people that I can meet and that's just too much for me to build strong friendships all at once. I do have some friends from back home, but I hardly have time to visit with them because I'm so consumed with everything else. I just need to sit down and relax. I did go home for Labor Day to visit my boyfriend, and that was exactly what I needed  just to hang out with someone who knows you so well. We did basically nothing and it was great not having to worry about anything. That weekend I think was somewhat a turning point in my attitude of college. It just made me realize that it is harder than I thought (adjusting wise) but everything turns out okay in the end. Plus I was happy to know that I do have somebody who loves me just as much as I love him; and that when I'm missing him, he's thinking about me too. I guess it just made me feel not so lost in college knowing that I have a great person back home supporting me every step of the way. Okay, twenty minutes are up.",0
"stream of consciousness. we studied about that in junior english. what am I thinking. mowed the lawn. hot sun. sweating. boyfriend says I don't have enough time for him. parents say I spend too much time with him and goofing off . i haven't had time to do anything but work and go to school. i have to work today at 2:30 till close. this is fun I like this assignment. parents are eating lunch. they are always on my back about something or another it seems. they make me so mad . I can't wait to get out of here and get my own place and have my own rules, clean house when I want to and not when they tell me to. i love them but I need freedom. why won't they move my curfew up, why do I even have a curfew. I am 18 years old and I should be able to stay out later than 12:30. i love billy so much. it tears me up that we fight so much. walking on campus. gees yesterday was a bad day. every thing went wrong. i have to host three parties today at work. i wonder what packages they are. billy has my license. I need to get it back today. i wonder where they came up with that name. I wish I could be a famous singer. then I wouldn't have to work so hard at getting money and a decent job. I hate rita. what gives her the right to say that we have sucky cashiers. like she is any better herself. she can't keep employees and not many people like her. she is so rude. i wonder if it is true about her husband. that is sad that her stepson thinks she is his real mom. I can't believe they haven't told him yet . he is what almost about 11 or so. 3mins left. i wonder what our next poject in here is. it says on the syllabus. when I am done I will look. i hope it is fun and not borring and hard to understand like my mythology teacher and english assignments. time is almost up then I will call billy back and take a shower and go to work.",0
"They are a gift I have wanted again.
Wanted: One moment in mountains
when winter got so cold
the oil froze before it could burn.
I chopped ferns of hoarfrost from all the windows
and peered up at pines, a wedding cake
by a baker gone mad. Swirls by the thousand
shimmered above me until a cloud
lumbered over a ridge,
bringing the heavier white of more flurries.
I believed, I believed, I believed
it would last, that when you went out
to test the black ice or to dig out a Volkswagon
filled with rich women, you’d return
and we’d sputter like oil,
match after match, warm in the making.
Wisconsin’s flat farmland never approved:
I hid in cornfields far into October,
listening to music that whirled from my thumbprint.
When sunset played havoc with bright leaves of alders,
I never mentioned longing or fear.
I crouched like a good refugee in brown creeks
and forgot why Autumn is harder than Spring.
But snug on the western slope of that mountain
I’d accept every terror, break open seals
to release love’s headwaters to unhurried sunlight.
Weren’t we Big Hearts? Through some trick of silver
we held one another, believing each motion the real one,
ah, lover, why were dark sources bundled up
in our eyes? Each owned an agate,
marbled with anguish, a heart or its echo,
we hardly knew. Lips touching lips,
did that break my horizon
as much as those horses broke my belief?
You drove off and I walked the old road,
scolding the doubles that wanted so much.
The chestnut mare whinnied a cloud into scrub pine.
In a windless corner of a corral,
four horses fit like puzzle pieces.
Their dark eyes and lashes defined by the white.
The colt kicked his hind, loped from the fence.
The mares and a stallion galloped behind,
lifting and leaping, finding each other
in full accord with the earth and their bodies.
No harm ever touched them once they cut loose,
snorting at flurries falling again.
How little our chances for feeling ourselves.
They vanished so quickly—one flick of a tail.
Where do their mountains and moments begin?
I stood a long time in sharpening wind.",0
"This assignment is cool. It requires no outside tinking. I can just think about what I want to think about. Man I've got a three hour drive ahead of me today and i made the same drive yesterday. It was soooo boring. I wish i could just warp back to Austin or something like that. But i like being back in Pearland. It's great to see my family and friends again. I miss them sometimes and the once or twice a month i get to see them are well worth it. But when my trip is over, I'm always eager to see my peeps in Austin again and just to get back to normal life. I've got a lot of reading to do this weekend and i don't want to do it. It's alll textbook reading and i would much rather be reading Dean Koontz or just not be reading at all. I wish i could type faster and that way i could type a lot. I've got to type as much as possible. Otherwise i won't be satisfied with my experiment. blankness. . i want some new CD's to listen to on the way back to Austin. that way i wouldn't get a sbored as i was yesterday. and then the ride would weem much shorter. wow i still got thirteen minutes left. i wish i could slept in longer today but i had to wake up to make sure that i would finish this in time. i don't mind doing it but i'm jsut so dang lazy that this is even annnoying to me. I'm just not good at doing things that i don't want to do. oh well. i talked to Nick last night and we talked about how things are diff. now because i moved to Austin. all he does now is go out with girls since andy is going to San Antonio and i'm already in Austin. things have changed since i moved. i can't just go over to his house anytime i'm bored anymore  it's a three hour drive if i do. i miss those guys and my family more than i thought i would  it's weird being back at home. the place seems different. my room seems foreign to me because my parents cleaned it up and moved things around the week after i left for austin. i hope i'm not getting carpal tunnel syndrome, my wrists are getting kind of sore and my arms are already sore from playing racuetball the other day. it was fun thought and i'm probly going to play again today or tomorrow. i'm looking forward to it. ahhh no more wrist pain. i hope my brother won't get mad at me for stealing his computer chair but it makes my wrists feel so much better. WOW my phones loud it just scared the crap out of me when it rang see there it is!  typing is sooo much easier whne your in a  computer chair and not a dining room chair. i wonder what you'll think when your reading this or if anyone's even going to read it. hmmmmmmm.  i need to leave pretty soon so i don't hit Houston's rush hour but there is so much stuff i need to get done with here. wow the opportunity cost sucks. three more minutes. i only got a few more minutes and then no more of this mind to page thing. after that i can just think and not have to type it up or anything ike that. i hope Pearland wins tonight and moves up in Houston's rankings and AP state rankings. they are relaly good and deserve to be high up in all rankings. likewise i hope UT kicks NC's butt tomorrow because UT IS all that and a huge bag of potato chips. then maybe they could move ahead of OU in the AP rankings because everyone knows we're better than those north of the red river weirdos  who cares about the sooners anyway. Hybl sucks and their second and third strigers are both freshmen and that's really going to hurt em bad. oh well we'll see on October 12th. GO HORNS!!!",0
" If someone were to win the lottery, they would likely have a significant amount of money at their disposal. The first thing they should do is to consult a financial advisor to help them manage their newfound wealth. They would need to create a budget, invest wisely, and plan for the future.  After that, they might want to consider paying off any outstanding debts, such as a mortgage or student loans. They could also help their loved ones by paying off their debts or giving them monetary gifts.  They might also choose to donate some of their winnings to charitable organizations. This would allow them to make a positive impact on the world while also receiving tax benefits.  Finally, they could use some of their winnings to treat themselves and their loved ones to some well-deserved luxuries, such as a dream vacation or a new home. It's important to remember to enjoy the fruits of their labor, but to also be responsible and thoughtful with their newfound wealth. ",1
" The statement made by Samuel Johnson, ""Ignorance, when voluntary, is criminal,"" implies that people who choose to remain ignorant of important information or knowledge can be held accountable for their actions. In some cases, this may be true, as deliberate ignorance can lead to harmful or unethical decisions.  For example, a doctor who intentionally ignores new medical research and continues to use outdated practices that harm their patients could be considered criminally negligent. Similarly, a politician who refuses to educate themselves on important policy issues and makes uninformed decisions that negatively impact their constituents could be held accountable for their ignorance.  However, it's important to note that not all cases of ignorance can be considered criminal. Some people may not have access to certain information or may not have the resources to educate themselves. In such cases, it would be unfair to hold them responsible for their ignorance.  Moreover, ignorance is not always a voluntary choice. Many people are born into situations where they are deprived of education or exposed only to biased or incomplete information. In such cases, it would be unjust to consider their ignorance criminal.  In conclusion, while Samuel Johnson's statement may hold true in some cases, it's important to consider the context and circumstances surrounding the ignorance in question. Ultimately, it is important for individuals to make a conscious effort to educate themselves and remain informed, as ignorance can have far-reaching consequences.    ",1
"  Watching TV is a common pastime for many people, especially in the evenings. It can be entertaining, informative, and relaxing. However, watching too much TV can also have negative effects on our health, well-being, and cognitive abilities. In this essay, I will argue that we should spend less time in front of the TV and more time engaging in other activities that are beneficial for our mind and body.  One of the main reasons why watching too much TV is bad for us is that it can increase our risk of developing various chronic diseases. According to a study by Johns Hopkins University1, excessive TV viewing can lead to reduced amounts of gray matter in the brain, which is responsible for mental processing. This can impair our memory, attention, and decision-making skills. Moreover, watching too much TV can also raise our blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugar levels, which can contribute to cardiovascular diseases and diabetes2. A study by Harvard Health3 found that people who watched more than four hours of TV a day had a 49% higher risk of heart attack, stroke, and death than those who watched less than two hours.  Another reason why watching too much TV is harmful is that it can disrupt our sleep patterns and quality. Sleep is essential for our physical and mental health, as it helps us repair our tissues, regulate our hormones, and consolidate our memories. However, watching TV before bed can interfere with our natural circadian rhythms and melatonin production, which are responsible for regulating our sleep-wake cycle2. The bright light and stimulating content of TV can also keep us awake and alert, making it harder to fall asleep and stay asleep. Lack of sleep can lead to fatigue, mood swings, impaired concentration, and lower immunity.  A third reason why watching too much TV is detrimental is that it can reduce our social interaction and engagement with the world. TV can be a source of entertainment and information, but it can also isolate us from our family, friends, and community. Watching TV can take away time and opportunities for meaningful conversations, shared activities, and emotional support. It can also limit our exposure to diverse perspectives, cultures, and experiences. Furthermore, watching too much TV can make us passive consumers of information and entertainment, rather than active participants in learning and creating. TV can also influence our attitudes, values, and behaviors in negative ways, such as promoting violence, stereotypes, consumerism, and unrealistic expectations.  Therefore, I believe that we should spend less time in front of the TV and more time doing other things that are good for our health and happiness. Some examples of alternative activities are:  Reading books or magazines that stimulate our imagination and curiosity. Playing games or puzzles that challenge our brain and improve our cognitive skills. Exercising or doing sports that strengthen our muscles and cardiovascular system. Meditating or doing yoga that relax our mind and body. Cooking or gardening that enhance our creativity and sensory awareness. Volunteering or joining clubs that expand our social network and contribute to society. By reducing our TV time and increasing our involvement in these activities, we can improve our physical and mental well-being, as well as enrich our lives with more joy and meaning.      ",1
" The issue of labeling albums with explicit content warnings has been a controversial topic for decades. While some argue that labeling is enough to warn parents about inappropriate lyrics, others believe that more needs to be done.  One potential solution would be for the record industry to implement a rating system similar to the movie industry. This would involve assigning ratings to albums based on the content, such as ""PG-13"" or ""R"" ratings. This would allow parents to make more informed decisions about what their children are exposed to.  Another potential solution would be for the record industry to provide more detailed information about the content of each album on their websites or in stores. This could include providing a list of all songs with explicit content and a brief explanation of why they are labeled as such.  Ultimately, the best solution may be a combination of these approaches. By providing more information and implementing a rating system, parents would have more tools to make informed decisions about the media their children consume.  ",1
"  As an AI language model, I don't have a physical presence to travel, but I do have access to vast amounts of information about various places around the world. One place that I believe is very meaningful and rewarding to visit is the ancient city of Petra, located in Jordan.  Petra is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and is considered one of the New Seven Wonders of the World. It is a city carved out of rock, dating back to the 3rd century BC, and was the capital of the Nabataean Kingdom. The city was lost to the world for centuries and was only rediscovered in the early 19th century.  The main attraction in Petra is the Treasury, a stunning temple carved into the rock face, which is believed to have been used as a tomb for a Nabataean king. The Treasury is one of the most iconic images of Petra and has been featured in many movies and TV shows. Visitors can also explore the many other temples, tombs, and monuments in the city, including the Monastery, which is reached by climbing a series of steep steps.  Aside from the incredible architecture, Petra also has a rich history and culture. The Nabataeans were skilled traders and controlled the spice and incense trade routes between Arabia and the Mediterranean. The city's location at the crossroads of these trade routes made it a hub of cultural exchange, and visitors can still see evidence of the diverse cultures that passed through the city.  Moreover, Petra is located in a beautiful and rugged landscape. The city is surrounded by mountains and canyons, which offer a range of hiking opportunities, from easy walks to challenging treks. Visitors can also explore the Wadi Rum desert, which is located nearby and is famous for its stunning sandstone formations and Lawrence of Arabia connections.  Visiting Petra is a once-in-a-lifetime experience that should not be missed. It offers a unique combination of history, culture, architecture, and natural beauty that is unparalleled. Whether you are a history buff, an architecture enthusiast, or an adventurer, Petra has something to offer everyone. So, if you are planning a trip to Jordan, make sure you include Petra in your itinerary. It will be a trip you will never forget.       ",1
" The movie and TV ratings systems were created to provide information to audiences about the content of films and TV shows, in order to help them make informed decisions about what they want to watch. The goal of these systems is to ensure that viewers are not exposed to material that they might find inappropriate or offensive.  The effectiveness and usefulness of these ratings systems depend on various factors, such as the accuracy of the ratings, the consistency of their application, and the level of awareness and understanding of the audience.  For example, in the United States, the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) assigns ratings to movies based on their content, such as G (General Audiences), PG (Parental Guidance Suggested), PG-13 (Parents Strongly Cautioned), R (Restricted), and NC-17 (No One 17 and Under Admitted). Similarly, TV Parental Guidelines assign ratings to TV shows based on their content, such as TV-Y (All Children), TV-Y7 (Older Children), TV-G (General Audience), TV-PG (Parental Guidance Suggested), TV-14 (Parents Strongly Cautioned), and TV-MA (Mature Audience Only).  While these ratings systems provide a general idea of the content of movies and TV shows, they are not always accurate or consistent. Some films or TV shows might receive a lower rating than they deserve, while others might be given a higher rating than necessary. Additionally, the rating system might not capture certain types of content that could be potentially harmful or offensive.  Moreover, the effectiveness of these ratings systems also depends on the level of awareness and understanding of the audience. While some viewers may rely on ratings to decide what to watch, others may not pay much attention to them, or may not fully understand what the different ratings mean.  In conclusion, while movie and TV ratings systems can be useful in providing information about the content of films and TV shows, their effectiveness depends on various factors. Ultimately, it is up to the individual viewer to decide what they want to watch and to be aware of the potential risks and benefits of different types of content.           ",1
"The heart's unsung melody 
Echoes through the night 
In the symphony of the soul's longing 
For love's sweet delight 

A stirring in the deepest parts 
Rises up like a tide 
The yearning for a love so pure 
It can't be denied 

The strings that pull our heart along 
Are harp strings in our chest 
Each note a plea for happiness 
That won't let us rest 

We search for love in countless ways 
But it always seems to flee 
As the symphony of the soul's longing 
Becomes our destiny 

We learn to live with broken hearts 
And hope that one sweet day 
We'll find the love we've been seeking 
In the symphony we play.",1
"Ugliness, oh how unkind,
A mark upon the face and mind.
A label we give to those we see,
A weight to bear, an identity.

But who decides what is beauty?
A societal norm, a fleeting duty.
Is it not in the eye of the beholder?
A subjective view, a personal folder.

For what is deemed grotesque to one,
May be a masterpiece to some.
An imperfect flower, a broken vase,
Can still hold beauty in its embrace.

So let us not be quick to judge,
Or turn away with a cold, hard nudge.
For ugliness may just be a facade,
And beneath it lies a beauty, flawed.

Let us see with eyes anew,
And find the beauty, pure and true.
For in the world there is much to behold,
Even in the ugliness, a story untold.",1
"I can remember when I wanted X
more than anything ever—for X fill in
from your own childhood
[balloon, pencil lead, trading card, shoelaces, a bow
or not to have to wear a bow]
and now I am moved to action, when I am moved,
principally by a memory of what to want.
The point is to be, in your own eyes, what you are,
or to keep your own tools, so that you can pretend.

to me at least, when Cooper, who is two,
collapsed in fortissimo fits when he could not have
a $20, three-foot-long stuffed frog
in the image of Frog from Frog and Toad, since he is Toad.
That morning, needing a nap,
he had thrown, from the third-story balcony
of Miller's Cafe and Bakery, into the whistling
rapids and shallows
of the Ammonoosuc River, with its arrowheads and caravans of stones,
his Red Sox cap. His hair was shining like
another planet's second sun,
as he explained, looking up, ""I threw my hat in the river.

"Constant-voltage speaker systems refer to networks of loudspeakers which are connected to an audio amplifier using step-up and step-down transformers to simplify impedance calculations and to minimize power loss over the speaker cables. They are more appropriately called high-voltage audio distribution systems. The voltage is constant only in the sense that at full power, the voltage in the system does not depend on the number of speakers driven (as long the amplifier's maximum power is not exceeded). Constant-voltage speaker systems are also commonly referred to as 25-, 70-, 70.7-, or 100-volt speaker systems; distributed speaker systems; or high-impedance speaker systems.  In Canada and the US, they are most commonly referred to as 70-volt speakers. In Europe, the 100 V system is the most widespread, with amplifier and speaker products being simply labeled with 100 V. Operation Constant-voltage speaker systems are analogous to electrical power transmission methods employed by electric utility companies to transmit electric power over long distances. Typically, an electric utility will step up the voltage of the power transmitted, which correspondingly reduces the current, hence reducing the power loss during transmission. The voltage is stepped down at the destination. Similarly, in a constant-voltage speaker system, the amplifier uses a transformer to step up the voltage of the audio signal to reduce power loss over the speaker cable, allowing more power to be transmitted over a given wire diameter. Each speaker in the system has a step-down transformer to reduce the voltage to a usable level.",0

"The A5120 is an A-class road in Bedfordshire, linking the conjoined towns of Ampthill and Flitwick to Dunstable and, via the M1 motorway, Luton and London. It connects with the M1 at junction 12 in close proximity to the Toddington services. On its route from Ampthill to Dunstable, the A5120 serves Westoning, Harlington, Toddington and Tebworth. Unusually for an A-road, it does not meet another A-road at any point between its start on the A507 and its end on the A5. This would change if the A505 Dunstable North Bypass were to be built, however. When the A5120 meets the A5 in Dunstable, the latter is multiplexed with the A505 road. The road passes through the Houghton Regis area of Dunstable as it approaches the town from the north. The road actually continues past the A5, without its A5120 number, as an unclassified road, into the Beecroft industrial estate, where it meets the B489 road from Ivinghoe.",0
" Conveniences are things that make our lives easier, more comfortable, or more enjoyable. They can be products, services, technologies, or practices that save us time, effort, money, or hassle. Conveniences have changed people's lives in many ways, both positive and negative. In this essay, I will discuss some of the impacts of conveniences on different aspects of human life, such as media, health, education, and social relationships.  One of the most obvious ways that conveniences have changed people's lives is through media and media consumption. Thanks to the internet, smartphones, streaming platforms, and social media, we have access to a vast amount of information and entertainment at our fingertips. We can watch movies and shows on demand, listen to music and podcasts, read books and articles, play games, and communicate with anyone around the world. According to the World Economic Forum[^1^][1], technology has radically transformed our societies and our daily lives since the dotcom bubble burst in 2000. Technology has also enabled new forms of media production and distribution, such as blogs, podcasts, YouTube videos, and online platforms for journalism and activism. These conveniences have given us more choices, opportunities, and empowerment as media consumers and producers.  However, conveniences also have some drawbacks when it comes to media and media consumption. For example, some people may become addicted to their devices and spend too much time online, neglecting their physical and mental health, their work or studies, and their social interactions. Some people may also become overwhelmed by the amount of information and entertainment available online and suffer from information overload or decision fatigue. Moreover, some people may be exposed to misinformation, propaganda, hate speech, cyberbullying, or other harmful content online that can affect their beliefs, attitudes, emotions, or behaviors. Additionally, some people may lose their critical thinking skills or their sense of reality when they rely too much on online sources or platforms for their information and opinions.  Another way that conveniences have changed people's lives is through health and healthcare. Thanks to advances in medicine, biotechnology, engineering, and artificial intelligence, we have access to better diagnosis, treatment, prevention, and cure of various diseases and conditions. We can also monitor our health using wearable devices or apps that track our vital signs, activity levels, sleep patterns, or nutrition. We can also order medicines or consult doctors online using telemedicine services. According to KARK[^2^][2], a life of convenience has allowed many people to enjoy longer and healthier lives.  However, conveniences also have some negative impacts on health and healthcare. For instance, some people may become lazy or sedentary when they rely too much on technology or services for their daily tasks or needs. Some people may also develop unhealthy habits or lifestyles when they consume too much fast food, processed food, alcohol, or drugs that are easily available or delivered to their doorsteps. Some people may also lose their natural immunity or resistance to diseases when they overuse antibiotics, vaccines, or supplements that are meant to protect them from infections or illnesses. Furthermore, some people may face ethical, legal, or social dilemmas when they use technologies or services that alter their genes, organs, or appearance for cosmetic, enhancement, or reproductive purposes.  A third way that conveniences have changed people's lives is through education and learning. Thanks to the internet, computers, tablets, and online platforms, we have access to a wide range of educational resources and opportunities at any time and place. We can learn new skills, languages, or subjects using online courses, tutorials, or videos. We can also obtain degrees or certificates from reputable institutions using online programs or platforms. According to Shauna Hart[^2^][2], a mother of three adult children who completed a degree online, technology has opened a lot more doors for education and learning that would not have been possible otherwise.  However, conveniences also have some challenges when it comes to education and learning. For example, some people may lack the motivation, discipline, or self-regulation skills to complete their online courses or programs successfully. Some people may also cheat or plagiarize when they use online sources or tools for their assignments or exams. Moreover, some people may miss out on the social, emotional, or cultural aspects of education and learning when they study online without interacting with their teachers or peers face-to-face. Additionally, some people may face difficulties in finding jobs or recognition when they use online degrees or certificates that are not accredited or accepted by employers or institutions. ",1
"Sleep is a 2013 film directed by Juha Lilja consisting of approximately 1 hour long takes about Lilja himself sleeping naked. Multiple camera angles are used, and film also contains dream sequences, which are shot on a drone and a motorcycle. The Film premiered at International Film Festival Rotterdam in 2015 as a part of its Signals 24/7 theme, which was focusing on how the attention economy and technological improvements have changed society. Other films from the director have been screened in festivals in Asia and USA. The film was released 50 years after the release of Sleep from American artist and filmmaker Andy Warhol. The 2013 remake explores how modern technology has made it easier for anyone to produce such monumental length films. Warhol had originally planned Sleep to be an 8-hour film. According to his memoirs, he had said to Gerard Malanga: ""Wouldn't it be fabulous to film Brigitte Bardot sleeping for eight hours"" Because of technical difficulties it was not possible at the time. Lilja's version was made to reach the 8 hour goal.",0
"The Denver Guardian was a fake news website, known for a popular untrue story about Hillary Clinton posted on the site on November 5, 2016, three days before the 2016 U.S. presidential election, which Clinton lost. The story, entitled ""FBI Agent Suspected In Hillary Email Leaks Found Dead In Apparent Murder-Suicide"", alleged that an FBI agent investigating Clinton had been found dead in a Maryland house fire.  The story was shared on Facebook (a news source for ""44 percent of U.S. adults"") more than half a million times and earned more than 15.5 million impressions. According to a Denver Post newspaper story on the Denver Guardian and the Clinton article, While ""The Guardian"" claimed to be Denver's ""oldest"" news source, the site's domain was first registered only a few months before in July 2016; the story on Clinton appeared to be the only article on the website (it was ""the only story showing up under the ""News"" section and all other sections are turning up errors"");  while the story quoted a ""Walkerville Police Chief Pat Frederick"", Walkersville, Maryland, does not have a police department; but have Five Resident State Police officers  And the address the site listed for ""The Guardian"" newsroom was actually a parking lot. The site was registered anonymously and built using WordPress, but an investigator employed by National Public Radio found the site was operated by Jestin Coler, the founder, and CEO of Disinfomedia and owner of several other faux news sites.

"A web portal is a specially designed website that brings information from diverse sources, like emails, online forums and search engines, together in a uniform way. Usually, each information source gets its dedicated area on the page for displaying information (a portlet); often, the user can configure which ones to display. Variants of portals include mashups and intranet ""dashboards"" for executives and managers. The extent to which content is displayed in a ""uniform way"" may depend on the intended user and the intended purpose, as well as the diversity of the content. Very often design emphasis is on a certain ""metaphor"" for configuring and customizing the presentation of the content (e.g., a dashboard or map) and the chosen implementation framework or code libraries. In addition, the role of the user in an organization may determine which content can be added to the portal or deleted from the portal configuration. A portal may use a search engine's application programming interface (API) to permit users to search intranet content as opposed to extranet content by restricting which domains may be searched. Apart from this common search engines feature, web portals may offer other services such as e-mail, news, stock quotes, information from databases and even entertainment content. Portals provide a way for enterprises and organizations to provide a consistent ""look and feel"" with access control and procedures for multiple applications and databases, which otherwise would have been different web entities at various URLs. The features available may be restricted by whether access is by an authorized and authenticated user (employee, member) or an anonymous website visitor.",0
"Hatanpää  is a district in Tampere, Finland, located in the southern part of the city center on the shores of Lake Pyhäjärvi. Hatanpää is actually a peninsula that protrudes towards the lake, leaving the waters of Viinikanlahti Bay to the north and Vihilahti Bay to the south. The area is named after Hatanpää Manor, whose land from Härmälä to Sääksjärvi and Nekala was bought for the city in 1913. Administratively, the area has belonged to the city since 1920. In 2014, the population of the area was measured as 2,686 inhabitants. Hatanpää is a well-known district because of its many significant sites, including Hatanpää Manor, Hatanpää Park and Hatanpää Arboretum, primary school and high school, and TAYS' second large hospital area, Hatanpää Hospital, as well as a large number of car dealerships and industry. The busy Hatanpää Highway (Hatanpään valtatie), which branches off from Hämeenkatu, leads directly to the area, sideways to the bus station and Viinikanlahti, and strongly divides it in two. On the east side of the road there are industry and car shops, on the west side and closer to the center there are large office buildings and further south the residential area bordering Hatanpää Park. Several IT companies are located in former houses of Nokia in Hatanpää and in former Sarvis properties. In the vicinity of the office buildings is the Viinikka's wastewater treatment plant, which causes local odor nuisances. However, odor nuisances do not affect residential and park areas.",0

"City life is a rush,
A never-ending storm.
Lights flash and buildings loom,
A skyline to adorn.

The streets are paved with people,
Rushing to and fro.
Cars honk and sirens blare,
As they come and go.

Tall buildings stand like giants,
Reaching for the sky above.
Separated by narrow canyons,
With bustling streets below.

The city never sleeps,
Always moving, always alive.
With people from all walks of life,
And stories to revive.

The sounds of the city are a symphony,
A blend of noise and song.
The rhythm of urban life,
That keeps us moving along.

The city skyline is majestic,
A sight to behold.
But it's the people that make it,
The city's heart and soul.

Despite the chaos and the rush,
The city has a charm.
A place where dreams are made,
And futures are formed.",1
"At a desk made of glass,
In a glass walled-room
With red airport carpet,
An officer asked
My father for fingerprints,
And my father refused,
So another offered him tea
And he sipped it. The teacup
Template for fingerprints.
My father says, it was just
Hot water with a bag.
My father says, in his country,
Because the earth knows
The scent of history,
It gave the people sage.
I like my tea with sage
From my mother’﻿s garden,
Next to the snapdragons
She calls fishmouths
Coming out for air. A remedy
For stomach pains she keeps
In the kitchen where
She always sings.
First, she is Hagar
Boiling water
Where tea is loosened.
Then she drops
In it a pinch of sage
And lets it sit a while.
She tells a story:
The groom arrives late
To his wedding
Wearing only one shoe.
The bride asks him
About the shoe. He tells her
He lost it while jumping
Over a house-wall.
Breaking away from soldiers.
She asks:
Tea with sage
Or tea with mint?
With sage, he says,
Sweet scent, bitter tongue.

"Hate is a flame that burns so bright,
A poison that eats at the soul like a blight.
It twists and turns in a wicked dance,
And leaves destruction in its every chance.

It grows and festers deep within,
An endless pit of anger and sin.
It thrives on pain and suffering,
And leaves behind a world so utterly suffocating.

It blinds us to the beauty that surrounds,
A darkness that envelopes and astounds.
It feeds on envy, greed, and jealousy,
And leaves behind a trail of misery.

Hate is a weapon we wield with ease,
A tool of destruction that no one can appease.
It drives us to do unspeakable things,
And leaves behind a trail of ruin and bling.

So let us reject this terrible fate,
And strive instead for love and not hate.
Let us celebrate difference and diversity,
And live in harmony with peace and prosperity.",1

Through rustling leaves and murmuring streams.

Of the magic that the night-time brings.

It whispers secrets to the stars above,
Of all the wonders hidden from sight,
And tells of a story of never-ending love,
That shines eternal in the moon's soft light.

As I listen to this magical song,
My heart is filled with a sense of peace,
And I know that I belong,
To this world of dreams and beauty that will never cease.

So let the wind carry me away,
To the world of dreams and pure delight,
And let me dance beneath the moon's soft sway,
Beneath the starry sky's shimmering light.",1
"John Brugman, O.F.M., was a 15th-century Franciscan friar, who became a renowned preacher in the Netherlands Biography Brugman was born at Kempen in the Electorate of Cologne, towards the end of the preceding century; died at Nijmegen, Netherlands, 19 September 1473.   Brugman became a lector of theology, Vicar Provincial and one of the founders of the Cologne Province of the Observants, a reformed branch of the  Friars Minor. For twenty years his name was celebrated as the most illustrious preacher of the Low Countries. The saying still exists in that region, ""to speak like Brugman"", meaning to speak eloquently. A friend of Denis the Carthusian, it was at his suggestion that the latter wrote his work: De doctrinâ et regulis vitae Christianæ, dedicating it to Brugman.   Brugman also supported the foundation of the Brothers of the Common Life, a congregation, devoted to the interests of education, established by two priests, Gerhard Groote and Florentius Radewiyns. He addressed them in the two letters which are still extant to strengthen them in the persecution to which they were subjected.   Brugman died in the odour of sanctity and is commemorated in the Martyrologium Minoritico-Belgicum on 19 September.",0
"A secretory protein is any protein, whether it be endocrine or exocrine, which is secreted by a cell. Secretory proteins include many hormones, enzymes, toxins, and antimicrobial peptides. Secretory proteins are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum. Production The production of a secretory protein starts like any other protein. The mRNA is produced and transported to the cytosol where it interacts with a free cytosolic ribosome. The part that is produced first, the N-terminal, contains a signal sequence consisting of 6 to 12 amino acids with hydrophobic side chains. This sequence is recognised by a cytosolic protein, SRP (Signal Recognition Particle), which stops the translation and aids in the transport of the mRNA-ribosome complex to an SRP receptor found in the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum. When it arrives at the ER, the signal sequence is transferred to the translocon, a protein-conducting channel in the membrane that allows the newly synthesized polypeptide to be translocated to the ER lumen. The dissociation of SRP from the ribosome restores the translation of the secretory protein. The signal sequence is removed and the translation continues while the produced chain moves through the translocon (cotranslational translocation).",0
"Well,after I finally figured out how to get into all of this computer stuff,I'm going to calm down by writing. The first thing comes to my mind is I'm wondering whether I should go out tonight or not. I'm determined to finish all of my homework for this week and I'm sure that I'll finish everything by ten or ten thirty. But' my body really doesn't need for me to go out, but by ten or eleven o'clock I get really antsy. I'm proud of myself today because I took care of a lot of stuff that needed to do. I woke up at eleven, which is later than I wanted but I got moving right away. I went to TOP and bought all of my pictures and then I went to my Art History class. After class, Iwent with my two friends Sara and Whitney to University Realtors to figure out our living situation at Villas next year. It turned out that the apartment we wanted had already been taken after the guy said he would reserve it for us. So we got really mad at him and we worked it oit that we would move into the six bedroom apartment rather than the five bedroom apartment. Therefore, we had to get two more roommates. So we went over to Joanie's place and got Erin Vaughn and Joanie to live with us. It actually turned out for the better because the six bedroom place is for 8 people but since he screwed us over, we get to have nine people. With nine people, the rent ends up being cheaper. Since I'm sharing a room with my friend Jennifer, it'll be cheaper for us. I'm really excited about the girls I'll be living with next year because they are all really cool. My roommates for next year at Villas will be Anne, Carolyn, Jennifer, Paige, Sara, Whitney, Joanie, and Erin. I also had Ed on my mind today. He's my new boyfriend and I'm just crazy about him. Everybody says how great it is for me because he is such a nice guy and a gentlman. We just met about two and a half weeks ago and we were crazy about each other right away. Everyone is so surprised that I didn't know him before because we are so close already. Everyone asks how we met: he is my good guy friend's roommate. My guy friend is Will and right when Will moved into Towers, he wanted me to come over and see his place. So I went over there and I distinctly remembering Ed answer the door and I had met him for the first time. I thought he was so cute and we just talked for alittle while and our personalities seemed to click. Later that night, Ed called and invited me to the football game. Then we just started talking more and more and we just fell for each other. I've already screwed up a little bit in our relationship and I was terified that he would leave me. But, he forgave me and took me back right away and I'm so incredibly thankful. I never want to feel that bad again in my life. That's when I knew that I really was head over heels for him when I was terribly depressed over such a small mistake. I hope it works out for the future and all of my friends just tell me to grasp on to the now with your boyfriend and not to look ahead or else it could end up causing problems. I'm just so anxious about everything because this is my first real boyfriend ever. Well, my twenty minutes is up. Bye.",0

"Vaclav Smil (; born 9 December 1943) is a Czech-Canadian scientist and policy analyst. He is Distinguished Professor Emeritus in the Faculty of Environment at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.  His interdisciplinary research interests encompass a broad area of energy, environmental, food, population, economic, historical and public policy studies. He has also applied these approaches to energy, food and environmental affairs of China. Early life and education Smil was born during WWII in Plzeň, at that time in the German Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia (present-day Czech Republic). His father was a police officer and his mother a book keeper. Growing up in a remote mountain town in the Plzeň Region, Smil cut wood daily to keep the home heated. This provided an early lesson in energy efficiency and density.   Smil completed his undergraduate studies at the Faculty of Natural Sciences of Charles University in Prague, where he took 35 classes a week, 10 months a year, for 5 years. ""They taught me nature, from geology to clouds,"" Smil said. After graduation he refused to join the Communist party, undermining his job prospects, though he found employment at a regional planning office. He married Eva, who was studying to be a physician. In 1969, following the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia and also Eva's graduation, the Smils emigrated to the US, leaving the country months before a Soviet travel ban shut the borders. ""That was not a minor sacrifice, you know?"" Smil says. Over the next two years, Smil completed a doctorate in Geography at the College of Earth and Mineral Sciences of the Pennsylvania State University.",0
"At length, by so much importunity press'd,
Take, C——, at once, the inside of my breast;
This stupid indiff'rence so often you blame,
Is not owing to nature, to fear, or to shame:
I am not as cold as a virgin in lead,
Nor is Sunday's sermon so strong in my head:
I know but too well how time flies along,
That we live but few years, and yet fewer are young.
But I hate to be cheated, and never will buy
Long years of repentance for moments of joy,
Oh! was there a man (but where shall I find
Good sense and good nature so equally join'd?)
Would value his pleasure, contribute to mine;
Not meanly would boast, nor would lewdly design;
Not over severe, yet not stupidly vain,
For I would have the power, tho' not give the pain.
No pedant, yet learned; no rake-helly gay,
Or laughing, because he has nothing to say;
To all my whole sex obliging and free,
Yet never be fond of any but me;
In public preserve the decorum that's just,
And shew in his eyes he is true to his trust;
Then rarely approach, and respectfully bow,
But not fulsomely pert, nor yet foppishly low.
But when the long hours of public are past,
And we meet with champagne and a chicken at last,
May ev'ry fond pleasure that moment endear;
Be banish'd afar both discretion and fear!
Forgetting or scorning the airs of the crowd,
He may cease to be formal, and I to be proud.
Till lost in the joy, we confess that we live,
And he may be rude, and yet I may forgive.
And that my delight may be solidly fix'd,
Let the friend and the lover be handsomely mix'd;
In whose tender bosom my soul may confide,
Whose kindness can soothe me, whose counsel can guide.
From such a dear lover as here I describe,
No danger should fright me, no millions should bribe;
But till this astonishing creature I know,
As I long have liv'd chaste, I will keep myself so.
I never will share with the wanton coquette,
Or be caught by a vain affectation of wit.
The toasters and songsters may try all their art,
But never shall enter the pass of my heart.
I loath the lewd rake, the dress'd fopling despise:
Before such pursuers the nice virgin flies:
And as Ovid has sweetly in parable told,
We harden like trees, and like rivers grow cold.",0
"I am a freshman at UT but it is not a new experience for me. My older brother and sister both went here and my brother is still here to help me out which is awesome for me. I see so many confused freshman everyday even though it's already the 3rd week of school and they should know where they're going but they don't. I'm just really glad that it's not me. I am really independent however so this would be a fun experience, not scary, even if I was all alone. I like to look at things as being an adventure instead of a danger. I do go home every other weekend though because my boyfriend, who happens to be my brother's best friend, goes to the Art Institute of Dallas. Dallas is where I am from although it has changed a lot since I first moved there. I can't wait until this Thursday when I can go home to see Greg, my boyfriend again. I have been in serious relationships before but never have I been so much in love. Ever since we starting dating both of us just knew that we were going to be together for the rest of our lives. I can't wait to get done with school, start my job as an elementary school teacher, and be married to the love of my life. As corny and ""Leave it to Beaver"" as that may sound, that is really what I want to do. My real life goal was always just to be a Mom and nothing else. I didn't want a ""real job"" as they're called even though being a housewife is much harder than many highranking jobs out there. But, my dad said that I was too smart to do that and that if one day I just happened to be on my own I needed a good education so that I could have a good job to support myself or my kids with. It actually never occurred to me that I wouldn't go to college until he said that. I wanted to go to college for 4 years, but I guess I was just thinking that I wouldn't have a major but still graduate somehow. I was young then and didn't quite know how this whole college thing worked yet. But, anyhow, here I am and I'm loving it. It is such a refreshing changed from high school where you feel like you are going to a prison every day where they freeze you to death and make you tired as hell. But there was really no possible way to fall asleep because it was always way too cold to relax. So it really was like torture in that it was as if they were filling you full of some sleeping agent but holding your eyelids open for 8 hours. Enough about that though, bad memories. I am here now not knowing quite what to expect. I took summer classes at a really, really easy junior college this summer and have enough credits to be a sophomore when spring semester starts. The faster I get out, the better. But I know that UT is nothing like a junior college in any way. And I also know that no matter how easy a class seems during lecture, the tests are always hard and are nothing to take lightly. Which is good because if this school was easy, I wouldn't learn anything that I would remember longer than the test. But, it also puts a hamper on some of those freshman who expect it to be like high school. They go out on weeknights and party and don't get home until the next morning and then get up for class 3 hours later. And maybe they could pull that in high school and get away with it, or maybe they never did that in high school and are just experimenting with their new found freedom. Either way, they are going to get a big slap in the face when their first test rolls around. But that is their problem and not mine, although life would be much kinder to them if they would have learned that during high school.",0

Longing for an embrace, so tight and dire.

Forbidden, their love was deemed,
A bond so strong, yet never redeemed.
They met in secret, under the stars,
Yearning for each other's love, with scars.

Their families locked them away,
Lovers torn, with nothing to say.
Their hearts shattered into pieces,
Longing for that sweet, sweet release.

Alas, their love was not meant to be,
Torn apart by society's decree.
Never to hold each other close,
Forever their love shall remain a rose.

A rose with thorns, piercing through their hearts,
Star-crossed lovers, forever apart.",1

" Some argue that a parent should be a child's disciplinarian, while others believe a parent should be a child's best friend. Both approaches have their advantages and disadvantages, and ultimately the decision depends on individual circumstances and personal beliefs.  On one hand, being a child's disciplinarian can help establish boundaries, discipline, and respect for authority. Parents who take on this role may use a strict, authoritarian style of parenting, where rules are enforced and punishments are given for disobedience. This approach can help children learn self-control, responsibility, and respect for others.  For example, a parent may discipline their child for lying or breaking the rules. The child may feel upset or angry at the time, but over time they may learn that their actions have consequences and that they need to be responsible for their behavior. This can help them become more self-disciplined and mature.  On the other hand, being a child's best friend can help build a close, trusting relationship with their parent. Parents who take on this role may use a more relaxed, permissive style of parenting, where rules are flexible and negotiation is encouraged. This approach can help children feel heard, valued, and understood.  For example, a parent may listen to their child's problems, offer advice, and support them through difficult times. The child may feel more comfortable talking to their parent about their feelings and experiences, which can strengthen their bond and lead to greater trust and openness.  Ultimately, the decision of whether to be a child's disciplinarian or best friend depends on a number of factors, including the child's age, personality, and behavior, as well as the parent's own beliefs, values, and parenting style. A balanced approach that combines elements of both discipline and friendship may be the most effective for helping children grow and develop into responsible, independent adults.    ",1
"Ok, I've just turned off the news so the thing that I have on my mind right now is the up and coming election. I really can't stand Gore, he is so robotic, I don't understand how anyone can stomach looking at him or listening to him. Now I am debating whether or not to get up and turn off the television or if I should just sit here and listen to the noise annoy me. Well I have decided to turn it off, ok that's much better, now I can write a more accurate account of what I am thinking. I really don't know what to write, I have never done anything like this before. My computer is really getting on my nerves because it isn't fast enough to keep up with my typing, and I can't stand all the little red squiggly lines that show what all I have misspelled thus far. I don't like not being able to fix it, and now the phone is ringing and that really bothers me because it breaks my concentration even more. Well it turned out to be a wrong number, someone looking for Heidi, I know this because my roommate had to answer on speaker phone, now it is ringing again and it was that girl that had the wrong number, this time she just hung up. What a moron, I mean really how much guts does it really take to fess up and say that you were dumb enough to dial the same wrong number twice? Not saying that I haven't done it before because I most definitely have but I also told the person I was sorry for interrupting them twice. My computer is really getting on my last nerve. I feel like asking my dad to buy me another one. Now that I have said that it reminds me about how everyone always says what a spoiled brat I am for getting everything that I want. I don't think its my fault that my dad loves me so much. I think that my brothers do though. Speaking of brothers, I rode out with my brother Eric yesterday and that was really fun. I think that if I wasn't so caught up in money and status I would become a paramedic instead of a doctor. Oh well maybe I'll become an ER doctor. That would be pretty cool. I just watched ER tonight and it was pretty good. Mark Green reminds me of Eric's friend Jim, he's really nice but he is married to a psycho just like Eric is. I used to want to be a psychiatrist but after last night I defiantly don't want to do that. We ran a call on a girl that over dosed on her anxiety medication. All she did was whine about how no one loved her and all of her friends had boyfriends, just like Sunni. Sometimes I wish that I could be a writer like JD Salinger. He is really awesome. I know that this sounds really morbid but I almost can't wait for him to die so that we can read more of his work. And if that sounded bad another person that could keel over at any given moment is ""Deep throat,"" from the Nixon scandal, I would really like to know who that is. I really don't want these people to die, I mean I wouldn't wish that on anyone, I just would like to find out some more things. Oh well I have about two more minutes and I can stop writing this. I'm glad that no one is going to read it because that would be really embarrassing. I can't believe how much stuff I am misspelling. It's like I never attended first grade. Well I did fail spelling in the fifth grade but doesn't that make me a genius?",0
"A cento
Is there no when where this dream will rest?Blue smoke, wings, a plague
of  walls, the city motionless, massof mind and angst rising
in the brilliance of a cloudless light[le ciel, c’est mauve comme la lavande].
Everything turns in the quiet leisure of disaster:a kind of innocence
now supernatural darkness floating,trees shaking, waterways
swollen under a livid sky, storm cloudsforming in the blink of an eye.
The thought of you is performative: blondehair, pale complexion, downcast
jewels for eyes. Your dreadful martyrdomruns its course, written in mud
and butter: the human instant, in whichyou sing yourself full-throated.
Honey, ginger, flared saffron, graywhitemomentous rhythm of sea,
barbarous smell of wet earth, ransackingor ravaged flowers, the landfill
site, shit-hole, killing ground from which we supas shaking, hiccuping drunks.
To forfeit wisdom, atone for sins undone:the allegorical
hand thrust into torture, noise, shadowsof men. Between the lines,
against the clock, this does not make,does not make a difference to them.
This age [our age] demands an image of itsaccelerated grimace —
an old bitch gone in the teeth, the ultimatecunt — our botched
civilization, our grave in the sky: last jizzof consciousness.
I could have, now, blown my fucking brains out,but for a sweet shimmer of reason,
blood, lone bells in gritty belfries, the shallowsof the sea, the surprise of days
which slide under sunlight, the soulgathered up, exhaled as rings of smoke.
Clay is the word and clay is the flesh. Youdrape your body against
my body, like a sheet of mirrored glass;you remain, comme le ditFlaubert, melancholique devant son rêve accompli. — The word “red” is not.
Forever in lust, forever in heat of fire and flood.Mule-bray, pig-grunt, bawdy
cackle and the stomping of feet to the beatof some undone family portrait
— bad teeth, bad eyes, beer and paint cans — the name and date split in soft slate.
Money makes an inverse differenceto distance, when I lift her back
to me now: nothing there but that palecurly head, working
a machine up and down, an ochreautumn merging into twilight.
I read much of the night. Guns click and spitand split up timber, until
the river’s tent is broken: old kettles, oldbottles, a broken can, old iron,
old bones, old rags, that raving slutwho kept the till.
Dreams nourished with tears, the sweet kinksof fists, light rain falling as mist.
The hours after you are gone are a leadwhite morning of  hard, new ice,
the snow drift of that which is left unspoken.Care and great sadness are both a burden.
No gods, but a black swastika and no skybut grinding water, gasping
wind, the wares of carthage, girlswith peacock eyes. The churn
of stale words staining the heart again:bleached wood massed as bones.
Your body is white as anemone petals,your skin is stone smooth, we
[as cold as the dead they loadlike a pile of  baskets, mound
of refuse, the sweepings of a street]are pressed close together, swaying.
Merely the despaired occasion of wordshedmade keener by blessed rage.
Scrape away the prison coating, the itchysea; drink from this glass
of pure, real, resplendent blood, itsmalediction, freshly soiled and snug.
It’s a question of altitude, probably, walkingalong your eyelid again, towards
your tear duct. This dance of firethat touches our lips, scorches
our tongues and pulls out the thinbeaten tin of my squally voice.
O technosociety, where memory is tolerated,barely, as real estate
on which to mount steeples of rust, layfresh mowed grass, burn gasoline:
anything so long as there’s a marginand little but commerce between us.
We never have pure space in front of us, rather:slight bondage, the world’s halter,
this fashion for dressing or setting our hairablaze until we’re ash and ash
in the heat of a blank but infinitely scrollingscreen, flared back to scratch.
We begin and end with a groan, the tongue’scomfortable wetness, sureness
of soul and fluttering lips. Then:lords of unquiet, quiet sojourn,
each atom which belongs to youbelongs to me.
All abandoned, the last rig broken, the staggeringshadows of trees, fence posts, gutted
cars, faces blurred and Sienese grave.I wish that I could speak only
of  it all, the voices of children singing.A chapel, in spite of  it all.",0
"Gentle, delicate, a lover's caress,
Intimate moments, nothing can express,
Electric sparks that light up the skin,
A touch that makes your heart begin.

Fingers tracing through hair so fine,
Every touch sends shivers down the spine,
Whispers of love that lull to sleep,
Caressing arms, ever soft and deep.

Tender kisses, a trail down the neck,
A touch so light it leaves just a speck,
The skin alive with every sensation,
A moment shared, the ultimate temptation.

Touch, a language that speaks so much,
A connection that fills the heart's clutch,
In your arms, I feel at home,
A touch that never leaves me alone.",1

"Oh, how I love the taste of mango,
Juicy and sweet, its flavor aglow.
Its vibrant color, a sunny yellow,
Is sure to banish any shadow.

Peeling back its skin with ease,
Reveals an inner flesh that's a breeze
To eat, with its texture so sublime,
It's a true treat every time.

Summer days are made for mangoes,
Their tropical flavor a favorite, you know.
Savoring each bite, my taste buds elated,
A moment in bliss, not to be underrated.

Mango, you are a true delight,
Your taste and aroma such a sight.
A fruit I'll always enjoy, with fervor,
A true star in the fruit basket forever.",1
"Beneath the surface of the sea,
Lurks a creature that haunts me,
A fish with razor-sharp teeth,
Its eyes staring, full of deceit.

I cannot name this fish I fear,
For its very presence draws near,
My heart beats fast, my palms sweat,
As I struggle with my own threat.

Its scales gleam in the dim light,
Sending shivers down my spine in fright,
I cannot look away from its gaze,
Its presence a haunting, endless maze.

I try to swim away, but alas,
It follows me, with steady grace,
My fear only fuels its desire,
To catch me with its jaws afire.

This fish, it seems, will never rest,
Until I am its helpless guest,
And so I flee, with all my might,
Away from this thing that haunts my night.

But still, it lurks in my mind,
A creature that forever binds,
Its very presence, a haunting pain,
A memory that I can never drain.",1
"Tick-tock, the clock goes round,
As precious seconds pass us by,
Time is a concept so profound,
A fleeting moment, it can't deny.

Yesterday, it's just a memory,
And tomorrow, it's yet to come,
Today is all we ever see,
Our present moment, a precious sum.

From birth until the day we die,
Time ticks away, never to stop,
With every breath that we sigh,
Our heartbeats keep the beat of the clock.

Time waits for no one, they say,
It marches on with steady pace,
So let's make every moment count,
Before this life becomes a waste.

Memories are all that remain,
Of the moments that we hold dear,
The laughter, the joy, the pain,
All captured in time, so clear.

So let's not waste a single second,
In this fleeting time we call life,
Let's embrace each moment, reckoned,
And make the most of this precious strife.

For time is a gift, we must cherish,
And hold it close, like a treasure divine,
For every moment that we bearish,
Is a moment lost, never to shine.",1
"okay today is friday at 2:25 and at the moment I am wondering what I will be doing this weekend. I am going home on saturday with my best friend. my best friend is catherine, but now she prefers to be called cat. I have known her since I moved to kingwood (north of h-town) 5 years ago. she was my first friend and we have been through a lot together. we've also had our years of separation too. she lives a street away from me. I am listening to the cure. but the tape sucks because I used to listen to it in my car and my car's stereo sucked. now I don't even have that car. we sold it the weekend before I moved to austin. which brings me to the topic of austin. austin always seemed like such a cool place before I moved here. now that I actually live here, I wish I was back in houston. in houston I knew so many people and there was almost always something to do. and most of my friends stayed there. it's really fucking hard to meet people here since there are so many people. ironic. I have not given up yet. I guess I just have to go out more. hey psychology is my fav class. I hate math and chem is just like math to me. I used to like english in high school but now it's goofy stuff like ""everything's an argument"". I bought some ginseng today and I donot think it works. I am still tired. I am looking around my room for things to talk about because thoughts do not pop into my head unless I am looking around. I just remembered I have been having really fucked up dreams. last nite I had my 2nd weird dream. in the first one I almost died and everyone acted really strange. my second dream a lamb was killed in front of me. and there was some blue gel that was everywhere. I can't really explain it and it would take too long and I have only 8 minutes left. since I am a slacker and only do the minimum 20. I drank sobe lizard blizzard today and it was good. I think it was pina colada. right before I did this assignment, someone called and I could not understand them because the were those people who mumble. anyways I thought they were doing a survey so I went ahead and cooperated. well it turns out I was filling a visa credit card application over the phone and she told me I would get my card in a couple of weeks. I thought it was funny because I do not want a credit card and was going to tell her at the end but I decided not to. maybe she will get a bonus for getting a customer. I hope I am doing this assignment right. I did something like this in my high school english class. she had us smell crayons and write the first thoughts that came into our head. and thats what I did except everyone else seemed to have the same thoughts (thoughts about elementary, art school, projects). the crayons did not spark up any thoughts about my childhood. so I hope this writing assignment isn't supposed to spark some certain thoughts. supasticious.",0

" Teaching is a noble and challenging profession that requires constant learning and improvement. Teachers have a significant impact on their students’ lives and academic success, so they need to use effective methods and strategies to facilitate learning and engagement. In this essay, I will describe some of the techniques or methods that could help teachers do their job more effectively.  One of the techniques that teachers can use is online learning. Online learning is the process of educating others using the internet, whether that’s through video calls, webinars, or messaging platforms1. Online learning can be beneficial for both teachers and students, as it offers flexibility, accessibility, and variety. Teachers can create digital resources for their students, such as presentations, videos, or worksheets, and use different tools and platforms to deliver them. Students can access these resources at their own pace and convenience, and interact with their teachers and peers through online forums or chats. Online learning can also help teachers reach more students who may not be able to attend school due to various reasons1.  Another technique that teachers can use is experiential learning. Experiential learning is the idea that learning is a product of direct experience rather than passive observation2. Experiential learning can help students develop critical thinking, problem-solving, and creativity skills, as well as learn from their mistakes and reflect on their actions2. Teachers can use experiential learning methods such as experiments, simulations, games, field trips, or projects to engage students in active learning and connect theory to practice. Experiential learning can be effective for several subjects, especially during science experiments, sports coaching, and group projects1.  A third technique that teachers can use is gamification. Gamification is the application of game elements and principles to non-game contexts, such as education3. Gamification can help teachers make learning more fun and motivating for students by using rewards, challenges, feedback, and competition. Teachers can use gamification techniques such as quizzes, badges, leaderboards, or points to enhance student participation and retention. Gamification can also help teachers differentiate instruction and assessment according to the needs and preferences of different students3.  In conclusion, teaching is a complex and dynamic process that requires effective methods and techniques to achieve optimal results. Some of the techniques that teachers can use are online learning, experiential learning, and gamification. These techniques can help teachers create engaging and meaningful learning experiences for their students and support their academic achievements.   ",1
"I'm thinking about what I need to do before classes start again, but every time I  get started, something interrupts me or I just don't feel like doing it. I'm sitting in my  room in front of my awesome new computer listening to the 'Wicked"" soundtrack,  it's amazing. my room smelled before, but I cleaned the kitchen so now it doesn't  smell anymore. stacy just walked in my room and I yelled at her because I am not  supposed to be disturbed during my writing assignments. I'm feeling kind of gross,  actually. I feel gross because it's the end of the weekend and I was out partying  the whole time. I hate when people are like, ""yeah I party"", but I seriously did the  whole weekend. now I feel dirty and gross. I also ate like crap this whole weekend. ew. during the week I'm so healthy and so conscious of what I eat, and then the  weekend comes and it's like I've never seen food before. what is that about? so  now I feel gross because I feel like I ate the entire state of texas and I'm disgusting. I'll get over it. I kind of miss camp right now, even though I would never go back. I  miss sam israel and hilly and weisberg. those three are like my favorite people in  the world. this time seems to be going by so slowly. I feel like I've been writing  forever and I haven't. weird. so back to camp. I miss it because I was so  comfortable and so happy. here, I'm not used to everything yet. and I miss those  three girls because I know that they will always be there and I've known them  forever. I'm still getting to know people here, which is fun because I love to meet  new people, but sometimes I long for that feeling of comfort and not having to  impress or look good for anyone. you know what I mean? and I also miss adam. this is something I could talk about for a while but I don't really know if I want to. it's  our 4 year anniversary in a couple of days but the card and present that I sent him  won't get there on the 8th, I feel kind of bad about that. what can I do? it was so  weird when ross called me the other night, what the f? I'm running out of things to  talk about. I love traci, my suitemate. I knew her from camp and I'm really glad we  decided to live together. despite what everyone said, I knew it would be a good  decision. we've been getting along really well. I'm thinking about ""friends"" right  now because it's my favorite show. I love it so much, and I'm so sad that it's over. but I'm excited to watch ""joey"" on Thursday. I'm definitely going to support him even if  the show sucks, though I doubt it will. this is random but I'm going to run out of soap  and shampoo soon, I'm going to have to go to eckerd's to buy more, and I need to  return some books to the co-op outlet because there were some books that I didn't  need. hopefully I'll get store credit, and then I can buy some stuff. that would be  awesome! I need to return my chemistry and old psychology book. I found out that  I was in the chemistry class for science majors, and let me tell you that I'm the  furthest thing from a science major. I hate science. well I don't hate it but I definitely  don't belong in that class. so I switched into chemistry in context which is for sure  more my pace. and I actually swtiched into this class after classes had started and  I found out that I bought the wrong book. I just figured something out about me. I  hate bad spellers. so random, I know, but I see myself typing and every time I'm  about to spell something wrong or I mistype, I get so angry. I don't know how  people can just leave words mispelled. I hope nobody reads this because they'll  think I'm such a weird kid. which I am, but not everyone needs to know that. my  brother, danny, always tells me I'm a weird kid. he's so funny. and whenever I talk  about him to other people, they always ask how old he is, and then they are  surprised when I tell them that he's 16, because the way I talk about him, it sounds  like he's older. danny always gives me orders and bosses me around, but in a  funny way, not in a serious way. people always make fun of our family by calling  us the ""brady bunch"" because  no one ever seems to fight in my family. I don't  know why, but we all just get along. my older sister is my best friend in the entire  world. sure, we get annoyed with each other every once in  a while, but she is  absolutely the first person that I go to with a problem and she's the first person I tell  things to. and danny is awesome. there's nothing not to like about him. he's so  cute, nice, smart, funny, he's a great catch. some day, girls are going to fall all over  him. they should. me and andi (my sister) always say that we would date danny if  he wasn't our brother. he's such a cute kid. I'm kind of mad at him though because  I haven't talked to him in a really long time and he said that he would call me and  he didn't. I hate when people do that. I really don't know what else to talk about. I  guess I can go through my high school friends and talk about them because then  I'll have plenty to say. I hope that's still following the assignment. so I'll start with  olivia geyelin. I don't even know why I'm writing about her because she sucks. I  mean, I hate this girl. she might be the dumbest person I know, and she's always  complaining and never knows what's going on. she gets mad at everyone for the  dumbest reasons. ew. but I kind of feel bad for her because she's got the worst  family life ever. ok I'm sick of olivia, now I'll talk about rikki spreckman. ok, I used to  love rikki, she was so sweet and nice and always smiling. and then I realized how  selfish and dumb she was. I hate sounding like a bitch but I' m starting with the  people I like the least and working my way to the good ones. ok so rikki, sweet girl,  adorable, but so dumb. and she's best friends with hillary, who I'll come back to  later, but it annoys me because hillary's one of my best friends and I hate how  much time they spend together. I'm not jealous, I just know that hillary could do so  much better than rikki, but rikki seems to need hillary. and I feel bad for hill  because a lot of people don't like rikki, and so they're always talking about her and  then people assume that because hill is so close with her that she sucks too,  which is so not true. but I've known rikki since junior high. ok now on to sarah  salon. I used to hate sarah. she's a bitch. not kidding. and she's intimidating as  hell, but only if you take her seriously. now I like her a lot more because I'm not  scared of her and I don't take her shit. she has two older sisters who might be the  meanest people ever, and she tries to act like them but she's so much better than  them. sarah had a boyfriend for a really long time, and so her and I were always  able to have really great conversations about boiyfriends and relationships. she's  always so much fun to be around. I like her. but her and rikki had this whole feud  going for a while and all she would do was talk about rikki and how much she  hated her. I'm wondering if this timing thing is accurate because I really feel like  I've been doing this forever and every time I'm typing, it seems like the seconds  don't go by, but every time I pause, the seconds go by quickly. maybe it's in my  head, I don't know. but it's weird. I'm going to start looking at another clock to see  how much time has gone by. ok after sarah, I only have favorites left. everyone  else left, I genuinely love, they're my best friends. I'll start with lizzie albert. Elizabeth Chandler Albert. I met lizzie freshman year and we were instantly best  friends. I'm not kidding, I loved her so much and we could always talk about  anything and laughed so much together it was ridiculous. and we were always on  the same intellectual level because we were pretty much the same (but she was  smarter). in our group of friends, we were the smartest. we were bff, I swear and  then junior year, our friends kind of got in this fight and we didn't talk for a really  long time. it really bothered me. I'm not joking. it killed me that she didn't want to  talk to me and I didn't understand. it was so bad. we were never the same again. but at the end of senior year, we got close again, and now I think we're really  close, like reverting back to three years ago. I miss her so much, she goes to  wisconsin. she's probably having the best time. I can't wait to go visit her. she's so  funny, I always have a great time whenever I'm with her. Love her. ok after lizzie  comes simone. I met simone actually a long time ago. Maybe in 1997. she came  to camp and we were good friends, we were in the same cabin. then she stopped  going to camp and I didn't see her again until I was in high school. then we  became best friends. I LOVE simone. she cracks me up and is so great. we finish  each other's sentences, she reminds me of my mom so much, she's like another  sister to me. we took this class together called 20th century history and literature,  and it was the best class that I have ever taken. I'm so glad that we were able to be  in that class together. I hate sounding cheesy but it's true. there's no one I'd rather  be in 20th with than simone. simone's dad died the day before her 5th birthday,  and so she lives with her mom. she has two sisters, so the four girls are pretty  close. her mom works all the time so I feel like simone's ahead of all of us, she's  already an adult. she does things by herself and is really mature. love her. she  goes to bradley which is so good for her. I really hope she's happy. she rocks my  world. after simone comes marisa. LOVE marisa. we always knew each other but  weren't really friends until about sophomore year. then the end of junior year and  all of senior year we were like inseperable. we were best friends. me, simone,  lizzie and marisa were a foursome. she's so funny, so sweet, loooooves to talk. I  love her family and going over to her house because I always have a good time  when I'm there. marisa was the kid who was on the fast track, if you know what I  mean. she had sex when she was 12 or 13, had a cell phone before everyone,  never really had any rules. Which the exact opposite of me. but she's great and I  love her. she has parties and her house is always the one we go back to after  dances and stuff. marisa and I went to breakfast every Saturday morning of our  senior year. that makes me so sad that I don't get to do that anymore. she goes to  indiana, and she loves it. both her parents went there and loved it. her mom was  president of aephi there, so she won't have any problems getting into the sorority. marisa goes with the flow, she's not uptight or anal about much. she's actually  underrated anal but I won't tell anyone about that. love her. and last, I'll talk about  Hillary. I love her. I've known her since the early days at camp marimeta. she was  always the little girl that everybody loved. we didn't become friends until we were  older and then became like best friends junior and senior year. she' so great. I  honestly love her and miss her so much. she wanted to go here so badly and  didn't get in. Ass holes. but I don't think she would have come here anyways. I can  talk to hillary about everything. I love her. she goes to illinois. I can't wait to go visit  her. she's so fun and we'll have the best time partying, but I also can't wait to just  talk with her and lay on her bed. she's so funny and a great person to be with. we're very similar in a lot of ways and I just think that she's great. the first time I  came to visit texas she came with me. and we were on poms together. She was  even my big sister one year. I miss poms. and I miss hill, I need to call her actually  because I miss her so much. she's so cute and so talented. she's the best dancer  ever and she has a really great voice but she doesn't really sing anymore. sometimes I make her sing to me, but she doesn't sing for a lot of people. ok so  now that I only have about a minute left I can talk about adam. adam jeffrey silver. I  met the kid the first day of high school. I was like, damn he's hot. we were in like 3  classes together and our last names are close so we sat next to each other. we  exchanged phone numbers, he asked me to homecoming and we dated ever  since. he's my best friend in the entire world. he knows me better than even I know  myself and more than my sister knows me. he's so special to me and I know that  I'm in love with him and that I will always love him. I miss him so much. sometimes  I don't' know what to do with myself because I miss him so much but I know it's the  right thing to be with other people right now. how else are we supposed to know if  we're really right for each other? this is the time to find out , you know? well, it's  been great. see you later",0
"Eleanor Vachell (1879–1948) was a Welsh botanist who is remembered especially for her work identifying and studying the flora of Glamorgan and her connection with the National Museum of Wales where she was the first woman to be a member of its Council and Court of Governors. The museum now holds her botanical diary, notes, books, records and specimens. Early life  She was the eldest child of Winifred and Charles Tanfield Vachell, a physician in Cardiff where she was born in 1879, followed in the 1890s by her brother Eustace and sister Sylvia. She went to school in Cardiff, Malvern, and Brighton. Her father was a keen amateur botanist, and from childhood she went with him on botanical trips across the UK and Ireland as well as in Brittany, Norway and Switzerland. She started keeping a botanical diary when she was twelve and used it throughout her life to record expeditions and finds. Her ambition was to see in situ every plant recognised as a British species and she ticked off her finds by colouring illustrations in a reference book. This eventually led to her building up an almost unrivalled knowledge of UK and Irish plants in their native habitats. It is believed she saw all but thirteen species during her life.",0
" Weather conditions such as heavy rain, snow, fog, or ice can significantly impact the time and effort required to travel to school. Poor visibility and slick road conditions can make it more challenging to drive, increasing the risk of accidents and delays. Walking or biking to school may also be more difficult or even dangerous in inclement weather.  Extreme temperatures can also affect a commute. In hot weather, high humidity and direct sunlight can make it uncomfortable to travel, while cold weather can lead to slippery roads or sidewalks and longer warm-up times for vehicles. Additionally, public transportation may experience delays due to weather-related issues, such as flooding or fallen trees blocking tracks.  Overall, weather conditions can have a significant impact on the ease and safety of a commute to school, and it's important to plan accordingly and allow for extra time in case of delays or unexpected issues.

"Where’er thy navy spreads her canvas wings, Homage to thee, and peace to all, she brings: The French and Spaniard, when thy flags appear, Forget their hatred, and consent to fear. So Jove from Ida did both hosts survey, And when he pleas’d to thunder, part the fray. Ships heretofore in seas like fishes sped, The mightiest still upon the smallest fed: Thou on the deep imposest nobler laws, And by that justice hast remov’d the cause Of those rude tempests, which, for rapine sent, Too oft, alas, involv’d the innocent. Now shall the ocean, as thy Thames, be free From both those fates, of storms and piracy. But we most happy, who can fear no force But winged troops, or Pegasean horse: ’Tis not so hard for greedy foes to spoil Another nation, as to touch our soil. Should Nature’s self invade the world again, And o’er the centre spread the liquid main, Thy power were safe; and her destructive hand Would but enlarge the bounds of thy command: Thy dreadful fleet would style thee lord of all, And ride in triumph o’er the drowned ball: Those towers of oak o’er fertile plains might go, And visit mountains, where they once did grow.          The world’s restorer once could not endure, That finish’d Babel should those men secure, Whose pride design’d that fabric to have stood Above the reach of any second flood: To thee His chosen, more indulgent, He Dares trust such power with so much piety.",0
"The child I left your class to have
Later had a habit of sleeping
With her arms around a globe
She’d unscrewed, dropped, and dented.
I always felt she could possess it,
The pink countries and the mauve
And the ocean which got to keep its blue.
Coming from the Southern Hemisphere to teach,
Which you had never had to do, you took
A bare-walled room, alone, its northern
Windowscapes as gray as walls.
To decorate, you’d only brought a black madonna.
I thought you must have skipped summer that year,
Southern winter, southern spring, then north
For winter over again. Still, it pleased you
To take credit for introducing us,
And later to bring our daughter a small flipbook
Of partners dancing, and a ring
With a secret whistle. —All are
Broken now like her globe, but she remembers
Them as I recall the black madonna
Facing you across the room so that
In a way you had the dark fertile life
You were always giving gifts to.
Your smaller admirer off to school,
I take the globe and roll it away: where
On it now is someone like you?",0
