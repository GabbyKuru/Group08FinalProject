" Yes, I agree that we can lie with silence as well as with words. Silence can be used to deceive, manipulate, and conceal the truth just as effectively as words.  For example, consider a scenario where a friend asks another friend if they like their new outfit. The friend doesn't say anything, and their silence can be interpreted in different ways. They might not like the outfit but don't want to hurt their friend's feelings, or they might not care about the outfit at all. Alternatively, they might like the outfit but are too shy to say anything. In any case, their silence can be interpreted in multiple ways, and the interpretation might not be the truth.  Another example is when someone remains silent instead of speaking up when they witness injustice or unethical behavior. This silence can be seen as complicit and can contribute to the perpetuation of harmful actions. In this case, silence is a form of lying by omission.  In conclusion, silence can be just as powerful as words when it comes to conveying meaning, and it can be used to deceive or manipulate just as effectively as words can. It's essential to be aware of the potential for deception through silence and to communicate clearly to avoid misunderstandings.    ",1
" I can provide you with some information that may help you form your own opinion on this issue.  The debate on whether sport fishing is cruel and should be abolished is a controversial one. Animal rights activists argue that sport fishing causes unnecessary pain and suffering to fish, and that it is a cruel and inhumane practice. On the other hand, some argue that sport fishing is a legitimate and enjoyable activity, and that it can actually promote conservation efforts.  Those who oppose sport fishing argue that fish are sentient beings, capable of experiencing pain and suffering. They argue that sport fishing causes fish to experience significant stress and pain, and that it can result in serious injury or death for the fish. They also argue that fish do not receive the same level of protection as other animals, and that this is a form of speciesism.  Supporters of sport fishing, on the other hand, argue that it is a legitimate recreational activity that can actually promote conservation efforts. They argue that many anglers practice catch-and-release fishing, in which the fish is returned to the water after it has been caught. This allows fish populations to be maintained and even increased, as fish have the opportunity to reproduce and grow to maturity.  In addition, many anglers argue that sport fishing is an important part of our cultural heritage, and that it provides important economic benefits to local communities. Fishing tourism, for example, can bring in significant revenue to areas that are otherwise economically disadvantaged.  Ultimately, whether or not sport fishing should be abolished is a matter of personal opinion. While there are valid arguments on both sides of the issue, it is important to consider the potential impact on fish populations, as well as the ethical implications of the practice. It is also important to consider the potential economic and cultural benefits of sport fishing, as well as the potential risks and benefits of alternative approaches to managing fish populations.

" As an AI language model, I don't have personal preferences, so I don't have a favorite author, sports figure or performer. However, I can discuss the life events of a well-known sports figure, Serena Williams, and how they relate to her achievements.  Serena Williams is a professional tennis player, widely regarded as one of the greatest athletes of all time. She was born on September 26, 1981, in Saginaw, Michigan. Serena began playing tennis at a very young age, under the tutelage of her father, Richard Williams.  Throughout her career, Serena has faced numerous challenges and setbacks. In 2003, she suffered a knee injury that kept her off the court for several months. She bounced back in 2004, winning the Australian Open, Wimbledon, and the US Open.  In 2010, Serena suffered a pulmonary embolism, which caused her to miss almost a year of competition. However, she returned to the court in 2011 and won two Grand Slam titles that year.  In 2017, Serena announced her pregnancy and took a break from the sport. She gave birth to her daughter, Olympia, in September of that year. Serena returned to tennis in 2018, and despite struggling with postpartum complications, she made it to the Wimbledon and US Open finals that year.  Throughout her career, Serena has won 23 Grand Slam singles titles, the most by any player in the Open Era, and 14 Grand Slam doubles titles with her sister Venus Williams. She has also won four Olympic gold medals in doubles and one in singles.  Serena's achievements on the court are a testament to her determination and resilience. Despite facing numerous obstacles, she has continued to work hard and remain focused on her goals. Her dedication to her sport, her mental toughness, and her ability to overcome adversity have made her a role model for aspiring athletes around the world.        ",1
"So I'm not sure on what I'm supposed to be typing about. What I smell, taste, feel like??? Well I'm chewing gum. I've been chewing it for over like 3 hours now. I hate it when gum starts to get really hard in your mouth. My gum got hard a long time ago. But somehow the flavor is still intact. It's weird though- like with some gum, the flavor is gone after you chew it for like literally 2 minutes. However, I've noticed that Wrigley's chewing gum tends to have flavor for a very long time. There are many pictures on my wall. I stuck all these pics up like 2 days ago. There are pictures of my friends, one of my dog, and one of me and my sis. I don't have one of my family up there. I kind of feel bad in a way. But I don't think it's necessary to have them up on the board. I have a picture of them in my drawer if I ever need to see them. But I think it's better with them in my drawer. Every time I look up at these pictures of all my friends, I miss them like no other. Man, I had so much fun last year, in high school in general. But last year was definitely the best year. Man, me, Caroline, and Shaheen in government and Spanish. Those were some good times. I kind of even miss my teachers. And our elephants and doing SCN all the time. We have so many inside jokes. And although I'm sure I'll see Caroline again, I'm afraid that when I meet her things won't be the same. And for some reason I'm scared of that. I hope I can go to LSU in the spring. Or actually, I hope Caroline can come to Houston for Thanksgiving. Or both would be the best. And we can't forget about going to Europe next summer. I'm so used to traveling with friends because we always went on vacation with Xerx and Zahra. But now with this whole separation thing, I know that our traveling days with the Tegra family are over. Those were some fun trips too. I feel so blessed to have a friend like Xerx. And even Zubin and stuff. People that I've known my whole life. That even know I don't see them too often, when I do, you can tell that there's something there. Like I feel so close to them cause I practically grew up with them and their parents are like my parents. It's a really nice feeling. I'm also blessed for Shenz and the whole family. God, Shenz and Fred really do care about me and Tash like we were their own kids. And just knowing that really means a lot to me. And I hope that mom feels the same way about Zareen cause that would only be fair. So we're talking about fairness in my freshman seminar class and I'm thinking that maybe this class isn't going to be that easy after all. But I love the Professor; we call him Dr. EO. Hahaha, he's really cool. Like I walk into his class and he's like ""do you want a drink?"" Wow, I was like thinking ""what is this?"" Oh, and his classroom is in his office which have weird scary looking statues of people's heads. The office kind of reminds me of the The Vinci Code. I don't know why, maybe the whole ""Louvre"" idea. I always say I hate France and stuff but I really don't. I just think it's kind of funny to say that. But I really don't know why it's funny. But I mean I've said it so many times now that I really think I've instilled the idea into my head. Like I really don't want to travel to France in the summer. But I mean if Caroline wants to, then I really don't care. I think I'm pretty easy going when it comes to life. Like about my grades- I mean if I don't so well in college, what's going to happen to me? I mean, I'm still going to get a job and all, hopefully get into a good grad school. But I mean if for whatever reason I don't, then I think I'll be ok. I mean, it's not like I'm going to die or anything. Plus, if I have my own family then I don't think I'll be able to work and have the kids and stuff. Man, it's a complicated issue. We got a phone in our room, the same one I had in my room at home. But I haven't used it once here. If anything, Jennifer has used it way more than me. Man, I haven't even given anyone the number to this phone cause I don't want them calling in case they call when I'm not here and then have to talk to Jennifer. I'm not sure what I'm more afraid of, them talking to Jennifer or Jennifer talking to them. No, but Jennifer's really cool. But so is Joanna's roommate. Man, I wish I had a roommate like her. Dude, me and Jennifer need to start hanging out more often. But I never want us to have the same friends. John is one of Jennifer's friends. Majoring in Japanese and stuff. Wow, that's cool, especially since he's white and all. I've always wanted to take some random language like Japanese. I don't know, it's like you gain more respect if you fluently learn a language that is so not from where you are. Like me learning a African language and spe",0
"I know I should probably find this sort of assignment intriguing,"" but really I'm just bored as hell. I think I can honestly say that I never imagined myself doing something like this. I guess it's something I always imagined only druggies and insomniacs did. Then again, I consider myself an insomniac. But like I said. here we are. My only motivation for doing this is that my roommate has promised me that after I finish my writing assignment, we can go to lunch. How sad. She is like my mom. She wakes me up in the mornings when I oversleep, she keeps track of my assignments for the classes we have together, she cleans the room. and even sadder. Food is my only motivation. Meh. In other news, the UT Body Project is going well. I got paid $30 for the seminar I attended yesterday. They want us to ""diet"" for the next week, though they stress that it's not ""diet[ing],"" but more ""finding a homeostasis"" in the course of our daily consumptions. Somehow I don't see that happening. On a lighter note, my new computer is totally freaking super awesome. It's great having a computer that doesn't restart every day, and actually has enough memory to complete whole tasks. My poor baby. I'm not too sure what to do with my old computer. So for now, it's sitting in a Dell box in the middle of my room, taking up space. So it's hard for me to access my closet. But oh well. Who needs clothes anyway. My roommate is sick right now. asking for tissues. This could be a disaster. She is also trying to read what I'm writing, claiming that I'm talking trash about her. . Everything she is heard is true. And, because I'm confident in the fact that no one is going to read this, and on the off chance that they do, they won't give a shit, I'll delve a little bit into my personal life. I wrote an e-mail to S (as we'll call him for now) while he was gone. Though he wasn't technically gone. He went to Harvard for college, and his computer had not yet arrived. Speaking of which, because Harvard is gay, their holiday breaks are all messed up. so they just started school, and while we get out of school on the 7th of may, they don't get out till the 25th I think. It sux0rz. Fortunately, I asked Arjun, and their spring break doesn't coincide with ours. Which means. my roommate Angela and I might go visit them up in Boston during our spring break, if there's enough money, and if we care. But I digress. Then again I guess the point of this is to digress, so by not digressing I actually am digressing. OK I'm not going to confuse myself further. Anyway. back to the e-mail. Right. So I wrote it, and he got back on Tuesday, as he said he would. But by the I'd already gotten my new computer, and installed it and everything. Unfortunately, I don't have the proper network cable to network my computers just yet, so it's still on my old POS computer. Oh well. It wasn't anything important. just a stream-of-consciousness type thing, a lot like this. Except a lot longer. I forget what the point of this story was. Oh well. I guess what I'm trying to say is that a) the Donnie Darko soundtrack is very good, and b) I miss him a lot. A lot a lot. He is going to have fun up at Harvard with his friends, while I'm stuck down here with no ability to make friends whatsoever. It's so depressing. I don't really like it down here. I miss Saikat, and Arjun, and Amit. Bah. I really need to update my journal sometime soon. I think oftentimes, I make such an effort to make the entries I write so pensive, and thought-provoking, that if I'm ever experiencing writer's block, or whatever, I just won't update. What a shame. I need to stop caring about how I write and start worrying about what I write. People don't need to read something well-written to be able to enjoy it. Then again, what's to convince myself that my entries are interesting anyway. Oh poo. In other news, the movie ""The Good Girl"" is really good. It helped me to explore some aspects of my life that I'd never given much thought to. I guess I should have.",0
" Benjamin Franklin's statement suggests that money cannot bring happiness. While it is true that money alone cannot guarantee happiness, it is also true that financial stability and security can contribute significantly to a person's overall well-being. Studies have shown that poverty and financial stress are strongly associated with negative health outcomes, such as depression, anxiety, and physical health problems.  On the other hand, it is also true that having a large amount of money does not necessarily lead to happiness. Many wealthy people still struggle with mental health issues, relationship problems, and other personal challenges that money cannot solve.  In essence, the relationship between money and happiness is complex and multifaceted. While financial stability and security can improve a person's well-being, it is only one factor among many that contribute to overall happiness. Other factors, such as relationships, purpose, and a sense of meaning and fulfillment, are also essential to a happy life.  Ultimately, the role of money in happiness depends on the individual and their unique circumstances. For some people, financial stability may be a crucial factor in their happiness, while for others, it may not matter as much. It is important to recognize that happiness is a subjective experience and cannot be reduced to any single factor, including money.         ",1

Prejudice can have many causes and effects, some of which are discussed below:  Causes of prejudice:  Socialization: Prejudice can be learned from family members, friends, and society at large. Children may pick up discriminatory attitudes and beliefs from their parents or peers.  Stereotyping: Prejudice often stems from stereotypes, which are oversimplified and distorted images of a group of people.  Fear and insecurity: Prejudice can arise from fear of the unknown or from a desire to protect one's own group.  Lack of contact: Prejudice can be reinforced by lack of contact with members of other groups, which leads to misunderstandings and mistrust.  Effects of prejudice:  Discrimination: Prejudice can lead to discrimination, where individuals are treated unfairly or unjustly based on their membership in a particular group.  Low self-esteem: Prejudice can negatively affect the self-esteem of individuals who are targeted by discriminatory attitudes and behaviors.  Conflict: Prejudice can lead to conflict and tension between groups, which can escalate into violence and social unrest.  Inequality: Prejudice can contribute to inequality in areas such as employment, education, and housing, where members of certain groups may face barriers or disadvantages.  Overall, prejudice has harmful effects on individuals and society at large. It is important to recognize and challenge our own prejudices, and to work towards promoting equality, respect, and understanding among all people.  ",1
" If I were to choose one professional to travel aboard the next space station, I would select a scientist. Scientists have a unique skill set that could be extremely valuable in space exploration. They have the ability to analyze and interpret data, problem-solve, and conduct experiments to further our understanding of the universe.  For example, a scientist could study the effects of long-term space travel on the human body, investigate the possibility of extraterrestrial life, or conduct experiments on materials and technologies that could be used in space exploration.  Additionally, scientists are trained to work methodically and meticulously, which is essential in the often high-risk and complex environment of space exploration. They can also work collaboratively with other astronauts and professionals from different fields to achieve a common goal.  Overall, I believe that sending a scientist to the next space station would be a wise choice, as they could contribute greatly to our understanding of the universe and help us advance our capabilities in space exploration.

"last night I laid down and I Couldn't go to sleep for anything. sleep would be nice right now, I have class all day today. my classes are pretty cool though. I have music psychology and ceramics. I'm good at ceramics though cause I got grounded a lot in high school. high school was fun. I have a lot of great memories. I miss my friends sometimes, but it was time to move on. I feel more free, no one knows you or anything you can do what you want and be who you are. I am finally realizing the value of that too. I think its the art . I love art its constantly running thorough my head. The way I look at everything, the way I find beauty and perspective in simple and complex things, the way I am so attracted to things that are gorgeous. not only on the outside but personalities for example and music. I am going to incubus on Wednesday and they are brilliant. its cool too cause my homework for music class is to go to a concert anyways. my music class meets too often . 4 days a week. that shit is ridiculous. I feel like I am taking 15 hours but I'm just taking 12, which allows for a job. I am going to work at the frank Erwin center hopefully . I was a waitress this summer at el Chico. I love Mexican food. I am so damn hungry right now. oops can I cuss? oh well. my stomach is rumbling and I felt it necessary. I feel tired and hungry and event the sound of punching these keys is annoying but the relief of finishing this assignment is un-explainable believe me. lately I've been dead set on being responsible and I am hell bent on making all A's , so when I can make a check on the 'old to do list, its like its lifted from my shoulders and that no joke. my back hurts so bad every day from stress. its actually kind of funny that in class we talked about the correlation between stress and the immune system because I was stressed to hell the first couple weeks of school and a couple of weeks before with bills and work and money , etc. and I could not get over a dinky little cold for 3 weeks, and now that I've gotten into the scheme of things its so much easier. its so much easier just being a sophomore in general. I remember when I moved into the dorms my freshmen year. we moved everything in and I remember after my dad left standing there looking around. I had no phone, no friends, and no clue and I think it was the scariest moment of reality in my life. but when I look back I have learned that you can't always know everything at that second. you have to give yourself time to grow and learn and not be so anxious to know it all. what is this an autobiography? I don't know I am just writing as I go along. I like to write. I write often actually, sort of like this but mainly about things no one but me cares about. I like to vent, I NEED to vent. its almost like when I write something down it jumps from my mind and onto the paper and is no longer stressing me out. I don't know maybe I'm weird. I wish I could find really unique ways of expressing myself, so I do poetry as well. but I am getting bored with this subject so lets jump to another. how about love? I am in love. I am not quick to say that either and it is not something I was trying to do or even wanted, but I have found  my soul mate believe  it or not. he is perfect, and believe me I am not naive. he is the most unique person in the world ( maybe its the ADHD ) and I love his mind because I appreciate things I cannot understand myself or find how its done, and he fascinates me. really all I want is to be fascinated, and to laugh. I love to laugh. you know those times when you just laugh your ass off so hard you cry. man that's the best. seriously. that's why I like to surround myself with people who make me laugh. I make myself laugh too. I am quite lonely during the day and end up having to entertain my head with humorous thoughts. or just dress weird and laugh inside when people give me weird looks. I love that.",0

Of course, feel free to add your own questions based on your family's unique history and traditions.      ",1
" If someone were to win the lottery, they would likely have a significant amount of money at their disposal. The first thing they should do is to consult a financial advisor to help them manage their newfound wealth. They would need to create a budget, invest wisely, and plan for the future.  After that, they might want to consider paying off any outstanding debts, such as a mortgage or student loans. They could also help their loved ones by paying off their debts or giving them monetary gifts.  They might also choose to donate some of their winnings to charitable organizations. This would allow them to make a positive impact on the world while also receiving tax benefits.  Finally, they could use some of their winnings to treat themselves and their loved ones to some well-deserved luxuries, such as a dream vacation or a new home. It's important to remember to enjoy the fruits of their labor, but to also be responsible and thoughtful with their newfound wealth. ",1
"It is not as though they dit down and say ""hey, I'm going to change who I am today, just for the fun of it!"" and if they do they aren't serious about changing. I have changed. A lot. It almost scares me how I have evolved as a person over the past several months. My thoughts have changed, how I view myself and other people, how I respond to certain situations, my opinions, beliefs, morals, attitudes; they have all been dramatically altered since this time last year. The funny thing about this is the reason why. I always considered myself to be a person set in my ways, never to step out of bounds, never to go against what I thought was socially acceptable. On a small scale, I was my own person, unique in every way, but in the scheme of life, I was right there with every other middle class high school girl. Trying to fit in, to wear the coolest clothes, listen to top 40 music, go to all the parties to make and appearance and be friends with certain people just because they were ""popular"". Then I met Cody, and I realized that there was so much more to life that what I was used to. The world wasn't one big happy carousel, spinning and singing and whoever got the prettiest horse was best. No, that's not how it was. There were problems in the world, and I realized that I had been ignorant to them, and it wasn't right. I came to realize that there is so much hatred and apathy out there, and it's tolerated. Not accepted, but tolerated, and that's wrong to. Cody taught me that it's okay to stand up for what I believe in, even if everyone else wasn't doing it, to do it for myself. Not to condone the racism, sexism, homophobia and bigotry that goes on behind closed doors. If we ignore it, it will only fester and grown until there's nothing anyone can do to stop it. I began to realize then that it doesn't matter if you're wearing Polo jeans, or if your parents just bought you a  brand new Mercedes, because in the scheme of things, it's all irrelevant and pointless. This message was made clear to me through Cody and the music we listen to. It's okay to be different, it's okay to spike your hair and pierce your eyebrow, because the people who frown upon you for doing so are the people who are afraid of change, the same people that tolerate that same hatred I previously mentioned. It's okay for me to be different as long I know that I'm doing what's rights, and the two should never be confused. You can be considered a social outcast and still contribute more to the well being of society than some big shot in his three piece armani suit, (the epitome of luxury that most people in America idolize today) sitting behind his desk letting his greed for power and money boil into hatred to the point that he will step over all those ""lower"" than him to get what he want's. This isn't right. Yet this is the American dream. What is wrong with this picture?",0
" Some argue that a parent should be a child's disciplinarian, while others believe a parent should be a child's best friend. Both approaches have their advantages and disadvantages, and ultimately the decision depends on individual circumstances and personal beliefs.  On one hand, being a child's disciplinarian can help establish boundaries, discipline, and respect for authority. Parents who take on this role may use a strict, authoritarian style of parenting, where rules are enforced and punishments are given for disobedience. This approach can help children learn self-control, responsibility, and respect for others.  For example, a parent may discipline their child for lying or breaking the rules. The child may feel upset or angry at the time, but over time they may learn that their actions have consequences and that they need to be responsible for their behavior. This can help them become more self-disciplined and mature.  On the other hand, being a child's best friend can help build a close, trusting relationship with their parent. Parents who take on this role may use a more relaxed, permissive style of parenting, where rules are flexible and negotiation is encouraged. This approach can help children feel heard, valued, and understood.  For example, a parent may listen to their child's problems, offer advice, and support them through difficult times. The child may feel more comfortable talking to their parent about their feelings and experiences, which can strengthen their bond and lead to greater trust and openness.  Ultimately, the decision of whether to be a child's disciplinarian or best friend depends on a number of factors, including the child's age, personality, and behavior, as well as the parent's own beliefs, values, and parenting style. A balanced approach that combines elements of both discipline and friendship may be the most effective for helping children grow and develop into responsible, independent adults.    ",1
" Manners refer to the social behaviors and customs that dictate how people should interact with one another. The specific customs and expectations surrounding manners have evolved significantly over time, reflecting changes in social norms, cultural values, and technology. Here are some ways in which manners have changed over time:  Formality: In the past, people were expected to be very formal and use specific titles and modes of address when speaking to others. Today, people are generally more casual in their interactions, and titles are often dropped in favor of first names.  Technology: With the advent of new technologies, such as smartphones and social media, manners have changed to reflect new forms of communication. For example, it is now considered rude to use your phone during a face-to-face conversation, while texting and messaging have become common ways of communicating.  Gender roles: Over time, gender roles and expectations have shifted, leading to changes in manners. For example, it is now considered acceptable for women to initiate conversations with men and to pay for dates.  Table manners: Table manners have also evolved over time. In the past, formal dinners involved multiple courses and elaborate etiquette rules. Today, meals are generally less formal, and manners are more relaxed.  Diversity and multiculturalism: With increased diversity and multiculturalism, manners have become more inclusive, with an emphasis on respecting and celebrating different cultures and traditions.  Overall, manners have changed significantly over time, reflecting changes in social norms, cultural values, and technology. While some customs and expectations have persisted, others have shifted to reflect the changing needs and expectations of society.        ",1

"Ok, I'm doing this stream of consciousness thing. MTV is on in the background, and I'm remembering when I went to see them in concert at Jamboree in Tinley Park ,IL. Everyone thinks I'm crazy because I came from IL all the way to Texas. I don't feel crazy though. I wanted a change and I really love it down here. I wonder what Taveau is doing right now. She isn't answering my e-mail. Ok, it's only been a day , I'm just being impatient. Anyway, I wonder why she doesn't go by Taveau. I like it a whole lot better than Melanie. And I seriously wonder if she's straight or not. I just want to come right out and ask her, but that's not really something you want to ask someone you just established contact with. I hate Hanson. They're such one hit wonders. And the one hit is called MMMMMBop. How incredibly stupid is that? They're like a younger , related New Kids. Speaking of New Kids, how about Spice Girls? There's another total lack of talent engineered for success. It's sad when losers like that are valued in our popular culture. What's a great idea? That commercial just said something was a great idea. I know what a great idea would be: if I would start to do my Calculus homework. Sometimes I wonder if I actually want to pass that class. I wonder what I could do to welcome Daniela-my roommate-back home after this weekend. God, she's so stuck on her boyfriend. I guess that 's pretty typical for our age group, but still. I don't know, I guess I just don't understand that level of dependence. Then again I moved from Joliet, IL to Austin, TX with exactly eight minutes of crying. I wonder if that makes me psycho or just morbid or something. Chris Rock is so funny. I love this commercial. Whoever had the idea of having Chris Rock in imitation videos for promos needs to get an award. God, I hope Jewel doesn't come on . That one song makes me so incredibly homesick for my friends. I do miss them , but I don't really miss my parents all that much . Daniela is always telling me how cold that is , but I can't help it, it's not intentional, it's just how I feel. Ok, Jewel did come on, but at least it was just YOU WERE MEANT FOR ME, OOPS I just hit the tab key and scrolled way down to the bottom. I'm so dumb with computers, I swear. I know so much less about them than all the people around me. I'm confident I'll learn, but I just wish we would've had that experience prior to college. Daniela's talking about that one snoopy girl in her Plan 2 group. She's really screwy. She doesn't even know if her computer is a PC or a Mac. I guess I'm one up on her. hey, how much longer am I supposed to write? only a couple more minutes. Oh well. Jamiroquai's on now. I saw him in concert too. Oh, that just made me a little sad. We all went to that concert about two weeks before we graduated, and we all sang FRESHMEN together, and , I don't know. I feel like I'm babbling, but I guess that's pretty much the whole point. I remember Dr. Pennebaker telling us not to worry, some one would eventually read these. Well, I don't really care if anyone reads this or not. I 'm not really saying much of anything. I don't even feel like I'm saying anything important. I wonder if I should have put on that survey thing that I was bisexual. Not only is that non-confidential, but they may not want me because I could upset the demographics of their study. Oh well, I'll let them deal with that. Time's up. I hope this was at least somewhat interesting to whoever got condemned to read this.",0
"I have been asked to do this psychology assignment of writing down my train of thoughts and feelings for twenty minutes with out stopping. So far that was my first train of thought  I know it's a boring intro sentence, but yet I'm not allowed to stop and think of how to write more eloquently. I guess that leads me to my next thought  school. This is my first semester at college and there is so much going on. When you asked to write down our stress factor on a scale of 17, I believe I might have marked an 8. There are so many things that are going on, and I want to be able to organize everything in time slots. The only thing is that they keep giving me stuff to do. I suppose you would define ""they"" as professors with homework and S. I meetings, which I really want to attend. Then I had my first sorority meeting last night, and they have so much in store for us this semester. I suppose I should tell you that I love going home  not to see my family (will, sort of that too  you got to love mom and dad!), but I have boyfriend back at Houston. I was planning on going home all these weekends, but it turns out that I have something I have to do that is mandatory on almost every weekend. This boyfriend of mine is totally worth the trouble and stress of going home. I have had the most amazing summer with him just hanging out and doing fun activities. He makes me feel ten times happier when I'm around him and it's just really hard not having him here to help me adjust into this new life style. I do however, talk to him everyday and write him letters. The first week I arrived in Austin, I can honestly say that it sucked because rush drained a lot out of me and then we had to start school with no breaks from rush week. I thought I would be able to adjust better in this big place, because I consider myself an easy going friendly person. There is just so much that is consuming my life right now that I hardly have time to stop and think about what I need to do. I love exercising and used to do it everyday, and now I haven't had time to do any of that this past week because of school. I just hate this time in my life right now when everything is so jumbled up in my brain. I can't wait for the day when I have everything organized and I don't feel too constrained to one aspect of my life. I also hate this time because you don't really know anybody. True, I've met people and they are all really nice, but I haven't gotten to that stage when you can say anything to them and not look stupid. I am really glad that I did join the sorority just so I can meet people, but there are 60 people that I can meet and that's just too much for me to build strong friendships all at once. I do have some friends from back home, but I hardly have time to visit with them because I'm so consumed with everything else. I just need to sit down and relax. I did go home for Labor Day to visit my boyfriend, and that was exactly what I needed  just to hang out with someone who knows you so well. We did basically nothing and it was great not having to worry about anything. That weekend I think was somewhat a turning point in my attitude of college. It just made me realize that it is harder than I thought (adjusting wise) but everything turns out okay in the end. Plus I was happy to know that I do have somebody who loves me just as much as I love him; and that when I'm missing him, he's thinking about me too. I guess it just made me feel not so lost in college knowing that I have a great person back home supporting me every step of the way. Okay, twenty minutes are up.",0
" The statement made by Samuel Johnson, ""Ignorance, when voluntary, is criminal,"" implies that people who choose to remain ignorant of important information or knowledge can be held accountable for their actions. In some cases, this may be true, as deliberate ignorance can lead to harmful or unethical decisions.  For example, a doctor who intentionally ignores new medical research and continues to use outdated practices that harm their patients could be considered criminally negligent. Similarly, a politician who refuses to educate themselves on important policy issues and makes uninformed decisions that negatively impact their constituents could be held accountable for their ignorance.  However, it's important to note that not all cases of ignorance can be considered criminal. Some people may not have access to certain information or may not have the resources to educate themselves. In such cases, it would be unfair to hold them responsible for their ignorance.  Moreover, ignorance is not always a voluntary choice. Many people are born into situations where they are deprived of education or exposed only to biased or incomplete information. In such cases, it would be unjust to consider their ignorance criminal.  In conclusion, while Samuel Johnson's statement may hold true in some cases, it's important to consider the context and circumstances surrounding the ignorance in question. Ultimately, it is important for individuals to make a conscious effort to educate themselves and remain informed, as ignorance can have far-reaching consequences.    ",1
"My day has been a really good day today. I meet up with my ex boyfriend and went out to lunch with him at the Central Market Cafe. Then we began to talk about the idea of seeing other people and we got in a relatively big argument. He accused me of seeing another guy and I told him the truth that I was seeing another guy. We talked to each other and told ourselves that we were going to try and fix and mend the relationship that we once had. It made me feel a lot better about myself because for the past couple of months I have been feeling very depressed and gloomy about myself. I wanted to talk to somebody and when Nick came around and wanted to talk to me for the first time in a long time about the problems that we were having it made me feel a lot better. Nick is my ex boyfriend, just to let you know. The when I got home I started thinking about how far behind I was on all of my school work and I began to stress out about all of the reading and studying that needed to be accomplished in such a short time frame. Then I was thinking about what my Health Promotion teacher told us about relaxing to alleviate stress and other worries that we are having with our lives right now. So I am just now beginning to calm down about my school work and the other stresses in my life right now and trying to pace myself so that I can stay ahead. So I am finally getting to this writing assignment that I had no idea about until last Monday. This just added to the stress that I was feeling about my life but now some of it is off my shoulders because I am doing this assignment. I am worried about my mom right now also because she just went through a divorce and now I am out of her life and not living with her so she really doesn't have anyone to talk to. She always sounds so miserable on the phone when I talk to her and she makes me feel bad for leaving home even when she wanted me to leave. My dad and my mother just recently got a divorce and it has torn all of our lives up but I think that it has torn my mother's life up the most. She had change jobs and start a new life over without my father and his harassing ways to hold her back from wanting the most from her life. She acts so depressed when I hear from her and in turn it makes me feel very depressed about my life too. I love my mother to death but I just wish that she would keep me out of her problems and go seek some help from someone who can actually help her. Anyways I think that school is going to turn out really good and I hope that I can keep up my grades and make it into the Nursing School. I am already into the Pre Nursing School but I have to test into the Nursing School in order to become a Registered Nurse. I am excited about fulfilling my life long dream about becoming a nurse and helping out people who are need of assistance and love. I want to work with children in a pediatric doctors office when I graduate. I really do not want to work in an emergency room with very sick people who come in there almost dead and there is no chance for us to save them. I want to help people out and I don't want to feel like I didn't help them out by letting a person die.",0

"  Reality shows have gained popularity in recent years, and there are now more shows in this genre than ever before. However, whether or not these shows make good television depends on several factors.  On the one hand, reality shows can be entertaining and engaging for viewers, as they offer a glimpse into the lives of ordinary people and their personal struggles and triumphs. These shows can also be educational, as they can help viewers learn about different cultures and lifestyles.  For example, the show ""Queer Eye"" on Netflix offers a positive and uplifting experience by featuring experts who provide makeovers to people who need a boost in their lives. This show helps viewers learn about different lifestyles and the challenges that people face while also promoting self-improvement and acceptance.  On the other hand, some reality shows can be overly dramatized and manipulative, which can detract from their entertainment value. These shows may rely on creating conflict and drama between the participants to increase viewership, rather than focusing on genuine human experiences.  For example, shows like ""Jersey Shore"" and ""Keeping Up With the Kardashians"" have been criticized for promoting negative and superficial values, and for contributing to the decline of culture and intellectual standards on television.  In conclusion, reality shows can make good television if they are well-produced and offer genuine insights into the human experience. However, if they rely on overly dramatized situations and promote negative values, they may not be good for society as a whole.    ",1
"However, after becoming sick I began to notice how much I was dependant on my mother to help me , and take me to the doctor and pick up any medicines I needed. Now I have to do it all on my own. I had to wake up in the middle of the night and take myself to the hospital, I had to pick up my medicine, I was now the one who signed the form for my treatment to occur, not my mother. Now it is all me, and in a way that kind of frightens me. I now have to wonder if I am doing things right, or if I am screwing things up. Also, I keep thinking about going home this weekend for the first time, and I am not quite sure if I feel ready to see some of the people I graduated with. I am really excited about seeing my parents and friends, but I am really dreading going to my former high school's football game. Then all of this brings up another thought into my mind. Everyone so going to make comments on the fact that I still don't have a boyfriend, or that I am too picky when it comes to guys, and all of that other mess. All of this seems so superficial when I look at it, but this is the stuff that I have been thinking about. I have met several guys that I am really interested in, but it seems like there is always a problem. I always seem to be able to pick things out about guys and turn a perfectly good guy into a loser. I can pretend that I like a guy to suppress my feelings for wanting to be with somebody, but I can't last more than two weeks with that person. I can try and try to make things work out but I always seem to push guys away, which my other believes is her fault because of her and my father's divorce or something like that. I just seem to get scared when a guy gets to close to me. All through high school, all of my friends dated the same guy, and I was the one who had a different guy in every dance picture. I am unable to totally figure out what my problem is , but I am hoping now that I am in college I will ""find myself. """,0
"This assignment is cool. It requires no outside tinking. I can just think about what I want to think about. Man I've got a three hour drive ahead of me today and i made the same drive yesterday. It was soooo boring. I wish i could just warp back to Austin or something like that. But i like being back in Pearland. It's great to see my family and friends again. I miss them sometimes and the once or twice a month i get to see them are well worth it. But when my trip is over, I'm always eager to see my peeps in Austin again and just to get back to normal life. I've got a lot of reading to do this weekend and i don't want to do it. It's alll textbook reading and i would much rather be reading Dean Koontz or just not be reading at all. I wish i could type faster and that way i could type a lot. I've got to type as much as possible. Otherwise i won't be satisfied with my experiment. blankness. . i want some new CD's to listen to on the way back to Austin. that way i wouldn't get a sbored as i was yesterday. and then the ride would weem much shorter. wow i still got thirteen minutes left. i wish i could slept in longer today but i had to wake up to make sure that i would finish this in time. i don't mind doing it but i'm jsut so dang lazy that this is even annnoying to me. I'm just not good at doing things that i don't want to do. oh well. i talked to Nick last night and we talked about how things are diff. now because i moved to Austin. all he does now is go out with girls since andy is going to San Antonio and i'm already in Austin. things have changed since i moved. i can't just go over to his house anytime i'm bored anymore  it's a three hour drive if i do. i miss those guys and my family more than i thought i would  it's weird being back at home. the place seems different. my room seems foreign to me because my parents cleaned it up and moved things around the week after i left for austin. i hope i'm not getting carpal tunnel syndrome, my wrists are getting kind of sore and my arms are already sore from playing racuetball the other day. it was fun thought and i'm probly going to play again today or tomorrow. i'm looking forward to it. ahhh no more wrist pain. i hope my brother won't get mad at me for stealing his computer chair but it makes my wrists feel so much better. WOW my phones loud it just scared the crap out of me when it rang see there it is!  typing is sooo much easier whne your in a  computer chair and not a dining room chair. i wonder what you'll think when your reading this or if anyone's even going to read it. hmmmmmmm.  i need to leave pretty soon so i don't hit Houston's rush hour but there is so much stuff i need to get done with here. wow the opportunity cost sucks. three more minutes. i only got a few more minutes and then no more of this mind to page thing. after that i can just think and not have to type it up or anything ike that. i hope Pearland wins tonight and moves up in Houston's rankings and AP state rankings. they are relaly good and deserve to be high up in all rankings. likewise i hope UT kicks NC's butt tomorrow because UT IS all that and a huge bag of potato chips. then maybe they could move ahead of OU in the AP rankings because everyone knows we're better than those north of the red river weirdos  who cares about the sooners anyway. Hybl sucks and their second and third strigers are both freshmen and that's really going to hurt em bad. oh well we'll see on October 12th. GO HORNS!!!",0

"I came back to my home town for Labor Day. I didn't really want to, but my friend talked me into coming with her. I've only been gone a week and I'm already back. Why? I'm not home sick. I guess I just didn't want to stay in Austin when everyone I knew was leaving. I hope Ajay made it to the airport. I'm really worried about him right now. I pray for his mom to get better but I just don't know. I want to promise him everything is going to be alright but I just can't. I wish he would stop drinking to make the pain go away but I guess if it makes him feel better right now. Who am I to tell him what to do anyway? I wonder what time Michael's game is tomorrow. My mom told me but I forgot. Maybe I should have gone to Dallas this weekend. I don't know? I think anything's better that being in Odessa. Football is such a big thing here. Of course the first thing we do is go to Jeesong's football game as soon as we got here. I'm glad Ajay doesn't do anything as dangerous as that I already worry about him enough. I really think we are maturing in our relationship, learning to work through problems that most couples don't ever have in their entire lives. I don't know what he's going to do if he loses her too. I know she wants to be with his dad but isn't it selfish to leave your children. Catherine just came in here to ask me what time I was going to get up. I said 10 but that wasn't early enough so we decided on 9:30. I am very happy with my schedule because I don't have a class before 9:30 and I like all of them. One thing about school I hate is that I'm always so tired. Why can't I check my stupid email from my house? You would think a major computer system at a major university would have some way you could check it without having to download this and that. You should be able to enter your IF or UTEID and open a link site, but no. Nothing is that easy. I hate computers and if I never had to use one I wouldn't mind a bit, but if I didn't know how I couldn't pass any of my classes. That is another thing. Why is everything I need for a class on the internet? I feel sorry for people who have no clue how to use it. I thought Kris was never going to hook up her computer but she finally discovered she had no choice. Computers are our lives these days. What would the human race do without them? It's scary you know, our whole life is on this thing and if they know what their doing, anyone could find some thing you don't want them to have.",0
"so far this freshmen year has been a intereasting adventure if you like S&M. I came down a month early to go with my friends to go to all these fraternity parties and meet a few musicians and audio engineers I have had correspondence with since I recorded my CD. The fraternity parties weren't that great except for a Kappa Sigma one that was pretty wild. I pledged for two days before it hit me that this was a waste of time. Not that waiting in endless lines (with endless hassles) to shell out more money to this fine universtity isn't making me age before my years. I am getting use to the regamorand of rude cafeteria & accounting people and trecking to classes in BFE. I can't say it's all been bad though I did get a free T-shirt and a lot of nefty junk people shove into your hands as you try to walk by. Oh, and then there are the roads with the none existent left turns, constant construction, 30-min limit parking (when you can find it), and cops that stop you for the fun of it. I don't know if its been- oh it gives you more space well then I can continue to ramble. College is supposed to be the best years some say. I think I should of keep better stock in my highschool years. Now except for parties I live like a reclouse in my apartment doing homework for a foriegn language I don't want to learn and trying to write more music while the people above me sound like there having basketball pratice up there. I'm sure it has been atleast twenty minutes by now and if you 've read this far then you're probably ready to quit reading by now. So I'll let you off till I have to write the next one.",0
" Teaching is a noble and challenging profession that requires constant learning and improvement. Teachers have a significant impact on their students’ lives and academic success, so they need to use effective methods and strategies to facilitate learning and engagement. In this essay, I will describe some of the techniques or methods that could help teachers do their job more effectively.  One of the techniques that teachers can use is online learning. Online learning is the process of educating others using the internet, whether that’s through video calls, webinars, or messaging platforms1. Online learning can be beneficial for both teachers and students, as it offers flexibility, accessibility, and variety. Teachers can create digital resources for their students, such as presentations, videos, or worksheets, and use different tools and platforms to deliver them. Students can access these resources at their own pace and convenience, and interact with their teachers and peers through online forums or chats. Online learning can also help teachers reach more students who may not be able to attend school due to various reasons1.  Another technique that teachers can use is experiential learning. Experiential learning is the idea that learning is a product of direct experience rather than passive observation2. Experiential learning can help students develop critical thinking, problem-solving, and creativity skills, as well as learn from their mistakes and reflect on their actions2. Teachers can use experiential learning methods such as experiments, simulations, games, field trips, or projects to engage students in active learning and connect theory to practice. Experiential learning can be effective for several subjects, especially during science experiments, sports coaching, and group projects1.  A third technique that teachers can use is gamification. Gamification is the application of game elements and principles to non-game contexts, such as education3. Gamification can help teachers make learning more fun and motivating for students by using rewards, challenges, feedback, and competition. Teachers can use gamification techniques such as quizzes, badges, leaderboards, or points to enhance student participation and retention. Gamification can also help teachers differentiate instruction and assessment according to the needs and preferences of different students3.  In conclusion, teaching is a complex and dynamic process that requires effective methods and techniques to achieve optimal results. Some of the techniques that teachers can use are online learning, experiential learning, and gamification. These techniques can help teachers create engaging and meaningful learning experiences for their students and support their academic achievements.   ",1
" Advocates of this idea argue that it would allow parents to ensure their children's health, intelligence, and physical attractiveness. They believe that if we have the technology to select for specific traits, then why not use it to help children avoid genetic diseases or disabilities and enhance their cognitive abilities?  However, this kind of genetic engineering raises many ethical concerns. One of the most significant concerns is that it could lead to social inequality and discrimination based on the characteristics that parents choose for their children. For example, if wealthy parents can afford to design their children to be smarter, taller, and more attractive, it could widen the gap between the rich and the poor. This could also lead to discrimination against people who are not genetically engineered, creating a new form of societal hierarchy based on genetics.  Furthermore, it raises the question of who has the right to decide what traits are desirable and what traits are not. The idea of designing children can quickly spiral into eugenics, where some groups of people are considered inferior and unworthy of existence. This is a morally dangerous path that could lead to the dehumanization of certain groups.  Finally, there is the question of whether this kind of genetic engineering is necessary. While it may be desirable to eliminate genetic diseases or disabilities, there is no clear consensus on what makes a person intelligent, beautiful, or athletic. Many of these traits are subjective and can vary based on cultural norms and personal preferences. In essence, we could end up creating a homogenized society where everyone looks and thinks alike, eliminating diversity and creativity.  In conclusion, while the idea of designing children with specific physical and personality traits may seem attractive, it raises many ethical and societal concerns. It is essential to approach this issue with caution and carefully consider the long-term implications of this technology.                     ",1
" The statement by Bob Dylan about success reflects a subjective viewpoint that can be interpreted in various ways.  On one hand, Dylan's definition of success may be valid for individuals who prioritize personal fulfillment over material wealth or external recognition. For such people, the ability to pursue their passions and hobbies while maintaining a healthy work-life balance could indeed constitute a sense of achievement.  On the other hand, for some people, success may involve striving towards a particular goal, such as professional success or financial stability. In this case, the statement might not fully capture what success means to them. These individuals might define success as achieving their ambitions, attaining a particular level of wealth or status, or contributing to society in some way.  Ultimately, the concept of success is highly subjective and varies depending on a person's values, beliefs, and life experiences. It is up to each individual to determine what success means to them and how they wish to pursue it. Some people may find that Dylan's definition of success resonates with them, while others may not.          ",1
"  From a societal point of view, paternity leave policies can have several advantages. Firstly, they promote gender equality by recognizing the importance of fathers' role in raising children. Secondly, they allow fathers to bond with their newborns, which can strengthen the parent-child relationship and benefit the child's emotional and cognitive development. Additionally, paternity leave can also reduce the burden on mothers who may otherwise have to take care of the newborn on their own.  On the other hand, some people argue that paternity leave policies could have negative consequences for employers. For example, they could increase the cost of labor or decrease productivity if a critical employee is absent. Moreover, some argue that paternity leave policies could lead to discrimination against men, particularly if they are seen as less committed to their careers.  Overall, it's important to weigh the potential benefits and drawbacks of paternity leave policies and consider the long-term impact they may have on society, families, and businesses.         ",1
"I am sitting in my room. There is tile being laid in the bathroom next to me. The sound of musics floats in from the next room. Paint smells intoxicate me. I feel slightly light headed as I have for the past several days in my apartment. The sound of the modem next to the computer begins to hum as if it is heating up. My mama walks in the room and looks annoyed as the desk she trying to put together is not working according to her plan. I wonder whey she looks so upset about it. The air conditioner begins to run. I have a book for my government class lying open on the floor. Who would have known that there would be that much reading for one class. I cannot tell if I want to finish reading it or try and take notes from class for it to make sense. The phone rings next to me. I don't pick it up because I am worried I have waited too long to finish this assignment and I won't get full credit. I fell asleep reading earlier this afternoon and just woke up. Funny how the time just slips away like that. You are payiong attention to everything around you one minute and the next it is gone. You wake up and can't remember when you fell asleep the time before right now. My nose starts to itch which is funny,because it isn't even dusty in my apartment right now. The green wall of my bedroom is making the setting sunlight a strange color on my feet. They look a weird yellow color as if they are becoming infected with something. It makes my sheets look pretty though. The mixture of green, yellow, and purple reminds me of a rainbow. Everything is starting to fade. My mind and eyes start to slow down. Everyone around me is moving too fast for my taste. I want it to slow down. Everything should be slower these days. I like it when it is lazy like on Sundays. I watch TV until I feel like eating something. I can smell my mama start to cook dinner. She always makes such good food for me. I smell cheese melting on something. I think it might be broccoli. But you can't smell brocolli. I keep spelling that differently. I wonder how it is supposed to be spelled. How funny. Things like that when they happen. LIke when you can't remember how to spell and or something easy like that. I realized I haven't typed for the whole 20 minutes right now, but I have to have it in by five. I think I will try to do it again in a minute. I hope this isn't too bad.",0

" Obesity is a complex and multifaceted problem that affects millions of people around the world. It is defined as having an excessive amount of body fat that poses a risk to health. Obesity can lead to both personal and societal problems, such as:  Personal problems: People with obesity are more likely to develop a number of potentially serious health problems, including: heart disease and strokes, type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, certain cancers, osteoarthritis, sleep apnea, gallstones, fatty liver disease, kidney disease, pregnancy complications, and mental health issues such as depression and low self-esteem12. Obesity can also affect the quality of life and well-being of individuals by limiting their mobility, social interactions, and opportunities for education and employment. Obesity can also increase the risk of discrimination, stigma, and bullying2. Societal problems: Obesity can have a significant impact on the society as a whole by increasing the burden on the health care system, the economy, and the environment. Obesity can increase the costs of health care services and medications due to the increased prevalence and severity of obesity-related diseases1. Obesity can also reduce the productivity and income of individuals and businesses due to absenteeism, presenteeism (working while sick), disability, and premature mortality2. Obesity can also contribute to environmental degradation by increasing the demand for food, energy, water, and land resources2. Therefore, obesity is not just a personal issue but a public health challenge that requires collective action and responsibility. A comprehensive approach that addresses the root causes and consequences of obesity is needed to prevent and manage this problem effectively. Such an approach should include strategies that promote healthy eating habits, physical activity, behavioral change, environmental modification, policy intervention, education and awareness, and medical treatment12. By working together, we can create a healthier and more sustainable future for ourselves and our society.      ",1
" On one hand, bullying is a pervasive problem that can have serious consequences for both the victim and the perpetrator. It can lead to physical and emotional harm, as well as lasting psychological trauma. Additionally, bullying can negatively impact academic performance and overall well-being, creating an unsafe and hostile learning environment for students. In this sense, it is reasonable to argue that schools have a responsibility to address bullying, as they have a duty to ensure the safety and well-being of their students.  On the other hand, some may argue that bullying is primarily a parental responsibility, and that schools should not be tasked with addressing this issue. Parents are often in the best position to recognize the warning signs of bullying behavior and to intervene early on. Furthermore, schools may not have the resources or expertise to adequately address complex social and emotional issues such as bullying. In this sense, it may be argued that schools should focus on providing academic instruction, leaving social and emotional development to parents.  Ultimately, whether schools should address bullying or leave it to parents depends on various factors, such as the severity of the bullying, the resources available to the school, and the role of parents in preventing and addressing bullying behavior. However, it is generally recognized that bullying is a serious issue that requires a collaborative effort between schools, parents, and communities to effectively prevent and address.

" Fame and fortune are often seen as desirable goals in our society, but they can also have significant impacts on a person’s life. Some of these impacts may be positive, such as recognition, wealth, influence, and opportunities. However, some of them may be negative, such as isolation, mistrust, loss of privacy, stress, addiction, and identity crisis.  According to some psychological studies12, fame can change a person’s sense of self and their relationship with the world. Some celebrities may develop a split between their “authentic self” and their “celebrity self”, as a way of coping with the demands and expectations of fame. They may also feel like they are living in a bubble, a cage, or a fishbowl, where they are constantly watched, judged, and invaded by others. They may lose touch with their roots, their values, and their true friends. They may also become addicted to fame itself, as a way of filling a void or escaping from their problems.  Fame can also affect a person’s fortune, both positively and negatively. On one hand, fame can bring financial rewards, material comforts, and access to resources and privileges. On the other hand, fame can also bring financial risks, such as overspending, lawsuits, taxes, and frauds. Fame can also make a person more vulnerable to exploitation, manipulation, and betrayal by others who want to profit from their fame or harm their reputation.  Therefore, fame and fortune can change a person’s life in many ways, both good and bad. The way a person deals with these changes depends on their personality, their values, their support system, and their coping skills. Some celebrities may be able to handle fame and fortune with grace, humility, and responsibility. Others may struggle with fame and fortune and succumb to its negative effects. Fame and fortune are not inherently good or bad; they are what we make of them. ",1

"Hello looks like a journal entry. Frustrating blank page as usual, not nearly as much  pressure as a true journal might be. No, true journals (at least the ones I know) come complete  with the most irrational, egotistical, subjective criticisms at all. Here, I might simply start to list  adjectives. Think I will. Chair, run, cake, spoon, sparrow, harly, make, spy, insult, laughter,  organization, economy, ----- complete crap!!! Ha! Adjectives are fun. What to make of this  phenomenal opportunity?  Don't be shy, be compliant. Or just spew forth venom, anecdotes,  general life lessons. Inclination says talk about ""me"". Here's what that is. Or so we'll try. Music, menus, frustration. Solitary, isolated, friendship social butterfly. Making waves the size  of anthills, feeling pretty depressed about it. The color of the water is green. Count the levels  of meaning there. Anaphor. Hyperbole. Homonyms. Czech Republic. Czeska Republica. The  United States of my Ass. Could I say here that I want to ______ the president?  Protect Identity. The blank might have been filled with ""make love"" or ""marry"" or ""help through important  issues"". Certainly not ""castrate. ""  What else?  Looking forward to making A's lots of A's, because  after all purpose belongs to those classes in which one might be rewarded for hard work and  ass kissing. Discombobulated this page may be, but organization's overrated. I know a quote:  one advantage of being disorganized is that one is constantly making new discoveries. ""  That  one's right above Dad's desk at the office. Why do I experience comfort in an environment less  than rational? or organized?  Possibly the same reason I love psychoactive mindbenders (by this,  of course, I refer to puzzles and games like scrabble!) Because true beauty in life exposes itself  not in the routine, as religious dogma might promise, but at an Indian buffet at which one can  stand before a plethora of unfamiliar treasures, waiting for the unfamiliar perspective of a  Western mind for validation. what else?  I think this weekend I'm going to stimulate myself with  something organic - or possibly inorganic - and clean up the house. Make normal people  sense of the place so that when Mom and Dad show up tomorrow they don't swallow their  tongues. Music makes everything voluptuous, adds another layer to experiences so that they  find their way to memory lane more frequently and effectively. Takeover from an armchair. Natural delicacies. TV numbs, music accentuates, pleasure reading enriches, highest level math  and science is God. School puts the kind of pressure on people that creates Ted Bundies. UT is  anything but a good school, just like college immidiately following high school is anything but a  good idea. Just going doesn't plant seeds of positivity or success. I was the fool, caught in the  wave of college matriculation, and still to this day I feel I need four more years. Just like that  fucking idiot GW Bush. Right now, and not because I endorse the use of any of the following  terms, I'm going to type into this mind drain a slew of derrogatory or defamatory terms that I  rarely use but that for some reason are to come out when I open the floodgates. It's because I  wanted to call Bush a faggot, or a fucking idiot, or a fucking shithead hyppocrite, but some  mechanism that pisses on creativity and ultimate truth caught me in the act and slapped my red  hand before any other utterance could follow. Well, here, you fuck, stop this!!!!  Oh, I was going  to go into some racial slurs, but that's just so stupid. How about cracker-ass whitebread honky  guerro americano puto!  that would be perfect for me. Still, something about WASPy racial slurs  isn't nearly as intimidating as ""nigger"" or ""spic"" or daggerhead, or whatever. This world exists  as a cesspool of religious dogma, hate, and a need to evolve. It's going to suck till that evolution  takes place, but God Damn it, I'll wallow in the shit till I die and I'll like it. Couldn't qualify, for  that reason, as the typical ""good people"" one might imagine a large percentage of those floating  around Earth for some god or cause might hope. That's what makes music --- done. Thanks  for the toilet!",0
" On one hand, living in the country can offer a quieter and more peaceful lifestyle. Away from the hustle and bustle of the city, one can enjoy a closer connection with nature and a slower pace of life. The fresh air and open space of rural areas can also promote better physical health and well-being. In addition, housing tends to be more affordable in the country, and there may be more opportunities for outdoor activities like hiking and gardening.  On the other hand, living in the city can offer many advantages. Cities are often centers of commerce, culture, and entertainment, providing a wealth of job opportunities and amenities like restaurants, theaters, and museums. Public transportation systems make it easy to get around without owning a car. Additionally, living in a diverse urban environment can expose individuals to a variety of people and cultures, leading to personal growth and development.  Ultimately, the choice between living in the country or the city depends on personal preferences, lifestyle, and priorities. Some individuals may thrive in the energy and excitement of the city, while others may prefer the peace and solitude of the countryside. It is important to carefully consider these factors and choose a living environment that aligns with one's values and goals.      ",1
"As I sit in my dorm room at this point in my life, I can think of one thing only, sadness. Sadness because I miss my family and my boyfriend and because I feel extremely lonely at this huge school. I am overwhelmed with my thoughts and concerns. I am scared about meeting new people, scared about making good grades, and in general I'm scared about starting all over again. I know that I should be so excited that I get this opportunity to begin my life again and start new adventures, but I'm not. Last summer, for the first time in my life, I felt like I belonged and I was extremely happy. Of course as soon as I obtained that wonderful feeling, it is ripped away from me at an instant. I feel like I am so stressed out here because I have so much to do at all hours of the day. I'm a very high strung person and need to relax a lot and I'm not really given that opportunity here. Joining a sorority was something I thought I had to do when I got here. So I did and I'm not sure it was the right decision for me. I think snobbery overwhelms my sorority and that bothers me a great deal. I really don't know exactly what my problem is but I just don't feel comfortable here. I am in love for the first time and the guy I love is in Fort Worth. We are not dating because we both agree it would be too hard but I love him so much that words could not possibly describe. It hurts to be in love and know that I will probably never be with him because of our location. I want to transfer but I I would be terrified to do that just for a guy. But when I think about it, I would do that for him. My thoughts are in a jumble right now and I feel many emotions running through my body. I'm not quite sure what I am going to do at this point in my life. My confusion, anger, and stress take over my life and it will take some time to figure out who I am and what I want with my life.",0
"College is so cool. I really can't remember the last time I felt so many emotions at the same time. I've already met so many incredible and different people I can't even begin to describe all of them. I am definately having mixed thoughts about having a boyfriend at this moment because of all the new people I have met and would definately like to meet, get to know, and date. My boyfriend is totally mad because he is so jealous. I hate jealous people I wish everyone would just, I don't know go along with it. I ate the grosests food in jester cafeteria today and had the weirdest conversation with two very interesting and cool guys that I have already met from camptexas. That was like almost the most fun I've had in a really long time I'm so glad I decided to go and wasn't to scared. I was so scared about coming to UT  because it is so big and I just didn't know if I could adjust after going to such a small catholic school. I'm so glad to be away from old people and meeting knew ones. High school was such an almost horrible experience, I hope college is so much better. So I'm in this room with these two guys, one who I met at camptexas and he looks exactly like the guy from rookie of the year he doesn't know it but I have this incredible, horrible, obssesion with him. He is just the hottest guy I have ever seen. So I met this really cool guy from tarytown in New York which is like the place I've been obssessed with since forever. He is a guy I would really like to hang out with. This other guy who is rookie of the years roomate is totally obssessed with Britany Spears I really can't stand her but I think it is just because I am so jealous that he likes her more than me. And Drew has almost naked women pictures all over his wall that makes me very jealous and I was just thinking about jealous people. The music is blasting in my ear I don't know who it is. Drew complains a lot about college ruled spirals and needing more space. I really hate that my roomate and myself don't have much in common. Everyone else seems to be like best friends with their roomates I need a really good girl friend to hang out with. Or maybe I'm just ment to have guy friends. I guess it would be okay with me I get along with  them better. I think classes are going to be really fun and not too hard. Which is really a relief because I though it would be really hard. I've seen so many interesting people. I miss my parents like crazy and my dogs and sisters. I would never trade this experience for going to UTEP that would really suck. I really miss my friend Bianca and Anne. I think for labor day we are going to San Antonio if Anne and Lianna and Vero come up. I was thinking about Noodles the other day I wonder how she is. This is got to be one of the funnest assigments I have ever done. I really think I might double major whith something in Psychology because the human mind is an incredible thing. Well my 20 minutes seem to be up that kind of sucks I guess I could really write forever I need to go write my parents and some friends e-mails and then read a little for Biology and probably go to sleep I'm really tired.",0
" The discovery of a formula that would enable us to live forever is a fascinating idea that raises complex ethical, moral, and philosophical questions. While some may consider it a blessing, others might view it as a curse. In my opinion, the answer to whether it would be a blessing or a curse depends on various factors, including the availability of resources, the meaning of life, and the quality of life in general.  On one hand, living forever could be seen as a blessing. One significant advantage of immortality is that it allows us to pursue our passions and accomplish all of our goals without the pressure of time. People would have unlimited time to explore new cultures, learn new skills, and engage in creative endeavors. Moreover, they would have the opportunity to see the world evolve, from societal and technological advancements to the discovery of new planets.  However, living forever could also be seen as a curse. One possible issue is that overpopulation would become a significant problem, given that people would no longer die. Resources such as food, water, and housing would become increasingly scarce, and the quality of life for everyone would decrease. Furthermore, people might experience boredom, loneliness, and a sense of meaninglessness due to the monotony of living forever.  Additionally, living forever may challenge the meaning of life. Many people find meaning in life through their mortality, as it drives them to seek purpose and fulfillment. If people no longer have a limited lifespan, they may struggle to find a sense of purpose, leading to a lack of motivation and drive.  In conclusion, whether living forever would be a blessing or a curse is a complex issue. While it offers some advantages, such as the ability to achieve all of one's dreams and goals, it could also lead to overpopulation and a decline in quality of life. Furthermore, it may challenge the meaning of life itself, and raise new ethical and philosophical questions. Ultimately, the decision to pursue immortality would require careful consideration and a thoughtful evaluation of its potential consequences.                   ",1
" Weather conditions such as heavy rain, snow, fog, or ice can significantly impact the time and effort required to travel to school. Poor visibility and slick road conditions can make it more challenging to drive, increasing the risk of accidents and delays. Walking or biking to school may also be more difficult or even dangerous in inclement weather.  Extreme temperatures can also affect a commute. In hot weather, high humidity and direct sunlight can make it uncomfortable to travel, while cold weather can lead to slippery roads or sidewalks and longer warm-up times for vehicles. Additionally, public transportation may experience delays due to weather-related issues, such as flooding or fallen trees blocking tracks.  Overall, weather conditions can have a significant impact on the ease and safety of a commute to school, and it's important to plan accordingly and allow for extra time in case of delays or unexpected issues.

" Dear School Officials,  I am writing this letter to express my concern and disappointment regarding the recent decision to disband the club to which I belong. As a student who has been actively involved in this organization for some time now, I strongly urge you to reconsider this decision.  The club in question has been an integral part of our school's community for many years. It has provided a platform for students to come together, share their interests, and develop new skills. More importantly, it has served as a safe space for students who feel marginalized or left out of mainstream activities.  I understand that the decision to disband the club may have been made due to financial or logistical reasons. However, I believe that the benefits of keeping the club far outweigh any challenges that it may pose. By disbanding this club, you are taking away a vital resource for students who need it the most. You are also depriving the school of a vibrant community that has contributed positively to our campus culture.  Furthermore, the club has been successful in achieving its goals and has made significant contributions to our school. For example, the club has organized several events that have raised awareness about important social issues and have even raised funds for various charitable causes. The club has also been responsible for initiating several projects that have had a positive impact on the school community.  In conclusion, I urge you to reconsider the decision to disband the club. The benefits of keeping the club far outweigh any challenges that it may pose. By disbanding the club, you are depriving students of a vital resource and taking away a vibrant community that has contributed positively to our campus culture. I believe that with some effort and support, the club can continue to thrive and make a positive impact on our school community.  Thank you for your attention to this matter.             ",1

I hate austin it sucks. i wish I was home - me and stephen are confused as to wut defines our relationship- we have strong feelings for each other. romantic one. but we don't seem to think a long distance relationship is ideal. plus we're not committing peoople. i'm awfully tired of this assignment and only 7 minutes have passed by. my neck hurts. i'm usually a tying sorta person. and I guess this is good practice for me- I use the back space key a lot - I wish I could type as well as my roomate jenny lau. she's an excellent typist. i'm just a scrub typer- I have bad coordination- I cna't dance- can't sing - can't 'type- can't play video games. sigh. i'm a good studier though. i don't' mind takin time to do things throughly-- I'm slow at pretty much everything I do but I do them sorta well. i wish stephen would hurry up and get on. he doestn' have his computer because it's at home but I'm sure there are plenty of resources at Rice university. i wish I went to rice. he told me about wut they did up there and it sounds so fun I wish I could get in and I wish I could afford it!then I would sooooo want to go! I think if I do ok this year I could prolly get in. but I don't know abou the other part - I'm gong to ut on scholarship money and I thinki t's going to run out before the 4 years are over. i wish money wasnt' such a big issue in my life. i'm unemployed right now and I have no cash flow but out. it sucks. i think next semester I'll start a work study thing. i wish my parents were architects adn hemotoligists liek stephen's parent's - they're on their way to becoming millionaires. i wish this was in store for my parents. they make lousy money and htey have 4 kids and 3 of whom are in college. my brother is at the university of houston right now and so is my sister. and my best friend. ltos of ppl from school go there. my home town houston. i like it there better than here. i'm sleepy. 13 minutes have gone by . man. where are u stephen? I slept with his tshirt on my bear last nite. i think about him often. i don't think I want to start a romantic relationship with him because I don't think it's worth the risk. i'm an idealist and a romantic and I doubt my best friend could fulfill my romantic desires as a boyfriend. he's a passive person who lets other people control. however he's always in control in his mind. he's so smart and so quiet. he keeps all his thoughts to himself unless u pry at him. he'll open up to me more than his life long best friend brian. i think it's because I'm a gurl and I'm always nosy. so I don't know. i doubt we're right for each other but u never knwo these things we could end up married. highly unlikely but possible. stephen said that he'll save up his money and take me to hawaii- I know that sounds so stupid and so unlikely but I believe it he does get a job soon. a high paying one- like at a computer place like this summer. he can do it - and if he does save up enough money- he really will take me. we've discussed it and he said he'd really try and I believe him. i guess it sounds like I'm trying to convience myself. maybe I am. but I really want to go and I belive that he could make this happen for the both  of us. he believes in having fun and living life so spring break we're there! I hope! hehehe. ok. 2 more minutes and I cna quit. after this I guess I'll write my lil estebie an email - this would be his second day of class at rice. he loves it there. he' an owl all the way. well ok times basically up bye bye bye bye!!!!",0
" Dear Town Officials,  As a resident of this town for many years, I have seen the community evolve and grow. While there have been many positive changes, there is one area that I believe could use improvement. The issue I would like to address is the lack of access to public parks and green spaces in our neighborhood.  Studies have shown that access to public parks and green spaces can have a positive impact on the physical and mental health of residents. Green spaces can serve as a place for exercise, relaxation, and socialization. They also provide a space for children to play and explore nature.  Unfortunately, in our neighborhood, there are few public parks or green spaces. This is a problem that can be easily remedied with the creation of a new park or the improvement of an existing one.  A new park would not only benefit residents, but it would also attract visitors to our town. Parks and green spaces are often a selling point for families looking to move to a new area. By investing in a new park or improving an existing one, we could increase property values and stimulate economic growth in the community.  Additionally, a new park could provide opportunities for community engagement and volunteering. Residents could come together to maintain the park, organize events, and create a sense of community.  There are many options for creating a new park or improving an existing one. The town could convert an unused lot into a park or add amenities such as walking trails, playgrounds, and picnic areas to an existing park.  Investing in a new park or improving an existing one would be a wise decision for the town. The benefits to residents, visitors, and the local economy are clear. I urge the town officials to seriously consider this proposal and take action to improve our neighborhood.  Thank you for your attention to this matter.   ",1
"When asked to write about my subconcious it just blocked everything that was in my mind. Let me see. well today I went to this Sigma Phi Omega Rush event and that has been in my mind ever since. Everyone there was so nice, everyone was smiling and introducing themselves and it makes me wonder is that how they really are? Or are they just doing that to get us to like their organization so they can take our money? Maybe I'm being paranoid, but those people were just really very very friendly that it felt like some horror flick full og nice smiling faces and they wait for the right moment to attack. During this event they had us fill out a questionare kind of like an application. One of the question was ""What quality do you have to contribute to the organization?""  The thing was I couldn't think of anything to say. I mean I am not a talented singer or anything or a pianist. I am just me. Isn't that enough? Then later on they interviewes us and they taped us! How embarrasing! They asked questions that will catch you by surprise! Like ""What song best describes you?"" I was like ummmmmmmmmmm OH OH the first thing that popped in my mind was Butterfly by Mariah Carey. I just made up some bogus answer that it symbolizes freedom and independency. honestly though I had no idea at the time what Butterfly was about or was talking about. I wonder if they know!? Oh well. I've been debating with my friends if I should join or not because it seems like a great experience meeting new people and all. The only thing that I am worried about is will they accept me for who I am or do I have to be the typical sorority chic? and I forgot to mention. Pledging is the big secret it is supposed to last 8 weeks! and no one can mention what exactly goes on during this 8 weeks!  DO we have to clean toilets or what? Maybe that is why they keep it a secret because once all the Rushees know about it they will think again before they join. Makes me wonder what pledging is all about. A lot of people think that joining a sorority is a good idea especially for social reasons. I would describe myself as friendly and sometimes outgoing, but I can be pretty shy with strangers. is that weird? It's just that some people I meet is just that I have no idea what to talk about, it is as if I freeze and don't know what to say. It is also kind of embarrasing because you look like a total fool if you don't know what to say or do especially with someone who doesn't know you very well. I think the reason why I sometimes feel that way, is that I feel intimidated and I feel really awkward. Like I do right now because I feel like I am runing out of things to say. Actually to think about it sororities do take up much time. Just to go to Rush events I have spent approximately 8 hours already and I haven't even been in it yet. It was for two organizations. Tomorrow is the party and I am not really looking forward to it because deep down inside I want to stay in my dorm and study instead of going to the Club. Lately I have been lazy and haven't been doing much but I promise myself that I will study and get the grades my parents deserve to see after all they've done for me. And if they ever find out I went to these meetings instead of study they won't be so proud. But I think one of the reasons that parents don't understand these tings, is because all they want me to do is study. I guess going and Rushing for these sororities is kind of my way to rebel. I know it sounds weird, but that is how I feel.",0
"  To prepare for a college admissions test, you should start by researching the test and its format. Find out what topics the test covers, how long it is, and what types of questions you can expect. Many college admissions tests, such as the SAT or ACT, also have practice tests available that you can take to get a sense of the format and types of questions.  Once you have an understanding of the test, develop a study plan that incorporates both reviewing the material covered on the test and practicing test-taking strategies. Some effective study strategies might include:  Creating a study schedule that allows you to review material over a longer period of time, rather than cramming at the last minute. Using flashcards to memorize important concepts and formulas. Practicing timed tests to improve your pacing and reduce test anxiety. Reviewing your mistakes and understanding why you got them wrong. Seeking out resources like textbooks, online videos, or tutoring services to fill gaps in your understanding of the material. It's also important to take care of your physical and mental health during your studying period. Make sure to get enough sleep, eat healthy foods, and exercise regularly. Additionally, practice stress-reducing techniques, like deep breathing or meditation, to help you stay calm and focused on test day.  Finally, remember that a college admissions test is just one part of the admissions process. Admissions committees will also consider other factors like your grades, extracurricular activities, and essays, so don't put all your eggs in one basket. Focus on doing your best on the test, but also remember to keep a balanced perspective on the college admissions process as a whole.    ",1
" Advocates for a complete ban on smoking in restaurants and bars argue that it is necessary to protect the health of workers and customers. Secondhand smoke is a known carcinogen and can cause lung cancer, heart disease, and other serious health problems. The separate smoking and non-smoking sections in restaurants are not effective in protecting people from secondhand smoke because the smoke can easily travel through the air conditioning system or other openings.  In addition to health concerns, some argue that a complete smoking ban would improve the overall atmosphere of restaurants and bars. Smoke can be unpleasant for non-smokers, and the smell can linger long after smokers have left. A smoke-free environment would be more pleasant for everyone and could attract more customers.  On the other hand, opponents of a complete smoking ban argue that it would infringe on the rights of smokers. They argue that smoking is a personal choice and that smokers should be allowed to smoke in designated areas. Some also argue that a complete smoking ban would hurt businesses that rely on smokers as customers.  In conclusion, the debate over whether to ban smoking in all restaurants and bars is complex and involves balancing health concerns with personal freedoms and economic considerations. Ultimately, the decision should be based on a careful evaluation of the evidence and the needs and preferences of the community.             ",1
"You know I always wonder if I'm ever doing the right thing in life by coming to this university and not going somewhere else. I had opportunities to go to other universities but I chose to stay close to home. My parents always want it there way! They basically chose my major for me and when I wanted to change it, they became upset and really didn't want to see my face which made me upset. I want to do what my parents tell me to do but if it does not interest me and I know I'm going to stress over it, why should I bother to listen and I went with what I felt was best for me and I made the change. I always wonder how some people are so intelligent and others try so much but can't reach the level of that intelligent person based on academics. I see people trying so hard to make that A in that one class where the intelligent person doesn't take one ounce of effort to even study and this person would make a higher grade on the exam then the person who tried so hard to learn the material and study so hard on the exam. One thing which confuses me is how girls think. They're like in their own world sometimes. You try to be so nice to them sometimes and they look at you like you're the biggest IDIOT! I wish they would open up more around guys and not just talk with their girlfriends all the time. They should be able to tell their guy friends anything they tell their girlfriends. Why do the Astros suck so bad this year? They had a perfect baseball team and they're playing like a bunch of high school boys. They were recognized as favorites this season and they're ranked last in the division. They're is no excuse for being so mad especially a team so talented like the Astros. I mean if you had Bagwell, Biggio, Alou, Caminitti and other stars, wouldn't you expect your team to be good?? The rockets need to do better next year also. I can't believe they didn't pick up any free agents this summer. They could have really improved this year with all the talented free agents and they made the mistake of not picking up anyone. If they want to be really good again, they're going to have to pick up some talented free agents or they're not going anywhere and even in danger of not making the playoffs. I don't know why some teachers just don't tell us what will be on the exam. It would be so much easier to study the material but NO, they make us study everything even the non important information which really pisses of students, especially me. One thing I really love in the University are the girls. They are so damn hot! Only if I could have one of them would I show them what kind of man I really am! Its ok, one day, I will find the right one.",0
" Greetings, visitor from another planet!  Pollution refers to the presence or introduction of harmful substances into the environment that cause damage to living organisms, ecosystems, and the natural balance of the planet.  On our planet, pollution can come in many forms such as air pollution, water pollution, soil pollution, and even noise pollution. These pollutants can be released into the environment by various human activities such as industrial processes, transportation, and energy production, as well as natural phenomena such as volcanic eruptions and wildfires.  Pollution can have severe consequences for all living beings on Earth. For example, air pollution can lead to respiratory diseases, water pollution can make drinking water unsafe, and soil pollution can lead to reduced crop yields and ecological damage. Additionally, pollution can contribute to climate change, which can have catastrophic consequences for the planet as a whole.  To mitigate the effects of pollution, many individuals and organizations on our planet are working to reduce their impact on the environment through actions such as reducing waste, using renewable energy sources, and promoting sustainable practices.

"I wonder when my sister is going to be back from her meeting?  I am getting a little hungry. Kym's fan is so loud, and it is making the room so cold. I think I should turn if off in a second. It smells like chocolate in here which is making me even more hungry. I miss my cousin Tabby so much being three hours away is too far. I wonder what my brother is doing right now. He probably has football practice. I hope we win the football game this weekend. That reminds me, last weekend was so crazy I don't think I am ever going to drive someone else's car again. Gee that was an adventure though. I think I should wash clothes later because the pile is getting pretty high. Why does my phone light keep turning off and on? I really need to get a new one already. I hope my friend likes the birthday present I bought him. Everyone deserves a great present on their twentieth birthday! That new cd that I bought is great I actually feel like listening to it right now. Oh great I have calculus homework. That stuff is so confusing. It was just yesterday when I was talking to Joseph and he was saying he is having a hard time in his class over at Tech. He said, I wonder what I got myself into. "" And I began wondering that myself. Okay what was that cow noise that I just heard from my sisters computer? That thing is always making the weirdest sounds. My sister is so smart; I wish things came to me as easy as they come to her. But what do I know I'm just the middle child. My brother and sister are always saying I have ""middle child syndrome,"" but what is that anyway. I wonder if my dad is out of work already. He always has a busy work load. Man I never realized how many sacrifices he has really made for our family. I mean considering he is the only working parent and he has two children in college. Wow my dad is really smart too. And what do you know my dad and sis are alike in so many ways. I wish Tabby would come and visit us. I think it would be even better if she came to college up here too instead of back home. I am really attached to her. I mean we have spent almost everyday of our lives together and now I barely even get to see her on the weekends, and with college, it makes it even harder to keep in touch. I wonder how Danielle is doing at Duke. I bet she is having a ball. That is her dream college and I can't wait to hear the stories at Christmas. I wonder if my mom is making dinner back at home right now. Mmm I can almost smell it all the way over here. I am still hungry maybe I should go downstairs to get something to eat.",0

"This is the first writing assignment I have had in college. I'm a little nervous. I don't know why I should be worried about this because at least this writing assignment is an interesting one. I've never written in a stream of consciousness. I just lost my train of thought. I tend to do that. Actually, I constantly go off on these tangents as I hold any conversation. It's quite annoying. But hey, it's me. It's about to rain outside. I was just telling a friend about how hilarious it was that everyone noticed that it was raining when one student left early during class yesterday. And Professor Pennebaker was totally right when he said noone was paying attention anymore to what he was saying because we were all thinking, ""How the hell am I going to get home now?"". I laughed for a long time after that, but I was still thinking about the rain. After I ran out of class I noticed a lot of people were prepared, and had their umbrellas with them. I also noticed that the people with these umbrellas who were walking with someone else without an umbrella, did not share their umbrella with the other person. Not one of them. I thought that was extremely odd. I have never used the word umbrella so many times in one sentence. I'm very sleepy now. The rain tends to have that effect on me. I love the rain, not just for that reason but it's also soothing. But I do hate when it rains right before, or when I am about to go out. It's a hassle that I haven't had to deal with for a long time. I'm thinking we are in the middle of a drought. I can't wait until winter either. That time of year makes me happy. I don't know why I keep referring to weather. I'm not one of those, ""It's lovely weather we are having today"", kind of person.",0
" Reading a book to a child can be a fun and engaging way to promote their literacy skills, language development, and imagination. Here are some tips on how to read a book to a child:  Choose age-appropriate books: Select books that are appropriate for the child's age and developmental stage. Younger children may enjoy books with colorful illustrations and simple sentences, while older children may be more interested in chapter books with more complex storylines.  Create a cozy environment: Find a comfortable and quiet place to read the book with the child. Make sure there are no distractions, such as television or electronic devices, that could interrupt the reading experience.  Use expressive voice and gestures: Read the book with an animated voice and use facial expressions and gestures to convey emotions and emphasize important parts of the story. This can help keep the child engaged and interested in the story.  Encourage interaction: Ask the child questions about the story, characters, and illustrations to encourage their participation and understanding of the book. You can also pause and let the child predict what might happen next.  Make connections: Relate the story to the child's experiences or other books they have read. This can help the child understand the story and make it more meaningful to them.  Repeat favorite books: Children often enjoy hearing the same book repeatedly, so don't be afraid to read the same book multiple times. This can also help the child develop their memory and comprehension skills.  Remember that reading should be a fun and enjoyable experience for both the child and the reader. By following these tips, you can help promote a love of reading and learning in your child.       ",1
"  Throughout history, many people have fought for various causes, some of which have had a significant impact on society. Whether it be civil rights, gender equality, or environmental sustainability, there are many issues that are worth fighting for. However, one cause that I believe is particularly important to fight for is global poverty reduction.  Poverty is a pervasive and complex issue that affects millions of people around the world. According to the World Bank, around 9.2% of the global population, or roughly 689 million people, live in extreme poverty, defined as living on less than $1.90 per day. This number is even higher when taking into account those who live just above the poverty line but still struggle to make ends meet. Poverty can lead to a host of other issues, such as hunger, malnutrition, lack of access to healthcare, and limited educational opportunities. It is a cycle that can be difficult to break out of, particularly for those living in developing countries where access to resources and opportunities is limited.  Fighting global poverty is worth the effort because it is a moral imperative. As human beings, we have a responsibility to help those who are less fortunate than ourselves. It is unjust that some people have to suffer from poverty while others have access to abundance. By fighting poverty, we are not only improving the lives of individuals, but we are also creating a more just and equitable world.  Furthermore, reducing global poverty has significant benefits for everyone, not just those who are directly affected by it. Poverty reduction leads to economic growth and stability, as it allows more people to participate in the economy and contribute to their communities. It also promotes political stability and reduces the likelihood of conflict, as people who are struggling to survive are more likely to engage in criminal or violent behavior. Additionally, poverty reduction is good for the environment, as people who are living in poverty often have to resort to harmful practices to survive, such as deforestation or overfishing.  There are many ways to fight global poverty, including through foreign aid, trade policies, and investment in education and healthcare. It requires a concerted effort from governments, non-governmental organizations, and individuals alike. It is a long-term project that requires sustained investment and commitment, but the rewards are immense.  In conclusion, fighting global poverty is a cause that is worth fighting for. It is a moral imperative that promotes justice and equity, and it has significant benefits for everyone. By reducing poverty, we can create a more stable and sustainable world. It is a long-term project that requires sustained investment and commitment, but the rewards are immense. As individuals, we can support organizations that work to reduce poverty, advocate for policies that promote poverty reduction, and educate ourselves and others about the issue. Together, we can make a difference and create a better world for all.              ",1
" Building a birdhouse can be a fun and rewarding experience. Here are some steps to guide you through the process:  Materials needed:  Wood boards (cedar or pine) Saw Drill and bits Screws Wood glue Sandpaper Paint or wood stain Ruler or measuring tape Pencil Instructions:  Choose the type of birdhouse you want to build. There are many styles and designs to choose from, so do some research to find one that suits your needs.  Purchase the necessary materials. Cedar or pine wood boards are great for birdhouses because they are durable and weather-resistant. You will also need screws, wood glue, sandpaper, paint or wood stain, and a ruler or measuring tape.  Cut the wood boards to the appropriate size using a saw. For a basic birdhouse, you will need four pieces of wood: two sides, a front, and a back. The roof can be made from a single piece of wood or two pieces angled together.  Mark the entry hole on the front panel. The size of the entry hole will depend on the type of bird you want to attract. A 1.5-inch hole is good for attracting bluebirds, while a 1.25-inch hole is better for chickadees and nuthatches.  Drill the entry hole using a drill and a hole saw or spade bit.  Assemble the birdhouse by gluing and screwing the sides, front, and back panels together. Make sure the entry hole is facing forward and the bottom of the birdhouse is open for drainage.  Sand the birdhouse to remove any rough edges or splinters.  Paint or stain the birdhouse to protect it from the elements and make it look more attractive to birds.  Install the birdhouse in a safe and appropriate location. Make sure it is mounted securely and at the appropriate height for the type of bird you want to attract.  By following these steps, you can build a beautiful and functional birdhouse that will provide a safe and cozy home for your feathered friends.  ",1

"This is an interesting assignment to be doing. I don't like writing but this is different. I like being able to wrinte whatever pops into mw head and not worry about it being scrutinezed by an evil english teacher. Twenty minutes is a long time to be writing though. I could be doing sometinhg like playing a game of starcraft or half life right now, or writintg some c code. I am going to implement a router advertisement program to take advantage that windows boxes are stupid and let me remotly rewrite thier routing rules. Its nice of them to do this for me, but  I'll do that later. I wonder if I should write it under windows or Linux, or sine ither flavor of unix. I'll prob write it under windows if I gan get the neccesary access to the transport layer of the protocol stack just for that change of writing something usefull for windows. I actually have written some useful software for windows. Most of it would easily cross compile to unix. A fun peice of code I wrote takes a string such as ""sin(x)^6-3**4-x^(e^x)"" and evaluates it as a mathematical expression for a given value of x. If you've ever written code, this is not easy to do. I am listing to music right now. It helps stimulate the mind. :) I usually listen to music when programming. I am more productive that way. I am able to apporach problems and dig out the answer of some nasty place its hiding. 20 minutes sure is a long time when you would rather be doing something else. How many points do I get for doing this anyway. After I do thins I may go and eat or spend some time with Melissa, my girlfriend, who also happens to be my fiance  :)  she's great. After that I can write my router advertisement program. That would be fun. I love melissa. Being in austin is great. I like it much better that being in san antonio. I want there last weekend and wanted to be back up here the whole time. That could have been because all y stuff is up here. My parents miss me though. I sohuld call them. I;ll do that later. I have a lot of homework to do. Lets see, I'll check the chem web site after this and see what problems I have to do. I have to do the other assignment for this class later, and read. I have 2 sections of math, and reading and some homework in double E, college of engineering is college. I am a computer engr. student. EE is probably my best calss this semester, but psych is next, math is boring because it is going too slow (don't tewll my prof I wrote that) and I just don't like chem, the highlight of the class is when dr white starts singing. He is a weird guy. only 7 minutes before I can hit submit. I like UT. its a fun place to be. I need to buy another compputer. I host a site that provides free domain and web hosting to whoever wants it, and the boxes I have right now are slower thatn anything. I also need to call network soulutions and beat the m up until they do their jobs. I am hot. My apartment complex needs to fix the air conditioning. That would be good. aLl my roomates are in san antonio for the weekend, but I stayed here. I should call my parents later. That would be nice. I love melissa. 5 minutes left. my attention span is shortening. I will write my router advertisement prog first because melissa is sleeping. I need to go to HEB and buy some sprite.

" It is true that American society is known for its competitive nature. This competitiveness can be seen in various aspects of life, including education, sports, business, and even personal relationships. Many people argue that this level of competition is too high and can have negative consequences.  On the one hand, competition can be a good thing. It can motivate people to work harder, push themselves to achieve more, and strive for excellence. In a competitive environment, individuals are more likely to innovate and find new ways to succeed, which can lead to progress and growth. Additionally, competition can help individuals learn valuable skills such as teamwork, leadership, and communication, which are important in both personal and professional settings.  However, on the other hand, excessive competition can also have negative effects. For one, it can create a culture of stress and anxiety, as individuals feel pressure to constantly perform at high levels. This can lead to burnout and mental health issues, such as depression and anxiety. Additionally, competition can create a winner-takes-all mentality, where only a few individuals are able to succeed while the rest are left behind. This can result in inequality and a lack of social mobility, particularly in areas such as education and the job market.  In conclusion, American society is indeed known for its competitiveness, and while competition can have its benefits, it can also have negative consequences. It is up to individuals and society as a whole to strike a balance between healthy competition and excessive pressure, and to work towards creating a more equitable and inclusive society.

"Well,after I finally figured out how to get into all of this computer stuff,I'm going to calm down by writing. The first thing comes to my mind is I'm wondering whether I should go out tonight or not. I'm determined to finish all of my homework for this week and I'm sure that I'll finish everything by ten or ten thirty. But' my body really doesn't need for me to go out, but by ten or eleven o'clock I get really antsy. I'm proud of myself today because I took care of a lot of stuff that needed to do. I woke up at eleven, which is later than I wanted but I got moving right away. I went to TOP and bought all of my pictures and then I went to my Art History class. After class, Iwent with my two friends Sara and Whitney to University Realtors to figure out our living situation at Villas next year. It turned out that the apartment we wanted had already been taken after the guy said he would reserve it for us. So we got really mad at him and we worked it oit that we would move into the six bedroom apartment rather than the five bedroom apartment. Therefore, we had to get two more roommates. So we went over to Joanie's place and got Erin Vaughn and Joanie to live with us. It actually turned out for the better because the six bedroom place is for 8 people but since he screwed us over, we get to have nine people. With nine people, the rent ends up being cheaper. Since I'm sharing a room with my friend Jennifer, it'll be cheaper for us. I'm really excited about the girls I'll be living with next year because they are all really cool. My roommates for next year at Villas will be Anne, Carolyn, Jennifer, Paige, Sara, Whitney, Joanie, and Erin. I also had Ed on my mind today. He's my new boyfriend and I'm just crazy about him. Everybody says how great it is for me because he is such a nice guy and a gentlman. We just met about two and a half weeks ago and we were crazy about each other right away. Everyone is so surprised that I didn't know him before because we are so close already. Everyone asks how we met: he is my good guy friend's roommate. My guy friend is Will and right when Will moved into Towers, he wanted me to come over and see his place. So I went over there and I distinctly remembering Ed answer the door and I had met him for the first time. I thought he was so cute and we just talked for alittle while and our personalities seemed to click. Later that night, Ed called and invited me to the football game. Then we just started talking more and more and we just fell for each other. I've already screwed up a little bit in our relationship and I was terified that he would leave me. But, he forgave me and took me back right away and I'm so incredibly thankful. I never want to feel that bad again in my life. That's when I knew that I really was head over heels for him when I was terribly depressed over such a small mistake. I hope it works out for the future and all of my friends just tell me to grasp on to the now with your boyfriend and not to look ahead or else it could end up causing problems. I'm just so anxious about everything because this is my first real boyfriend ever. Well, my twenty minutes is up. Bye.",0
" I do not have personal preferences or biases. However, I can provide you with some objective information to help you make a decision between leasing or buying a new car based on your financial situation, driving habits, and preferences.  Leasing a car may be a better option if you prefer to drive a new car every few years and do not want to deal with the hassle of selling your vehicle. Lease payments are generally lower than car loan payments, and you can often get a higher-end vehicle for the same monthly payment as a lower-end car purchase. Additionally, you may have lower repair costs since the vehicle is usually covered under warranty during the lease term. However, keep in mind that you will not own the car at the end of the lease term, and there may be additional fees for excess mileage or wear and tear.  Buying a new car may be a better option if you want to own your vehicle outright and keep it for a longer period. With a car loan, you can spread out the cost of the vehicle over several years and may end up paying less in interest than you would with a lease. You also have more flexibility in terms of customization and modifications to the car. However, you may face higher repair costs once the vehicle is no longer covered under warranty, and you will have to deal with selling or trading in the vehicle when you are ready for a new one.  Ultimately, the decision between leasing or buying a new car depends on your personal circumstances and preferences. Consider your budget, driving habits, and long-term goals before making a decision. You may also want to consult with a financial advisor to determine the best option for your specific situation.

" I can try to generate an essay example for you based on the search results. Here is what I came up with:  A Change of Plans  Life is full of surprises and sometimes things do not go according to our plans. We may have to face unexpected challenges or opportunities that require us to adapt and change our course of action. In this essay, I will describe a situation where a change of plans became necessary and how I dealt with it.  Last year, I had planned to go on a vacation with my family to Hawaii. We had booked our flights and hotel months in advance and were looking forward to enjoying the sun, sand and sea. However, a week before our departure date, we received some bad news. My grandfather, who lived in another state, had suffered a stroke and was hospitalized. He was in critical condition and the doctors were not sure if he would survive.  My family and I were shocked and saddened by this news. We decided to cancel our vacation and fly to see my grandfather instead. We had to pay a lot of fees for changing our flights and hotel reservations, but we did not care about the money. We just wanted to be with him and support him.  We arrived at the hospital and saw my grandfather lying on a bed with tubes and wires attached to him. He looked pale and weak, but he recognized us and smiled faintly. We hugged him and told him how much we loved him. He could not speak much, but he squeezed our hands and nodded. We stayed with him for a few days, talking to him, reading to him, praying for him.  On the third day, we received some good news. The doctors said that my grandfather had shown some signs of improvement and that he might recover. They said that he would need a lot of rehabilitation and care, but he had a chance to live a normal life again. We were overjoyed and thanked them for their efforts.  We decided to stay with my grandfather for another week until he was stable enough to be transferred to a rehabilitation center. We helped him with his exercises, fed him, bathed him, cheered him up. He gradually regained some of his strength and speech. He thanked us for being there for him and said that we were his angels.  We finally returned home after two weeks of being away. We missed our vacation, but we did not regret our decision. We were glad that we could be with my grandfather when he needed us most. We learned that family is more important than anything else and that we should cherish every moment we have with them.  We also learned that life is unpredictable and that we should be flexible and adaptable when things change. We realized that sometimes a change of plans can be a blessing in disguise and lead us to something better than what we had planned.   ",1
" Arguments for mandatory seatbelt use:  Safety: Seatbelts save lives and reduce the severity of injuries in car accidents. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), seatbelt use reduces the risk of death and serious injury by about 50% in a car accident. In addition, seatbelts prevent occupants from being ejected from the vehicle, which is one of the most dangerous outcomes of a crash.  Cost savings: Seatbelt use can lead to cost savings in healthcare and insurance costs. Unrestrained occupants are more likely to suffer severe injuries, which require extensive medical treatment and rehabilitation. This results in higher healthcare costs and insurance premiums for everyone.  Public health: Promoting seatbelt use through mandatory laws can improve public health by reducing the number of fatalities and injuries from car accidents. This benefits not only the individuals involved in the accidents but also their families and communities.  Arguments against mandatory seatbelt use:  Personal freedom: Some people argue that mandatory seatbelt use violates their personal freedom and individual rights. They believe that adults should be free to make their own choices about whether or not to wear a seatbelt.  Effectiveness: Some opponents of mandatory seatbelt use argue that seatbelts are not effective in all types of accidents. For example, in rollover accidents, the roof can collapse and crush the occupants, regardless of whether or not they are wearing a seatbelt.  Enforcement: Mandatory seatbelt laws require enforcement, which can be costly and resource-intensive. Police officers have to monitor and issue citations to drivers who are not wearing seatbelts, which takes time away from other law enforcement activities.  In conclusion, while there are arguments on both sides, the evidence overwhelmingly supports the use of mandatory seatbelt laws. Seatbelts save lives, reduce healthcare costs, and improve public health. While some may argue that mandatory seatbelt use violates personal freedom, the benefits of seatbelt use outweigh the potential drawbacks.       ",1
"There is to much traffic in austin. I am ready to see my girlfriend this weekend. I am glad it is almost the weekend. The buses outside are to loud it is annoying. I guess it is really annoying when someone srives by with loud music in the middle of the night or rotc marches by. I'm thirsty I think I will get so water. I like this deja blue container it works good to refill. On yea that nice and cold. I guess I need to study my spanish when I am done with this. I wonder how my parents are doing, I guess I should call them pretty soon. Five min. and twenty seconds this is going by pretty fast. Tomorrow is friday horray. I am not really sure if that is how horray is spelled. It probaly isn't in the dictionary. There are always car alarms going off if someones car acutually gets robbed no one will know whose it is. That would suck. I like my bob marley poster it is interesting. I guess I should go work out a little today before work. I'll bet work is really boring tonight unless there are a lot of people at the fields. who know. That water tastes good. This psychology is kind of interesting but I still don't know what I am going to major in. It really does bug me I wish I could figure it out. Oh well mabye it will just hit me one day mabye I should just have fun. I need a different soap I don't really like this dail. I wish I wouldn't of bought a big ass bottle of it. It will take forever for me to use it. I wonder whats on tv. It would be kind of hard to watch will I am typing. I want hook up my speakers to my computer, I need to find that damn chord. I need to find someone with a printer for biology homework. What am I going to do when I am done with this I don't know if I really want to study. I guess I have to since I have to work tonight. Wow it is eighty degrees in here. I wonder how acurrate that galelio theremometer is. It seems like it would be pretty acurrate. galelio was a smart guy so why not. looks hot outside im glad I don't have to go out there till later. although it still won't be all that cool.",0
"i don't know what to write. I think that the music next door is a little loud, and it always is at least when I'm trying to study. when you are trying to concentrate it always seems as noises are amplified, such as my roommate, studing, every turn of a page is very loud. She is studying biology, which is unusual because usually she complains about having to study, and now she is actually studying. I'm suprised she hasn't yet complained that my typing is bothering her. I hope it's not, but does it really matter. Anyways, I hope this is what I'm supposed to be writing about, and I really hope that grammer and punctuation are not observed too closely. I think it's time for dinner, well really I don't have a choice if I want to eat on campus, since everything closes at 7. It reminds me of my job at a retirement community, where everything closes very early. I wonder how my grades will be at the end of this semester. hopefully good, it's kind of difficult though because UT is so much different than my high school. I mean this class has 500 people tha's more than my entire high school, probably close to twice as big. But, it was my choice to come here and now I must adjust to my new life style. Being in a big city is so much different from a small town, the smell, the people, everything. Rather than the pleasent smell of trees, or the occasional smell of a BarBQ, there is a strong smell of trash and the numerous buses. But, again it is all okay, and with time everything will seem normal. Is that necessarily a good thing, I wonder. What am I going to do after college, no one can tell me what to do with my life, so I have to decide. But should we be forced to decide so soon, i mean we just graduated from high school. there are so many choices and paths to choose, and what if we choose the wrong one, will we be able to turn around and go back. I picked up a package today, my mom sent me some URHA gifts. It's a good thing I actually checked the mail. At home I used to check it everyday, but here I never remember. I miss home, my dogs and my family, but mainly being familiar with everything and everybody. It's difficult to meet people, well at least for me it is. I can't just start talking to someone I don't know, but how will i ever meet anyone that way. the streets are noisy, i think its all the college, probably male, students driving by, engines roaring and music blasting, it's okay if they do that, but i'm trying to think about what I should type. This assignment should be equiped with spell check, that way you would never have to use the backspace button, or key whatever it is called. I really don't know anything about computers, which is kind of sad because my mom works for a computer company. Maybe that's the reason, why do i need to know when i could ask her and she could tell me. I reallt don't know what else to say I'm thinking that I'm glad that time is almost up because there are not any other things to talk about. These desk chairs are quiet uncomfortable, another reason I'm glad time is almost up. I sure have watched the time closely haven't I.",0
"  The question of what age is appropriate for driving is a complex one that involves various factors, including physical, cognitive, emotional, and social development. On the one hand, younger drivers may have faster reflexes and better vision, but they may also be more impulsive, inexperienced, and prone to risky behavior. On the other hand, older drivers may have more experience, but they may also have slower reaction times, decreased vision, and other age-related health issues.  Different countries and states have different laws regarding the minimum age for obtaining a driver's license. For example, in some European countries, the minimum age is 18, while in the United States, it varies from 14 (with restrictions) to 16 to 18, depending on the state. In some countries, the age limit also varies based on the type of vehicle, such as motorcycles, trucks, or buses.  The decision of what age is appropriate for driving ultimately depends on balancing the risks and benefits, as well as the cultural and social norms of a particular society. It also requires considering various factors, such as the quality of driver education and training, the availability of public transportation, and the prevalence of car accidents and fatalities.  In summary, there is no easy answer to the question of what age is appropriate for driving. It is a complex and multifaceted issue that requires careful consideration of various factors. Ultimately, the decision of what age to allow people to drive should be based on a balance of safety, practicality, and individual rights and responsibilities.    ",1
"Wow, I really don't know what to write. All I know is that I'm kinda behind on  my studies. The bad thing is that it's only been the first couple weeks of  school. I know I shouldn't procrastinate like this, but I just can't seem to help it.  That's why I'm doing this assignment at the last minute. Bad, huh?   Hummmmm, this chair is kinda uncomfortable. I just took  a shower and my hair is still kinda damp. I have really long hair, so it takes quite awhile for it to dry completely. I really miss my boyfriend. The funny thing (at least it's funny to me is that I'm Vietnamese and my boyfriend is black. Well his father is black and his mom is half Arabic and half French. My boyfriend,  Mohamed, was born in Africa but moved to Paris when he was only one years old. He's lived there for the past 18 years or so and have been here in the U. S for only two  years. He speaks five different languages. Pretty impressive, huh?  I have no idea why he hasn't called me yet. I haven't seen him in two weeks. I miss him sooo much. I wonder if he misses me or not. What do you think?  My problem is that  I'm not calling him until he calls me first. That's just the way I am. The guy always has to make the first move. I guess if he really wants to talk to me or hear my voice, then he will sooner or later pick up the phone. I really hope he will call soon. I really, really miss him. I guess it has to do with the fact that he is my very first boyfriend. If my parents ever find out I'm seeing a black guy, they would absolutely FREAK!  That's how they are. Actually, that's how  I kinda was. I told myself I would never ever like anyone but Asian guys. Boy, was I wrong. You know what, my arms are kinda getting tired now. For some  reason, I'm sitting real straight up in my seat. I never do this when I'm just  typing for the heck of it. Maybe the fact that I know this is for a grade makes  me a bit uneasy. Oh well, I don't mind. There, I kinda sat back a bit and it  feels a little bit better now. I just yawned. great, I need to stay up kinda  late tonight to do some other homework. I have ten more minutes but I don't know what else to write. I guess I type kinda fast, and so it seems as though I'm  writing a whole lot, huh?  I don't know how you are going to grade this. I know  it's gonna be a completion grade, but how are we going to benefit from this. I  bet you're just making us do this so whenever you don't have anything to do, you can just pull these up and give yourself a good laugh at our expense, huh?  NO, I'm just kidding. . Oh, Oh, OH, OH, yeah, yeah. I love you more than I can say. , I'll love you twice as much tomorrow, Oh, OH, I love you more than I can say. OH, don't you know I  need you so, OH tell me please, I gotta know. Do you mean to make me cry?  Am I just another gal,  That was just a song that I usually sing when my mind has nothing else on it. How do you like it?  It's kinda funny how sometimes I think of myself as pretty decent looking and at other times, I think I'm the ugliest troll. Why is that?  One day I would have complete confidence in myself and the next day I would feel so small and vulnerable. Why is it kinda weird for me to meet guys, especially Asian guys. Well, I kinda know the answer to that question. Since I'm Asian and I want to meet an Asian guy, I tend to feel more self conscience when I'm  around them and that results in a behavior that's not really mw. I've noticed lately that most of my guy friends are white guys. Because I don't really see them as a potential romance interest, I am very relaxed and calm with them, and I guess we just click like that. I know I should do the same with Asian guys, but it's hard just b/c they're Asian, also. Why is it so complicate, man?  Well, tomorrow, my friend Cheryl and I are gonna take a bus to the mall. I've only been on the  bus twice here around campus. I've never taken a bus on a highway before. I  have a feeling it's gonna be quite an experience for the both of us tomorrow. Wish me luck. Man, my whole arm is aching now!!!! Isn't that weird?  Okay, I'm gonna stop Bye-bye. . . . . . . . . .",0
" Chess is a strategic board game played by two players. The game consists of a board with 64 squares arranged in an 8x8 grid, and each player starts with 16 pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns. The objective of the game is to checkmate the opponent's king, which means putting it into a position where it is in check (threatened with capture) and there is no way to remove the threat.  The game is popular among players of all ages and skill levels because it requires strategic thinking, planning, and foresight. Each piece has its own unique way of moving, and players must carefully consider their moves and the potential consequences before making them. Players must also anticipate their opponent's moves and adjust their strategy accordingly.  Many people consider chess their favorite game because it offers endless possibilities for creativity, self-improvement, and challenge. There are countless strategies and tactics that players can use, and the game never gets boring because every game is different. Additionally, chess is a great way to improve cognitive skills such as memory, concentration, and problem-solving.  Overall, chess is a timeless classic that has stood the test of time and continues to be a favorite game for many people around the world.  ",1
"  In my opinion, a good education should be considered a fundamental right for everyone, not a privilege for a select few. There are several reasons why I hold this belief.  Firstly, education is essential for personal and societal development. It equips individuals with the knowledge and skills they need to be productive members of society and to contribute to the progress of their community. A good education not only helps people secure better-paying jobs and build successful careers but also enables them to make informed decisions and participate fully in the democratic process.  Secondly, education is a key factor in reducing poverty and inequality. Access to quality education can help break the cycle of poverty and open up opportunities for marginalized groups. By providing equal access to education for all individuals, regardless of their socioeconomic status, we can create a more just and equitable society.  Lastly, education is a right recognized by the United Nations. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1948, states that everyone has the right to education. This includes the right to free, compulsory primary education, and access to secondary and tertiary education. As such, it is the responsibility of governments and societies to ensure that this right is upheld.  In conclusion, a good education is a right, not a privilege. Access to quality education is essential for personal and societal development, reducing poverty and inequality, and upholding fundamental human rights. It is our collective responsibility to ensure that every individual has access to a good education, regardless of their background or circumstances.      ",1
" An ideal vacation is one that allows me to explore new places, cultures, and experiences, while also giving me time to relax and recharge. I would love to visit a destination that has a rich history, diverse scenery, and friendly people.   One possible destination that meets these criteria is Greece. Greece is a country that has a lot to offer for travelers who are interested in ancient civilizations, stunning landscapes, and delicious cuisine. I would start my vacation in Athens, the capital city and the cradle of democracy. I would visit the Acropolis, the Parthenon, and the National Archaeological Museum to learn more about the ancient Greeks and their achievements. I would also enjoy walking around the Plaka district, where I could shop for souvenirs, taste local delicacies, and watch street performers.  After spending a few days in Athens, I would take a ferry or a flight to one of the Greek islands, such as Santorini, Mykonos, or Crete. Each island has its own charm and beauty, but they all share some common features: white-washed houses, blue-domed churches, and breathtaking views of the Aegean Sea. I would spend my days on the island swimming in the crystal-clear water, sunbathing on the sandy beaches, and hiking on the volcanic trails. I would also explore the villages and towns on the island, where I could admire the architecture, visit the museums and galleries, and interact with the locals.  At night, I would enjoy the vibrant nightlife on the island, where I could dance at the clubs, listen to live music at the bars, or watch a movie at an open-air cinema. I would also sample the delicious Greek cuisine, such as moussaka, souvlaki, and baklava. I would try some of the local wines and spirits, such as ouzo and retsina. I would end my day by watching the sunset from my balcony or terrace, feeling grateful for the opportunity to experience such a wonderful place.  An ideal vacation for me is not only about seeing new sights and having fun activities. It is also about learning new things and gaining new perspectives. By visiting Greece, I would be able to immerse myself in a culture that has influenced many aspects of Western civilization. I would be able to appreciate the beauty and diversity of nature. I would be able to connect with people who have different backgrounds and lifestyles. I would be able to enrich my mind and soul with new knowledge and experiences.  An ideal vacation for me is also about finding balance and harmony. It is about having enough time to do what I want and what I need. It is about having enough space to be myself and to be with others. It is about having enough energy to explore and to relax. By visiting Greece, I would be able to achieve this balance and harmony. I would be able to enjoy both adventure and tranquility. I would be able to satisfy both my curiosity and my comfort.  An ideal vacation for me is one that leaves me with lasting memories and positive emotions. It is one that makes me feel happy and fulfilled. It is one that inspires me to travel more and to live more. By visiting Greece, I believe I would have such a vacation.     ",1
"I am pretty tired today. I haven't had much sleep in the last couple of weeks. I have been working pretty hard and now with school starting it is going to be even busier. I work with the youth group at the church I go to. It is getting very busy there as well. We are really trying to get the numbers back up. After the summer the kids seemed to move away and the number of kids seemed to falter a little. Right now I am making a pot of coffee and getting ready to put in a hard day of studying. I was supposed to go to work today but there is nothing for us to do so we are staying home. We are working construction on our new church building. It is very exciting. We have to do a lot of demolition, and to help us out the fire department said they had some guys to train to breech walls. So for the last week they have been breaking through walls. It has been really cool to watch. My coffee smells really good. I am listening to some Audio Adrenaline. They are a Christian band I just downloaded. They sound pretty good, nothing that great about them though. I am switching majors this semester from Engineering to a dual major in History and Spanish, pretty drastic transfer huh?  I think it will be good. I got accepted into the UTeach program and so starting this semester I will be in an Austin public school teaching and observing. I will be in the classroom starting next week. I am very excited. My arms are getting really tired from writing so much and it has only been six minutes. I think they are going to fall off. I have a lot to do today. Since I am not working it will give me a good opportunity to catch up. I think I will be pretty far behind in this class PSY 301 because the Co-OP does not have the book(it is out of stock) They won't have it until Monday the 8th. I'll just have to read a lot next week. I need to do laundry today and maybe clean my truck. I am trying to sell my truck. It is a big beast and gets horrible gas mileage. About 10 miles per gallon. I think I will put it on Auto trader and see what I can get for it there. My coffee is done and it is calling my name. Come. Drink me. ""   I guess I will just have to wait another. oh my gosh. 10 minutes. I am losing my thoughts because my arms hurt so bad and I am really tired. I have to read six books for my History class. It's not so bad I have alreay read one of them and have started on another. The first was very boring. I think the rest will get better. This is a good song. I am also taking Chem 302 I think it will be a challenge because I don't really remember Chem 301 that well. I kind of breezed through it and didn't really learn any of the material. What other classes do I have?. I am trying to teach myself Spanish right now. It is fun. I think I can use Spanish a lot later in life. I hope to do some missionary work and maybe go into youth/college ministry. But who knows what the big guy has in store for me. College age has a lot of possibilities. I am hoping to maybe get something started this semester. I don't know how that is going to turn out but I think it will be fun. THis last summer me and a couple of friends went to Colorado did some fly fishing, landscape photography, and climbed Mt. Elbert (which is the highest peak in the Rockies @ 14,433)  It was a lot of fun. I and looking at a picture of me and my friend Chris. It is of when we went skydiving last year. That was a whole lot of fun. ""People may doubt what you say, but they will always believe what you do"". Reads a poster on my wall.

It's biology and I like the class, but I just caught up with the reading yesterday and then now we have to read a another whole chapter which I am not to excited about. My foot is starting to hurt because I was sitting on it weird, adn now it's asleep. I hate the feeling you get when your foot is trying to wake back up I guess you would call it. This CD that I'm listening to has quite a mix on it. now we're listening to the beatles. It's not my CD or I would know what is on it. I wonder if they will ever completely stop illegal downloading of music on the internet. I mean there's no really way that you can stop anything on the internet. It's too vast and someone will allays think of a way to get around things. I have a download capability on my computer but I don't use it all that often, so I doubt the people like me are the ones they are really after. I understand that some musicians are angry because it takes away from their profits, but downloading allows the person to listen to their music, decide if they like it or not, and then decide to buy the cd. Many of the songs that you download on the internet are not the best quality, so it is easier to just go out and buy the CD. I have no idea who this song playing is by. I still have exes on my hands from the bar last night, I really need to try and wash them off before I forget about it and go to class with them still on. I don't like the way they write exes on your hands. Is not one hand enough? They really don't need to mark both of them. I don't even think you could wash them off in the bathroom of the bar if you wanted to. There would be too much of a chance that they would catch you and throw you out, which would be really embarrassing. Last night was okay, it was not nearly as much fun as I was expecting it to be. Well maybe if my date had showed up, it would've been more fun. I'm not too worried about it though, my boyfriend comes into town tonight so I'm more excited about that. He is not coming in until much later though, I wish he could come earlier. I also need to make sure my friend is going to come up for Lion Hunt, another thing that the sorority throws. Life is so hectic at college, I don't ahve time to really do anything. I don't know how some people do it. They can just go to class, not do any of the reading and be okay with that. If I'm behind in a class it bothers me until I get it done. Then after I sit down and do the reading or the homework, everything's so much better. All I did yesterday afternoon was read. I'm caught up in psychology and journalism finally. But then next week, the cycle starts all over again. I guess that's why I feel like I'm never caught up completely. We're listening to School's Out for Summer"", I wish it was! But that won't happen for a very very long time. But I had fun this summer. I didn't have a job, so I got to do whatever I wanted. It was fun. I really need to straighten up my room, it's got clothes everywhere. They're all clean but thrown around from when I was trying to figure out what to wear last night. I need to go to the grocery store too, I'm out of bottled water and drinks. I need to get more hangers too. Ok enough of this random writing, my 20 minutes are up.",0
"I already wrote a 20 min passage for this assignment. Unfortunately, when I tried to submit it, it didn't work. There was some sort of error and now I am having to redo the entire thing. So basically, I simply feel frustrated that I have to redo this assignment when I could be using my time for something much more useful than this. Beyond that, my thoughts are concentrated on my future. I am currently trying to decide what I am going to do with the rest of my life. I feel as though this is a very big decision. well, it is! My decision today is going to affect the sequence of events for the rest of my life. My career choice will determine what kind of people I meet and what kind of contribution I make to the world, and what the value of my work will have. It is important to me that I make a good decision. For this reason, I feel a lot of pressure to choose wisely and not rashly. I want something that will be viewed as impressive and intelligent. I suppose this shouldn't really be a factor. After all, isn't the most important thing that I am satisfied with my job? The opinions of others shouldn't influence me. And yet, I want people to think that I am intelligent. I can't help it. That is just the way I am. Perhaps I have a bit more of Peter Keating and a bit less of Howard Roark in my than I would like. Another important factor is the value of my work. I would like to have the satisfaction of contributing something useful to the world. For example if I were a microbiologist, I could work in the medical field to find a cure for a disease. Another important factor is money. I would like to say that money isn't important. However, this is a lie. I want very much to make enough money to be able to enjoy life. I want to be able to order food at a restaurant without considering the price. I want to be able to go on vacations every year. I want to see the world. Of course I need someone to have fun with while I do these things but that would fill up an entire additional 20 of writing if I went into my thoughts on social and antisocial feelings. The underlying point here is that I want to have money to do things that will help me enjoy my life. If these were the only criteria, I think I could find a job fairly easily. The real clincher is the next criterion. I want to enjoy my job. I know that some people think this is not important, my dad being one of those people. However, I don't want to spend the rest of my life in a job that I am going to hate. I don't wan t to get up in the morning and dread going to my job. I don't want to have to drag myself out of my bed. I am going to spend many hours every week at my job and so I want to make sure I enjoy it. Not only do I want to enjoy it, I want to make sure I choose the career that I will enjoy THE MOST. Perhaps this is the reason that I find it so difficult to make a career decision. I feel as though I am currently being productive in my career quest. I added a class this semester that will allow me to explore engineering and determine if I might possibly love a career in architectural engineering. If not, I have determined that I should remain in the college of natural science because that is where I will find a courseload that interests me the most. Surely if I choose a major that interests me, a career that interests me will be a corollary.",0
"I feel good about hanging out with different people throughout the day. I find that it gets so monotonous when I see the same person day in and day out. I don't like feeling trapped in a relationship, so I guess I am very wary of commitment, although I wouldn't mind starting a relationship with someone. I miss the physical contact of a relationship. Maybe I haven't been getting enough hugs lately. I haven't had one for about a week now. It does make a difference. You have to fend for yourself here at UT. No one is going to be your babysitter, and sometimes that's hard for me to accept. I have to take care of my own health, academic career, make my own friends and spend time with them, and also join organizations that I deem worthwhile. It seems like a lot of responsibility, but I am gradually learning how to handle it. I have never realized before how incredibly independent I am. I am in fact, lonely a lot more than I thought I was. At home I didn't feel it as much because I lived with four other people. But now, I notice that I get timid when I am alone. I didn't have a roommate for 2 weeks, and I thought I would like it because I would get privacy and free reign over the room. But I didn't realize how anxious being alone made me. I started eating a lot to fill the void. I never could figure out why I binged so much before, especially during high school. But now I think that I felt alone, and I was ashamed to ask someone to be my company. So I would eat to fill the lonely space and cover the shame. That's weird how I wanted to be even more alone when I felt isolated. Now I want to get involved with people as much as possible since I have recognized the problem. Liz and I will try to hang out more now, at least once a week. I want to have my meals with at least one other person. It sucks to be alone, but at least I know that now. I have ten minutes to write. Working out sure refreshes you and makes you feel more alive, but it sure does make you tired. It's also my blood sugarit's a tad low now and I will be eating something for lunch soon. I don't want to eat alone! Maybe Brooke will eat w/me. I wonder what Jason's up to now. He had an 8:00 class this morningI think? We spent some time with each other this weekend, which was a lot of fun. I like being around him because he is so patient and has some good things to say. He's also very open about himself, which is a new thing for me. I don't know if I would want to start something with him. It would be a fun thing and add some ""extra"" to the relationship, but sometimes it makes things weird and I would not want to lose his friendship. I will just keep on doing my thing, and improving myself and if it happens, it happens. I just want to be able to spend some time with him! I know I will though. There is that Navigator lake house bash this weekend that he told me about, and I think I should go. I don't want to know what I look like in my bathing suit right now. hard workouts this week should help. Will I feel pressured a lot about GodI just don't know if I'm on the right track. I read that the best way to get closer to God is to Spend time with Him. I so don't do that. I think about God about once or twice a day. I've also heard that the good things we do are reflections of God working in us, or something. I try to remember to do those little things: hold the door for people, smile, encourage people, be honest, but also don't try to be fake friendly, because it's not in anyone's good interest. I just want to be me. God I know that you know the best way for me, don't let me be so selfabsorbed. If I just let go a little, I can go a long way with YOU. But my gosh it's hard to let go. Let me see the ways I can let go. I'm going to go get something to eat for lunch.",0
"Right now I am feeling much rage and it stems from the outcome of this weekend. I had traveled for three hours to visit my family and friends hoping that I would be welcomed with opened arms. Half of my theory was right. My family welcomed me with much warmth but my friends pretty much took a dump on my face. Well not all of them. A few in particular. My whole weekend was, in my mind a total waste of time. My so called best friends would rather spend time with their ridiculously uptight and stuck up girlfriends than to hang out with a best friend. I had known them my entire life and these girls just walked into the picture less than a couple of months ago. Nothing but anger subdued my mind for the following three days. I refused to let myself be depressed so I figured I would go shoot some pool. But to my dismay, one of my friends showed up, this one was one of my female counterparts, and she pranced in with a guy standing next to her. So what. That part didn't piss me off as much as the fact that they were at a party and didn't bother to pick up the phone. Not even to say hi. She did not even return my calls or answer my pages. To make it even worse, she pretended she did nothing wrong and pursued to make friendly conversation. To hell with that. I walked out of there without even saying good bye or giving a reason why. My mind was filled with so much raw emotion, the negative kind that can tear a hole through your soul. That's when I realized that Houston was no longer my home. I no longer had any true friends in the city that I grew up in for 18 years. Like I said, my friends had pretty much crapped in my mouth. I'm not sure if they were aware or not but that is completly beside the point. I am home now. The city of Austin where I would rather meet and make new friends than to salvage the friendships that I already had. I believe it is a wise choice otherwise I will just continue to be put in such an unstable emotional state. Not once this whole weekend I had a good thought in my mind. I was fine until my so called friends sold me out to be with a girl all night so that they could get freaky with each other. I've got no problem with my friends being horny and wanting to get it on with their girlfriends but at least hang out with me for one damn night out of three. Now I can relax and look forward to this weekend where I will undoubtedly have a good time while my friends stay at home with their thumbs up each other's asses. Screw all of them. I don't need them anymore than I need the toilet paper I wipe my ass with. Austin is a hell of a lot more exciting than houston and my asshole friends can stay there because they were too damn stupid to get into UT in the first place. I hope they are having fun at community college, or high school for those that were too dumb to even graduate high school. Good luck flipping those burgers at McDonald's the rest of your lives.",0
" A world-class athlete is someone who performs at the highest level of their sport, competes internationally, and achieves outstanding results. There are many examples of world-class athletes from different sports and countries, but for this essay, I will focus on one: Simone Biles.  Simone Biles is a world-class athlete in gymnastics. She is widely regarded as the greatest gymnast of all time, and has won a record-breaking 25 medals at the World Championships, including 19 golds. She also has four Olympic gold medals and one bronze from the 2016 Rio Games. She is the first woman to win five all-around titles at the World Championships, and the first gymnast to perform several difficult skills that are named after her.  Simone Biles deserves to be in the category of world-class athletes because of her exceptional talent, dedication, and resilience. She started gymnastics at the age of six, and quickly showed her potential. She trained hard for many hours a day, balancing her sport with her education and personal life. She overcame many challenges and obstacles, such as poverty, racism, abuse, injuries, and mental health issues. She always showed courage and grace under pressure, and never gave up on her dreams.  Simone Biles is not only a world-class athlete, but also a role model and an inspiration for many people around the world. She uses her platform to advocate for social justice, women’s rights, and mental health awareness. She supports various causes and charities, such as UNICEF, Special Olympics, and The Biles Foundation. She also encourages young girls to pursue their passions and believe in themselves.  In conclusion, Simone Biles is a world-class athlete who has achieved remarkable feats in gymnastics and beyond. She exemplifies what it means to be a world-class athlete: someone who excels in their sport, competes at the highest level, and makes a positive impact on society.       ",1
" Each decade has its unique characteristics, and people may have different reasons for choosing a specific period. However, each era also had its challenges and limitations, such as social inequality, political unrest, and technological disadvantages.  That being said, I can provide some general information about popular decades and their significant events and cultural trends:  1920s (Roaring Twenties): This decade was characterized by cultural revolutions, including the rise of jazz music, flapper fashion, and prohibition. It was also a time of economic prosperity and industrial growth, but it was followed by the Great Depression.  1950s (Post-War Era): After World War II, the 1950s saw a rise in consumerism and suburbanization, as well as the beginning of the civil rights movement. Popular culture included the rise of rock 'n' roll music and television shows, but it was also marked by social conformity and political paranoia.  1960s (Counterculture Movement): The 1960s were a time of political and social upheaval, with the civil rights movement, anti-war protests, and the rise of the counterculture movement. It was also marked by the space race, the Vietnam War, and the assassination of prominent figures. Popular culture included the rise of psychedelic music and fashion, as well as the sexual revolution.  1980s (Reagan Era): The 1980s were marked by the conservative policies of the Reagan administration and the rise of neoliberalism. Popular culture included the rise of MTV and music videos, the emergence of hip-hop, and the influence of Hollywood movies.  Ultimately, the choice of which decade to live in is a matter of personal preference and depends on what aspects of that era one finds appealing. ",1
"It's 805 now; I feel like I'm playing who wants to be a millionaire, waiting for the time to change. Yeah. Really that's what I just said. Why is my roommate talking to me? She knows I'm doing this assignment. Ahhhhhhhh. That was really annoying, I'm not sure if I just meant my roommate or me. I sometimes think I don't know the meaning of half of what I say (even though I didn't say that) I just completely lost track of what I was writing cause she talked to me again. Blah blah blah. Why do I do that? Anyway, I want to have more dreams. Really bad. Good dreams where I don't want to wake up; like the one I had when I was little and it was so cool there were these lonely French 12 year old kids in it and I was standing outside their house window or something; they remind me of mafia and the untouchables; my secret song that I swear is about the untouchables. I wish I knew what song it was. That would be great. I wonder if I'm making too much of my friend 'coming out'. Like I'm ok with it, and most everybody is ok with it, but I might be trying to sound TOO ok with it. I don't know. My roommate's parents don't like me, I don't think. But I'm not entirely sure so I shouldn't even think that, let alone say it. Or write it. Aren't I supposed to be typing about my feelings? Ok, I feel like I keep trying to prove myself to my friend Angela, just cause she is so wonderful and I don't feel too wonderful myself a lot of the time. But I don't try to prove myself to her; I did to my friend Ali, but not to Angela. I don't even know what I'm talking about right now. I hate that; I'll think something about somebody just cause I had thought it about someone else. And I don't know if that's bad or good or whatever. I'm typing too much too fast; I keep getting myself confused and backspacing. I wonder if I should just leave all the misspellings in here; it might make sense so far as the paper goes, since maybe that would suggest that my mind's confused and jumbled, the way handwriting is supposed to tell about you, but I don't know at all. Cause we're supposed to correct our misspellings. The Buddy Holly song is in my head. Does that mean I should sing it to the paper since it's in my head and whatever's in my head should be going down here? No, I don't think so; it's kind of like background music; jazz to Kerouac type of thing. I wonder if I'm as important to Grant as he is to me. That goes with all my friends. He should be here soon; no tape for me. This makes no sense, I'm sure; I sound horrible, like Adrian Mole, except for I keep criticizing myself as Adrian keeps complimenting myself. My back hurts; I wonder if my doctor who I went to once was right when I said I was going to have neck and back problems later, just cause I don't have the greatest posture in the world. I mean, my philosophy professor said today that if pleasure is virtue then he was virtuous in smoking, and he wasn't lying, but I don't think that there is any virtue in slouching. Is this what fist person books are supposed to be like? Cause characters would never be able to write this much; no, what I meant was that it would sound dumb and pointless and rambling like this, unless they had some superb, Staten island computer guy like mind. Like that last reference wouldn't make any sense at all to anyone but me; in books they describe it. I don't know. Like Kerouac I guess. Bless you. There, I said it in response to my roommate's sneeze on here at least. I don't think of her as Elizabeth, cause she's not, she's my roommate. Elizabeth's a dead girl who used to laugh at a camping trip where she got sick on the day of a campout; no a bonfire; who used to like peanut butter. Elizabeth did, not the peanut butter. Why is everyone homesick (or my roommate). I'm not; I want to talk to my cat though. He's going to hate me when I get home. Like, it'll be like when my mom took him into surgery and he would run away from her. I hope he doesn't die. I'm missing all of the little things in between these thoughts; the thoughts I have while I'm typing. I would try to type those things too but then there would be things while I was typing that. I hate paper, I miss trees. There goes my roommate complaining again. But I'll stop, cause she might come over and read over my shoulder or something and I'll have to stop like I did the first time I tried to do this exercise; that was horrible, it was only 2 minutes into it, but still. But she came close to here, and I don't know. Good, she's on the phone now. I'm staring at the little monitor light on my computer; it looks like some alien symbol for sex or something; I don't know what I'm thinking (tip of the tongue) but its weird whatever it is. I want to be in Rocky Horror. I wonder what it's like to be in it; just in the movie, not the little plays during it. Yesssssssss, noooooooooooo. I don't know. It's 8:22. Why the hell did I type yessssssssss? Remember on the Wonder Years, and they would have to go to typing class; that's what I think my mom's childhood was like. My lips feel like they're about to fall apart if I smile again; not because I've been smiling too much, because they're really chapped along the edges. Two minutes left. Yess. I did it again. I want to go out to breakfast; real breakfast, with eggs and pancakes you don't have to tear apart with your teeth to cut. I'm looking at my chopsticks now; I wonder why people are so fascinated with them, why I brought them, I don't know at all. And I'm feeling bad about having a goodluck elephant made out of ivory, cause doesn't that go against the good luck of elephants?",0

"last night was pretty good and all. I was glad to see everyone thats in san antonio again and javi who is still at home and hating it. but who can blame the guy, weslaco isn't exactly the place one would want to be. I just feel bad for junior, he feels totally alone and stuff. javi and him are the only two who are still at home and all, but junior never talks to javi because he doesn't like what javi does on his spare time, so because of that, he doesn't talk to him as much. I was just glad he called on davids birthday to wish him a happy birthday and to talk, I miss that guy a lot, I just wish hed get off of his lazy ass and do something. he isn't working or going to school, hes just at home feeling sorry for himself and ballooning. all I could tell him is that he needed to do something to occupy himself and to not just sit thete and feel sorry for himself. hopefully he'll be here in austin visiting soon. speaking of getting off your ass, I need to get on the ball and stop procrastinating. high school might have been somewhat of a breeze through (a walk in the park) but college isn't the same, needless to say. dad said this is the rest of my life I'm preparing for, and there isn't a day that goes by that I don't say that quote to myself at least a hundred times because I'm being lazy. I miss dad, and mom and everyone else. yea we all hate eachother and get at eachothers throats but thats why we're family, only we can talk to eachother the way we do and get away with it. much like me and my friends, because friends are family too, even knowing more about you than you might through observation. regardless, I love austin, its a great town, there is so much to do, and a lot of time to do it in, but with all this free time you need to do it in moderation, because too much of a good thing can be bad for you. I hope grandma is ok, I miss waking up and telling her ""buenos dias, como manecio"" and her being amazed that I'm even at home and even more amazed at the time it is that I wake up. I just hope nothing happens to her. I feel sorry for mel and all the trauma that she is probably feeling. she just had a kid, her husband is being accused of something we are all sure that he had nothing to do with, and the damn police with their false accusations the they are giving her, as well as the threats, in order to get her to tell them the information they believe she has, but which in fact she doesn't. because no matter how bad the news, she would come to my family first and let us know before her own mother would know, because she is like my oldest sister, and she is probably the closest cousin that I may have. damn, I miss georgie. stupid punk with too much time on his hands and he knows it. procrastinator in the making just like me. I miss listening to my punk and ska with him, he was the only person that liked it as much as I did, and I didnt even force him to like it. funny now though, in austin one would say that its a bit ""trendy"" to like this music, but in weslaco. its not really known. and even less played on the damn radio. speaking of radio, it sux. except for some stations in austin. and I don't know the call letters. I'm bad at remembering things. I guess that may be why I procrastinate. my dad has always told me that its impossible to forget things as quickly as I do, so I know he doesn't believe me when I say ""I don't remember"". but in fact, I really don't, and its not because I drink like every day or because I'm on a drug, because yes I do drink, but not in large quantities (binge drinking) like some people and I only do so on the weekends strictly never on school days, and I don't do drugs. speaking of drugs, I knew it was easy to get them at my hometown if u wanted them, but austin is like a haven for those who feel the urge to get away. already I have open invitations from people I've met and seen a few times to go and smoke out with them, and one guy who said he could get me any drug I wanted free for the first time. I can just brush these things aside because they don't interest me or anything, but I get some weird looks from other people nearby who can hear the conversation, but I don't let that bother me, because if they are going to judge me from what they hear and not by who I really am, they arent worth my time. my dad told me to never judge anyone by what is heard and said, and I never have. some of my best friends today were spoken bad of before I had ever met them. now we're as close as brothers in a sense. I love my friends, I don't really know what id do without them. my biggest fear doesn't seem to be what kind of future I have or if I will ever be successful, or if I will let my parents down (god forbid though), but my biggest fear is never seeing my friends again. but when I think about it, its the stupidist thing, because today, the world is smaller than ever, and anyone can be found with the click of a button. so I don't really know why I feel this way or anything, nothing traumatic has happened to make me feel this way, so I don't really have an explanation for this feeling, and being the smart ass that I am making fun of everything with a comment for everything, this really does scare me",0
"Right now I am sitting in my dorm room thinking about how much reading I have to finish tonight. I am listening to the radio as I write this. Jessica Simpson is what I am listening to. I am also thinking about how many typing errors I make as I type. I am drinking Pink Lemonade and chewing Orbit gum. I am also thinking about my boyfriend, and waiting for either an email or a phone call from Kuwait. I am very worried about him, but he reassures me everyday that he will be ok. I have to read a lot of Biology tonight. I also have to get my clothes together for tomorrow morning. Tomorrow is the start of my first full week as a college student. I don't like college to much, it is quite boring and time consuming. I would prefer to be going to college closer to home or at home, but here is where I find myself. Oh well, it's okay. I'm testing the waters and seeing how I like this place. So far so good, the football games are fun and my classes are interesting. Except for one of my Biology classes, my professor is evil. I wish that my boyfriend would call, I would really like to talk to him. I miss him so much, and I can't wait till he comes home. I have lots of pictures of my family and boyfriend in my room. They are all over, I miss them all so much. I hate being this far from them, but I have to do what I have to do. I am full from eating a giant burrito at Freebirds about an hour ago. I keep staring at my cell phone hoping someone will call me. I still have to do some Pre Calculus homework and read for Psychology too. I received one Instant Message, I wonder who it was from. Probably my little cousin who bothers me all the time. Everytime someone signs on and off the internet that annoying door sound plays. It gets on my nerves. I wish it was Saturday still, I had fun on Saturday. I am tired of typing and I want to start my reading so I can go to bed. My roommate is going to Jack n the Box, and she asked if I wanted anything, but I do not like burgers or greasy food anymore. Plus I am watching my figure and do not want to get the dreaded Freshman 15!"" I just got an email but I can't read it until this is over I want to read it so bad because it might be from my boyfriend. Dang I so wish that I could check my email, with my luck it probably was my boyfriend. My music stopped and no it is silent in my room but I can hear some music from my RA's room. I think her roommate is playing the music. It sounds funny from here but oh well. I'm really tired from staying up so late of Friday night, but I guess that's what I get. This gum is already starting to lose flavor and I just barely put it in my mouth. Yuck! Blah! I got new sunglasses this weekend. I like them a lot. I got to shop some this weekend, and I bought more food for my room. I didn't need any of it, but it was definitely a spur of the moment type thing. I really need to read my Biology so I can read my Psychology so that I can take a shower and go to bed. It's only been 13 minutes since I began typing and I feel like I have been typing forever. I am worried about my Biology class and I hope I do good. I don't want to let anyone back home down. I want to be able to prove my ex friend wrong that I can be on my own, since she was to chicken to leave home. But I don't like her anyways, she has an obsession with thinking my world revolves around her, when obviously hers revolves around me. I don't know if that made sense, but I don't really care. Only five more minutes left and I am running out of things to write about. I got another email and now I am pretty sure it is my boyfriend. This is the longest 5 minutes of my life. I also have never made this many mistakes when I type. Oh well. I want to run downstairs and get myself some snacks. I wish I could go get some right now but I have to finish writing. I realize that I can't wait to get something over with and then when I start it I don't really feel like finishing it. Oh well, only a little bit more time left. Then I can cross this off my to-do list for the week. I miss my boyfriend so much, I cannot wait till he comes home. I get to go home next month! YAY! I can't wait to see my family and my puppy! I am thinking about all the times I had when I was at home. I had a sense of security there, I am very family oriented and I miss them a lot. Only 30 seconds left. And then I have more to do tonight. I have so much to do in so little time. Time to get it all done so I'm not swamped this week.",0
"I'm thinking about what I need to do before classes start again, but every time I  get started, something interrupts me or I just don't feel like doing it. I'm sitting in my  room in front of my awesome new computer listening to the 'Wicked"" soundtrack,  it's amazing. my room smelled before, but I cleaned the kitchen so now it doesn't  smell anymore. stacy just walked in my room and I yelled at her because I am not  supposed to be disturbed during my writing assignments. I'm feeling kind of gross,  actually. I feel gross because it's the end of the weekend and I was out partying  the whole time. I hate when people are like, ""yeah I party"", but I seriously did the  whole weekend. now I feel dirty and gross. I also ate like crap this whole weekend. ew. during the week I'm so healthy and so conscious of what I eat, and then the  weekend comes and it's like I've never seen food before. what is that about? so  now I feel gross because I feel like I ate the entire state of texas and I'm disgusting. I'll get over it. I kind of miss camp right now, even though I would never go back. I  miss sam israel and hilly and weisberg. those three are like my favorite people in  the world. this time seems to be going by so slowly. I feel like I've been writing  forever and I haven't. weird. so back to camp. I miss it because I was so  comfortable and so happy. here, I'm not used to everything yet. and I miss those  three girls because I know that they will always be there and I've known them  forever. I'm still getting to know people here, which is fun because I love to meet  new people, but sometimes I long for that feeling of comfort and not having to  impress or look good for anyone. you know what I mean? and I also miss adam. this is something I could talk about for a while but I don't really know if I want to. it's  our 4 year anniversary in a couple of days but the card and present that I sent him  won't get there on the 8th, I feel kind of bad about that. what can I do? it was so  weird when ross called me the other night, what the f? I'm running out of things to  talk about. I love traci, my suitemate. I knew her from camp and I'm really glad we  decided to live together. despite what everyone said, I knew it would be a good  decision. we've been getting along really well. I'm thinking about ""friends"" right  now because it's my favorite show. I love it so much, and I'm so sad that it's over. but I'm excited to watch ""joey"" on Thursday. I'm definitely going to support him even if  the show sucks, though I doubt it will. this is random but I'm going to run out of soap  and shampoo soon, I'm going to have to go to eckerd's to buy more, and I need to  return some books to the co-op outlet because there were some books that I didn't  need. hopefully I'll get store credit, and then I can buy some stuff. that would be  awesome! I need to return my chemistry and old psychology book. I found out that  I was in the chemistry class for science majors, and let me tell you that I'm the  furthest thing from a science major. I hate science. well I don't hate it but I definitely  don't belong in that class. so I switched into chemistry in context which is for sure  more my pace. and I actually swtiched into this class after classes had started and  I found out that I bought the wrong book. I just figured something out about me. I  hate bad spellers. so random, I know, but I see myself typing and every time I'm  about to spell something wrong or I mistype, I get so angry. I don't know how  people can just leave words mispelled. I hope nobody reads this because they'll  think I'm such a weird kid. which I am, but not everyone needs to know that. my  brother, danny, always tells me I'm a weird kid. he's so funny. and whenever I talk  about him to other people, they always ask how old he is, and then they are  surprised when I tell them that he's 16, because the way I talk about him, it sounds  like he's older. danny always gives me orders and bosses me around, but in a  funny way, not in a serious way. people always make fun of our family by calling  us the ""brady bunch"" because  no one ever seems to fight in my family. I don't  know why, but we all just get along. my older sister is my best friend in the entire  world. sure, we get annoyed with each other every once in  a while, but she is  absolutely the first person that I go to with a problem and she's the first person I tell  things to. and danny is awesome. there's nothing not to like about him. he's so  cute, nice, smart, funny, he's a great catch. some day, girls are going to fall all over  him. they should. me and andi (my sister) always say that we would date danny if  he wasn't our brother. he's such a cute kid. I'm kind of mad at him though because  I haven't talked to him in a really long time and he said that he would call me and  he didn't. I hate when people do that. I really don't know what else to talk about. I  guess I can go through my high school friends and talk about them because then  I'll have plenty to say. I hope that's still following the assignment. so I'll start with  olivia geyelin. I don't even know why I'm writing about her because she sucks. I  mean, I hate this girl. she might be the dumbest person I know, and she's always  complaining and never knows what's going on. she gets mad at everyone for the  dumbest reasons. ew. but I kind of feel bad for her because she's got the worst  family life ever. ok I'm sick of olivia, now I'll talk about rikki spreckman. ok, I used to  love rikki, she was so sweet and nice and always smiling. and then I realized how  selfish and dumb she was. I hate sounding like a bitch but I' m starting with the  people I like the least and working my way to the good ones. ok so rikki, sweet girl,  adorable, but so dumb. and she's best friends with hillary, who I'll come back to  later, but it annoys me because hillary's one of my best friends and I hate how  much time they spend together. I'm not jealous, I just know that hillary could do so  much better than rikki, but rikki seems to need hillary. and I feel bad for hill  because a lot of people don't like rikki, and so they're always talking about her and  then people assume that because hill is so close with her that she sucks too,  which is so not true. but I've known rikki since junior high. ok now on to sarah  salon. I used to hate sarah. she's a bitch. not kidding. and she's intimidating as  hell, but only if you take her seriously. now I like her a lot more because I'm not  scared of her and I don't take her shit. she has two older sisters who might be the  meanest people ever, and she tries to act like them but she's so much better than  them. sarah had a boyfriend for a really long time, and so her and I were always  able to have really great conversations about boiyfriends and relationships. she's  always so much fun to be around. I like her. but her and rikki had this whole feud  going for a while and all she would do was talk about rikki and how much she  hated her. I'm wondering if this timing thing is accurate because I really feel like  I've been doing this forever and every time I'm typing, it seems like the seconds  don't go by, but every time I pause, the seconds go by quickly. maybe it's in my  head, I don't know. but it's weird. I'm going to start looking at another clock to see  how much time has gone by. ok after sarah, I only have favorites left. everyone  else left, I genuinely love, they're my best friends. I'll start with lizzie albert. Elizabeth Chandler Albert. I met lizzie freshman year and we were instantly best  friends. I'm not kidding, I loved her so much and we could always talk about  anything and laughed so much together it was ridiculous. and we were always on  the same intellectual level because we were pretty much the same (but she was  smarter). in our group of friends, we were the smartest. we were bff, I swear and  then junior year, our friends kind of got in this fight and we didn't talk for a really  long time. it really bothered me. I'm not joking. it killed me that she didn't want to  talk to me and I didn't understand. it was so bad. we were never the same again. but at the end of senior year, we got close again, and now I think we're really  close, like reverting back to three years ago. I miss her so much, she goes to  wisconsin. she's probably having the best time. I can't wait to go visit her. she's so  funny, I always have a great time whenever I'm with her. Love her. ok after lizzie  comes simone. I met simone actually a long time ago. Maybe in 1997. she came  to camp and we were good friends, we were in the same cabin. then she stopped  going to camp and I didn't see her again until I was in high school. then we  became best friends. I LOVE simone. she cracks me up and is so great. we finish  each other's sentences, she reminds me of my mom so much, she's like another  sister to me. we took this class together called 20th century history and literature,  and it was the best class that I have ever taken. I'm so glad that we were able to be  in that class together. I hate sounding cheesy but it's true. there's no one I'd rather  be in 20th with than simone. simone's dad died the day before her 5th birthday,  and so she lives with her mom. she has two sisters, so the four girls are pretty  close. her mom works all the time so I feel like simone's ahead of all of us, she's  already an adult. she does things by herself and is really mature. love her. she  goes to bradley which is so good for her. I really hope she's happy. she rocks my  world. after simone comes marisa. LOVE marisa. we always knew each other but  weren't really friends until about sophomore year. then the end of junior year and  all of senior year we were like inseperable. we were best friends. me, simone,  lizzie and marisa were a foursome. she's so funny, so sweet, loooooves to talk. I  love her family and going over to her house because I always have a good time  when I'm there. marisa was the kid who was on the fast track, if you know what I  mean. she had sex when she was 12 or 13, had a cell phone before everyone,  never really had any rules. Which the exact opposite of me. but she's great and I  love her. she has parties and her house is always the one we go back to after  dances and stuff. marisa and I went to breakfast every Saturday morning of our  senior year. that makes me so sad that I don't get to do that anymore. she goes to  indiana, and she loves it. both her parents went there and loved it. her mom was  president of aephi there, so she won't have any problems getting into the sorority. marisa goes with the flow, she's not uptight or anal about much. she's actually  underrated anal but I won't tell anyone about that. love her. and last, I'll talk about  Hillary. I love her. I've known her since the early days at camp marimeta. she was  always the little girl that everybody loved. we didn't become friends until we were  older and then became like best friends junior and senior year. she' so great. I  honestly love her and miss her so much. she wanted to go here so badly and  didn't get in. Ass holes. but I don't think she would have come here anyways. I can  talk to hillary about everything. I love her. she goes to illinois. I can't wait to go visit  her. she's so fun and we'll have the best time partying, but I also can't wait to just  talk with her and lay on her bed. she's so funny and a great person to be with. we're very similar in a lot of ways and I just think that she's great. the first time I  came to visit texas she came with me. and we were on poms together. She was  even my big sister one year. I miss poms. and I miss hill, I need to call her actually  because I miss her so much. she's so cute and so talented. she's the best dancer  ever and she has a really great voice but she doesn't really sing anymore. sometimes I make her sing to me, but she doesn't sing for a lot of people. ok so  now that I only have about a minute left I can talk about adam. adam jeffrey silver. I  met the kid the first day of high school. I was like, damn he's hot. we were in like 3  classes together and our last names are close so we sat next to each other. we  exchanged phone numbers, he asked me to homecoming and we dated ever  since. he's my best friend in the entire world. he knows me better than even I know  myself and more than my sister knows me. he's so special to me and I know that  I'm in love with him and that I will always love him. I miss him so much. sometimes  I don't' know what to do with myself because I miss him so much but I know it's the  right thing to be with other people right now. how else are we supposed to know if  we're really right for each other? this is the time to find out , you know? well, it's  been great. see you later",0
"Right now I'm a little bit depressed, not much has gone my way this week. I made some fabulous friends last week and we were all planning on going home together tomorrow, but now they seem not to want me to go with them. I don't know why everyone is getting mad all of the sudden, maybe it's something in the air. quite ridiculous, if you ask me. I have tears in my eyes as I'm typing, which is strange because I have tried so hard to not let little things get to me. My mom has always told me that I was overly sensitive, I thought I could overcome it, I think I can overcome anything. I had Mono a few years ago, and I overcame that one. My mind has not been forced to think in a while, people that I've talked to are just not to stimulating, I guess I should go and hang out in a coffee shop or something. I always thought college was going to be so much fun, and it's really not. I am this close to packing my bags and going home. Last week, I was the stereotypical college student and now, definitely not. My roommate and I are just not compatible, I mean she's a nice girl and all and she has good intentions, but I find her incredibly dull and childlike. She is a sophomore and I am a freshman. She has a really low self esteem and that's something that I don't deal well with, because I used to too. I don't like to think about those times, because I've overcome them. I fear that she is what I will become and it makes me resent her a bit. I don't want to live the life, or lack thereof, that she is leading. I make my life incredibly competitive, and I like to win. My cousin is down here, she rushed, she's actually in this class. But we've competed with each other all of our lives, whether the other one realized it or not, driving home, getting ready, meeting guys, they were all competitions. She and I are both incredibly stubborn too, so we butt heads quite often. I know that I've changed this year, and she has too, but we've changed differently. She's become more and more dependent on people, she can't be alone at all and I've become more and more independent of folks, for instance tonight, I walked over to the turtle pond and fed the fish, Carrie would freak out if someone told her to do that alone, but I really enjoyed myself tonight, I haven't felt that quiet peace in a long time down here. I don't know if UT is the right place for me, and I don't know. This is ridiculous. I'm here, and I'll graduate from here. Is this the sort of paper you're looking for? My mind is definitely not in a deep ponderous mood. This his how my mind works, worry after worry. I'd rather not get too far into myself here, if that's alright. On a happy note, I saw a guy in my Philosophy class today with absolutely Amazing hair. It was bleach blond and had four inch spikes! I admire people being gutsy enough to do that, never in my life would my hair be in spikes or fuchsia, I'll just stay the way I am. I miss my dog. I talked on the phone to my parents last night and I heard her bark in the background. I am ready to go home that's pretty much what has gotten me through this week. It has been the first time that I've gotten homesick. I think it's because I am going home tomorrow. Before, I didn't get homesick because I didn't allow myself to think about it too much, but I saw a Dallas Morning News today and got all choked up. What is all of this about anyway? Where do I benefit in the long run of living with someone I don't like and being forced to eat bad food? I'd much rather be in my own apartment. HA! My folks would really go for that one. They are so overprotective. The people that I was originally going home with are going to the Dave Matthews concert, and my mom won't let me go, I'm also not allowed to go to the TX v. OU game. That is stinky! I just need a good cry and a good nap and a hug from my grandma and everything will be fabulous again. I swear! If my roommate asks one more time if I want to talk about anything that's bothering me I will scream. I told her already that I'm writing a paper and she is still jabbering. Okay, Deep Breath. Back to Grandma. She is the cutest old lady in the entire world. She is definitely a cookiecutter grandma. It's fabulous. I told her I was coming home and she got so excited! My twenty minutes are up, but I feel much better now, I'm glad I got to take all of my emotion out on this essay rather than on my roommate! I don't know quite how to end my thoughts, even though I am 99. 99% sure that no one will ever read this.",0
"I hope that this isn't a big deal, as I have to write for 20 minutes in a completely random manner. If I get graded on content or grammar, I'm simply done now. I've been caring a lot about my grades so far and I'm going to need to keep it up to get into law school at someplace like Georgetown or Columbia. I actually miss NYC a lot, but its a nice change down here and I'm happy to get out of Connecticut. I do miss my family a little, but I think they are doing fine and I'll be seeing them in no time. I'm glad my dad is going to be at the lacrosse tournament in Vegas come October. Still can't believe we lost in the state semi's to crappy Amity. That one kid was really good though. Maybe playing at UT will be just as fun and we'll have success. Seems like Texas lacrosse is nothing to ours, but I shouldn't get cocky yet. Its only a club team. Nobody better come in my room even though the door is open. Don't feel like being social, and its late. Its annoying that dumb Mark always locks it too every single time one of us is out of the room for five seconds. In fact, Mark is annoying in general. He seemed fine when we talked online prior to coming here, but he reminds me of Mendelson at home so much. I don't do well with these leech people too, I wish he wouldn't follow me around. But you know what, he is a really nice kid and I feel terrible saying these things, especially in some assignment that someone is reading. At least I'm nice to him in person. Waking up to him puking this morning was not cool either. ah he is awake, he better not get up here and read the screen like he always does. bah. Its funny coming to college after you're used to your friends at home. I'm glad that I don't know anyone and I'm on my own. You get to the point where you expect things of people and you know your friends so well, so coming here puts you out of your element for a bit. I think I'm meeting decent people though and I only expect to meet more and more cool people. At first I was pretty skeptical about everyone, but that's just because I was missing the guys I've had a good time with for years. Time to move on. plus I always said I needed to get out of little lame Brookfield. Zebrahead is the bomb. I don't think I ever get tired of their music. I'd like to see them in concert again sometime soon but they don't really have any dates posted. And IF I do see them again, I'm going to chill towards the back and just listen. Being up front was crazy, but its hard to enjoy sometimes when you have some annoying girl giving you elbows to the kidneys and her nappy sweaty weave is sticking to your clothes and skin. But hey, its the price you pay I suppose. Radio 104 fest was still probably the most fun of all concerts though, hahahahh especially when we dropped that girl that was crowd surfing and kicking people in the faces on purpose and she started bleeding. Its horrible I know, but its really not cool what she was doing. Plus, she was not seriously injured. girls shouldn't crowd surf anyways, there are too many dirtbag guys who are just trying to crop a feel. HAHA Like that one guy who ripped the girl's thong off. Speaking of which, I need to meet some more girls here. Emily has completely drained me over the past two years and I'm glad that I can finally be away from her and her attachment and be able to meet some people. I do like that one girl in astronomy, she seems pretty cool. Its too bad I don't see much potential in meeting anyone on or around my floor, they are all pretty private. I don't see what Tyler and Jeremy and Luke see in the girls upstairs too, they're just really loud and annoying, and not the most attractive of ladies either. You got to love UT, there are attractive girls everywhere. AHAHAH To whoever is reading this, I apologize for sounding like a complete jackass. I've talked about dropping girls on their heads, and how I think people are ugly, and how I don't think people are too cool, and how Texas lacrosse isn't very good. I probably sound like one arrogant loser. I'm really not. but I do admit that I am very confident in myself, and I think that rubs off on how I express myself. Actually, I'm probably just pretty arrogant. 311 is the best. Again, the playlist is sidetracking my thoughts. I wish I went to see them in concert here last week, but I've seen them before and I had class early the next day. Live music is the best. I think seeing STP and Cake here the first night I visited put a pretty positive spin on the place for me, that was pretty tight. There's a whole lot to do here, I love it. Last night at Sixth Street was pretty fun too even. Everything just seems cool here. I'm drawing a blank here. just listening to music. Maybe I should I have left it off when I started writing. yep drawing a blank again. Wonder if Cameron is back at his ghetto dorm yet, he is going to have to start writing this too, and I bet I'll have mine finished by the time he even gets back in his room. Okay, my 20 minutes are up, and I could continue if I wanted to, but I'm pretty tired so I think it would be best for me to just hit the sack, or play Counter Strike.",0
"  Here is a possible essay on why math is a required subject and why it is so important:  Mathematics is the science of structure, order, and relation that has evolved from elemental practices of counting, measuring, and describing the shapes of objects1. It deals with logical reasoning and quantitative calculation, and its development has involved an increasing degree of idealization and abstraction of its subject matter1. Mathematics is not only an important subject in school, but also a vital skill for everyday life. In this essay, I will explain some of the benefits of learning math and how it can improve one’s quality of life.  One of the main reasons why math is important is that it promotes healthy brain function. Studies have shown that routinely practicing math keeps our brain healthy and functioning well2. Math challenges our brain to think critically, analytically, and creatively. It also enhances our memory, attention, and concentration. By doing math, we exercise our mental muscles and keep them sharp.  Another reason why math is important is that it improves problem-solving skills. Math teaches us how to approach problems systematically, logically, and rationally. It helps us develop strategies, methods, and algorithms to find solutions. It also trains us to check our work and verify our answers. These skills are useful not only for academic purposes, but also for personal and professional situations. For example, we can use math to plan a budget, manage our time, or troubleshoot a technical issue.  A third reason why math is important is that it opens up many opportunities for learning and career development. Math is the foundation of all sciences and helps us understand the world around us3. Math is essential in fields like engineering, physics, chemistry, biology, medicine, computer science, economics, and more. By learning math, we can explore various domains of knowledge and discover new things. Math also equips us with the tools and techniques to perform calculations, measurements, data analysis, modeling, simulation, and more. These abilities are in high demand in today’s society and can help us succeed in different professions.  In conclusion, math is a required subject because it is so important for our cognitive, practical, and educational development. Math enhances our brain function, improves our problem-solving skills, and opens up many opportunities for learning and career advancement. Math is not only a subject to be learned in school, but also a skill to be applied in life.   ",1
"I am a little irritated right now. I just did this thing for about 5 minutes and then my computer just like shut off!  I cannot believe I just spent those five minutes only to just have it all erased. Things like that irritate me a lot. I always just hate having done something and then it being useless. I guess that could be kind of an insecurity but yeah. I am not going to psychoanalyze myself. I guess since this is one of thise things that could do that for me. I wonder if this will get picked to be read. Probably not. Its getting done way early. I can't really see the reasoning behind the whole stream of consciousness thing. I mean yeah you can track your thoughts but couldn't you do that just by paying attention to yourself?  I dunno. just one of those things I guess. Moving on then. I'm eating a rice krispeys treat thing. I get hungry when I am irritated. I have to wonder how evolution made us that way. What is the point of eating when you are irritated. Shouldn't you want to do stuff?  that would make sense in the whole flight or fight mode sense kind of way. I am glad i have an apartment it doesn't smell here and the neighbors are really nice. Of course  you don't make a forced acquaintance like you would if you lived in a dorm I guess but this is more private and I can work on the bills and homework alone. Maybe I'll go out tonight with one of my new friends. I don't have plans and I'm not really interested in going to the game, as if I had the money to go anyways. Money is going to become an issue later. I should try and get a job this semester but i just don't want to get burnt out on my first semester. I don't really need the money but it would be nice in case of an emergency. And who doesn't like a little extra spending money?  I don't know i need to find somewhere close to work but i don't want to have to work as a cashier again. I hated doing that. Not as much as working as an area host(janitor) at a certain theme park. Not at all fond memories of the sausage shack and the bathrooms accompanying it around high noon. Its stupid how people have no real common sense when they go out to have fun. Honestly, who doesn't realize that a urinal is not made to be pooped in. It would hate to know the person who didn't understand what a urinal . URINal, is for its use is right there in the name c'mon people!  But yeah my lips are chapped really bad. I should find my chapstic otherwise I'll smile at someone and then make a weird face because I split my lip. Eminem is on now. Repeat of the MTv Movie Awards. He's not really a bad rapper assuming I can even even judge that music. But he honestly is about the whole shock value of his music probably. Just like many of his little fans. I have a really nice view of the septic area behind the aparmtments an dthe little balcony shows a wonderful scene of the vagrants coming out of the woods. I got that last part from a couple of my neighbors. The one seemed really witty, another was very . bubbly, and of course there was the one with a boyfriend. They are really nice I hope to get to know them more. Wow its almost time to stop the whole stream of consciousness. Just four more minutes. My nipples itch. I think its because of the new shirt I'm wearing. Wow that was kind of out there. You know what's funny assuming   you   were a person and could reply that is. I hope I don't become one of those people who just talks to themselves all the time.  But the funny thing is that I have a pencil sharpener in my room. Yet I only have mechanical pencils  That seems kind of pointless. Oh that is kind of punnish. I really need to find a book to read. I hate not having something immediate to do. Doing nothing is just not a strong suit. I miss my family now that I think about it. I think I'll give them a call today. I don't want them to think I don't care about them even though I'm away.",0
" Historically, there have been successful leaders who were both loved and feared. However, it is essential to consider the context and situation in which the leader operates. In some cases, being feared may be more effective, while in others, being loved may be the better approach.  Leaders who are feared often use intimidation, punishment, and the threat of consequences to maintain control over their subordinates. While this approach can be effective in the short term, it can also create a hostile work environment that can ultimately harm the organization's long-term success. Moreover, this type of leadership style can lead to a lack of trust and respect among the team members, which can negatively impact team morale, creativity, and productivity.  On the other hand, leaders who are loved often build a culture of trust, respect, and teamwork. They create a positive work environment by showing empathy, compassion, and concern for their team members. This approach often results in a more motivated and productive workforce, which can lead to higher levels of success for the organization in the long run.  In conclusion, the question of whether a leader should be loved or feared is not straightforward. Ultimately, the most effective leadership style will depend on the situation, the organization, and the people being led. A leader who can balance both approaches and adapt their leadership style to the situation will likely be the most successful.          ",1

" Music is an art form that transcends time, and as such, it is capable of resonating with people from different generations. The music that I grew up listening to may not be the same as what people from other generations enjoy, but that does not mean that it is not worth listening to. In fact, I believe that my generation's music is worth listening to, even if you are not from the same generation.  One of the reasons why I believe that my generation's music is worth listening to is because of the emotions that it conveys. Music has the power to make us feel things that we may not be able to express in words. The music of my generation speaks to the struggles and challenges that we face as young people trying to navigate a complex and ever-changing world. It addresses issues such as identity, social justice, and mental health, which are relevant not just to my generation but to everyone.  Another reason why my generation's music is worth listening to is that it represents a fusion of different genres and cultures. In today's globalized world, music has become more diverse and eclectic than ever before. My generation's music draws inspiration from various sources, including hip hop, R&B, rock, and electronic dance music. It also incorporates elements from different cultures, such as Latin, African, and Asian music. This diversity of influences makes the music of my generation both unique and exciting.  Finally, my generation's music is worth listening to because it is a reflection of the times we live in. Music has always been a reflection of society, and my generation's music is no different. It reflects the values, beliefs, and attitudes of young people today, who are more socially conscious, politically active, and open-minded than ever before. It is music that celebrates diversity, inclusivity, and equality, and that encourages us to be our best selves.  In conclusion, my generation's music is worth listening to because it speaks to the emotions, represents a fusion of different genres and cultures, and reflects the times we live in. It may not be the same as the music that people from other generations grew up listening to, but that does not mean that it is any less valuable or meaningful. So, I encourage you to give it a chance, and who knows, you might just discover a new favorite song or artist!         ",1
"I'm actually really tired, but I want to finish as much homework as I possibly can. It's not terribly late so I thought it would be nice to write something on my thoughts right before I go to bed. Today was a good day. Not too much stress and I talked to a lot of my friends and family. Its always nice when I get to talk to old friends from hs. today I met a girl that went to the same elementary as me. we didn't know each other, but we had a connection because we were from the same town. MOst people have never heard of my town before, so it was pretty cool. I also met a girl this morning that went to the other hs in my town, which again is strange. I actually met a lot of people, one of the girls has a class with me and we live right down the hall from each other. I'm glad to know that I have someone that I can study with or ask a question if I need help anytime I want. One good thing about college is that it's really easy to make friends. Even if you're a shy person, there's always someone who is willing to talk to you. I used to be really shy, but I don't have much of a problem introducing myself to random people, I actually enjoy doing that now. I look foward to those that I will meet tomorrow, I just hope I can remember everyone's name when I see them again. I've met so many people in such a short period of time that it becomes difficult to match names with faces. I enjoy all of my classes, I'm feeling pretty comfortable in my decision on what I plan to major in. It seems that I really do enjoy chemistry and biology, but I'm really glad to have a psychology class to take my mind off of things that I have to do. I'm really excited about Wednesday. I'm going to try out for the rowing team. I think I'm really going to enjoy the workouts and meeting new people. I hope I make the team, but I don't want to get my hopes up, so I'm just going to see how it goes. Today I went to the gym to see how difficult rowing really is and I feel much more comfortable with my decision. I was able to row correctly, although it gets kind of confusing at times because it is not a natural movement. but I was able to row for 2000 meters non-stop my first try, and I think that's pretty good because I only have to row for 500 meters for the tryouts. I'm not sure how good my chances are at making the team. I haven't been on a sports team since middle school. but I have been in band since sixth grade. band may not be the best workout ever or the most strenuous, but marching can get pretty tiring, and I think that it has prepared me a little for this. I'm really good with endurance which is key in rowing. In high school, we had to march for 8 minutes straight. my senior year I had a solo and I had to run around to my different sets and then stand still and play a long slow balad for a couple of minutes and make it musical. That was pretty hard to play without people realizing I'm completely out of breath. But it was really rewarding, I had the opportunity to play in front of thousands at a time at our football games. I could never get up in front of a crowd and speak or sing, but I can play my flute in front of anyone. I really wish I was able to be in the UT band. I had always wanted to be part of the band, but now my major doesn't allow the time. I hope that later in my college career, I have the chance to be in the marching band at least once. I think it would be so much fun. Music has always been a big thing in my life, I love to play it, but I also love to listen to it. My favorite kind of music is country. I especially love george strait. I have most of his cd's. I know every word to every song he sings, I only need to hear the first chord of one of his songs and I'll know its him. I'm also a big fan of 80's movies. one of my favorites is young frankenstein. mel brooks makes wonderful movies, I think they're all hilarious. real genius is another good one I like. most of my favorite movies I'm able to quote from beginning to end. one of the classics is the princess bride. there are so many great one-liners in that movie. my dad and I always say random quotes from movies anytime something happens. my dad knows the most trivial things. he'll know the answer to the most random question you can think of. its pointless, but its pretty cool. my dad and I are really close, I wish I could be more like my dad. we grew really close when my mom passed away when I was little, he remarried, and now I have a brother and a sister. I love my little sister so much, she's the cutest. she never uses my real name, she always calls me sister. I really miss her. but I talk to her often and she's always so excited to hear from me. she just got a new rabit, she's had 5 and three of them were sold in the stock show and one of them died. but now she has 2. I hope the heat doesn't get to these two like the others. she's always really worried about them. she also has a dog, and I have a dog named princess. my dog is a choc. lab. she's really cute, but she's also really old. I'm glad she has a new puppy to play with since I won't be there for her all the time. I've had her ever since I was little, I miss her too. I brought a lot of pictures and things from home so I wouldn't get homesick. my room is very comforting I think. I don't think I could stand it if it were blank. most of my pictures are of my family and of my best friend kelly. she goes to corpus with my brother, so she isn't that far away from me. we talk all the time online though, so it feels like she's here.",0
"I miss my guitar. I wish that I had brought one of them with me. I have to be sure to bring my amp and at least one guitar, maybe two of them back from home this weekend. That kind of sucks though, that I let mom borrow the one I really want to bring with me. I am glad though that she taking lessons. Maybe I could teach her some Metallica. I hope she helps Erin pay for that car she wants. But Erin also wants to get it repainted, because she just doesn't like the color. Oh well, I'm glad Erin is getting that car, BMW's are real safe. I should know, I've totaled enough of them. That scares me though, because kids have wrecks, and I've already lost a cousin, I don't know what I would do if I lost my sister. At least they're safe cars. I hope I can get a car for Christmas. I know I totaled a bunch of cars, but I was also an addict when I was in all of those wrecks, and I'm better now, it could be a reward. My doctor is really proud of me. When I told him that I had been clean for 101 days, he was very proud and said that ""a lot of times adults can't even do that, so you must be an adult. "" I was happy about that. I just wish that my dad was as proud, and understanding of how hard this is, and what a real accomplishment this is.",0
" Thomas Edison's statement suggests that genius is not just about having great ideas or inspiration, but it is more about the hard work and effort put into bringing those ideas to fruition. In other words, Edison emphasizes that successful outcomes require a great deal of work and persistence, not just talent or inspiration.  While it is true that hard work and persistence are essential for achieving success, it is also important to acknowledge that creativity and inspiration are equally crucial. Great ideas and innovative solutions come from inspiration, imagination, and a different perspective on things, which are not necessarily a result of hard work alone.  Therefore, while Thomas Edison's statement highlights the importance of hard work in achieving success, it should not undermine the value of creativity, imagination, and innovation in the process. Both elements are essential in achieving great results, and they complement each other to bring about exceptional outcomes.      ",1
"Well this is it , I guess?  My first writing assignment in Psychology. I sure hope that no one calls and interrupts my internet access. Watch!  Now that I've said that, someone will probably call. I'm the type of person that thinks that way. I mean, that if I say that I don't want something to happen, then I think that it probably will. The thing is, that those negative things that I think will happen seldom do. I guess I am just a cynical person like that. Wait, is that cynical or pessimistic?  I don't know!  Maybe I just think that way because I think it's humorous, or maybe I'm just trying to keep myself in check. Whatever it is, I just think that way sometimes. Enough about that. There sure are a lot  of fine women here at UT. Well. Maybe it's because I went to an all boy school for four years that I think that way. No, that's not it. These girls would look good regardless of where I went to high school. The good thing is that there are a lot of girls, the bad thing is that I havent met one yet. I have always been shy around girls and going to an all-boy high school didn't help anything. Well, I will say it right here!  I am going to do my best to get over that. With all these girls, I just can't let them pass me by. I see how happy my roommate and friend is with his girlfriend. I also hear countless stories of all these ""fine"" girls that he has met. I want to be the one with the stories and the girl. Not that I want  my friend to not have the stories and the girl, but I want those things, too. Heartbreaking story:  there is this real ""fly"" Asian girl in my Chemistry class. On the first day, she sat right next to me!  Then I don't see here for a couple of days. Today I see her, finally!  And she's holding some dude's hand!  Oh well, I guess?!? There's an addiction that I must get over. Not drugs, or alcohol, or anything bad like that. You see, I love to play at the local arcade. I must spend about two dollars every other day in there. My money isn't limitless and everytime I put a quarter into the arcade machine, then that's one less load of laundry that I can do. Now do I want 20 minutes of entertainment or clean clothes. I don't know. It seems that every free moment I have I am in that stupid arcade. A tie-in with the last paragraph: maybe I don't meet any girls because I am in the arcade all the time. Prediction:  I get out of the arcade, I take on an outgoing attitude, and I will meet a girl. Before I finish with this writing assignment, let me tell you about the two addictions that I have that I don't really care to get rid of. I love the Simpsons, and hip-hop. There's something about both of those that I just find pure joy in. In both cases, I see, here, and enjoy things that most people don't. It seems that the more obscure or ""hidden"" the things that I find enjoyment, the more joy I find in it. I guess it's that I am such a fan of both that the ordinary just isn't quite good enough. That's sort of bad. I should just enjoy the Simpsons and hip-hop for what they are and stop looking for the obscure. Well, this wasnt so bad. With this  being the first assignment, I guess I'll see you( the psychology web-page) tomorrow .",0
" History is often seen as a dry, boring subject by many students, who may wonder why they need to learn about events that happened long ago. However, a deeper look into the study of history reveals that it is an essential part of our education and understanding of the world around us. In this essay, I will explain why learning about the past is important and why it should not be dismissed as irrelevant.  Firstly, history provides us with a sense of identity and belonging. By learning about the past, we can understand the roots of our cultural heritage and the evolution of our societies. We can also appreciate the contributions of our ancestors and the struggles they faced, which have shaped our modern world. Without an understanding of our past, we cannot fully understand ourselves or the world we live in.  Secondly, history teaches us valuable lessons that can be applied to our present and future. By examining past events, we can learn from the successes and failures of our predecessors and make more informed decisions in the present. We can also develop a better understanding of the consequences of our actions and the impact they may have on future generations. For example, the study of past pandemics can help us to prepare for and prevent future outbreaks.  Thirdly, history helps us to develop critical thinking skills. By examining multiple perspectives and sources, we can learn to evaluate evidence, identify biases, and form our own opinions. This is particularly important in today's world, where fake news and misinformation are prevalent. A strong understanding of history can help us to discern truth from fiction and make informed decisions based on reliable information.  Finally, history provides us with a sense of continuity and context. By understanding the past, we can appreciate how the world has evolved and how different events and ideas are connected. We can also understand how our current problems and challenges have roots in the past and how they have been addressed by previous generations. This can provide us with a sense of hope and resilience, knowing that we are part of a larger story and that we can learn from the struggles of those who came before us.  In conclusion, learning about history is essential for a well-rounded education and a deeper understanding of the world around us. It provides us with a sense of identity, teaches us valuable lessons, develops critical thinking skills, and provides us with a sense of continuity and context. While it may not always be the most exciting subject, it is certainly one of the most important, and students should approach it with an open mind and a willingness to learn.  ",1
"It is really bright in here. Maybe I should turn on of the lights off. I would except I'm writing a stream of consciousness. I really miss Byron. I just talked to him about 10 minutes ago, but I need to talk to him again. Boy, is my cell phone bill going to be high this month. Haha. I still haven't paid mom for last months bill. I probably should have read chapter 3 before starting this, since it is due tomorrow and this isn't due until the 12th, but I would more than likely had waiting until the last minute if I hadn't gotten this over now. Whoops. My poster looks like it is about to fall down. Oh well, I'm to tired to go and put it back up. Yet, I am still awake enough to sit here and type for 20 minutes. I wonder how much people write for this if they are slow typers. And I wonder if they read every one of these. Especially since mine is going to be so long because of my typing speed. Man, if I were a slow typer this would be a lot less work. And if I wasn't so diligent about punctuation, capitalization, and spelling. Haha. Instead of spelling I accidentally wrote sleeping and had to erase it. I wonder if that is my subconscious trying to tell me something. I'm so glad I finished that photo wall. It turned out really nice, but Stephanie didn't seem to like it too much because she didn't have quite as many pictures as I did to put up. Oh well, that's her problem. Man, my DVD's are really out of order. I'm not sure why I think they need to be in any order at all, because in the grand scheme of things, that really doesn't matter quite that much. You know what would really suck would be if my computer, out of the blue caught a virus while I was in the middle of this, and I would have to start all over again. Then I would just wait until the last minute and probably not type quite so much. Oh well, this is for science I guess. Man I really really miss Byron. I can't believe I got so upset today when I was driving home, but what can you do when you love somebody so much. I don't know how his brother is related to him, he is so strange. At least he is nice I guess. I wonder if his blindness was caused from his genes or from some other problem when he was born. I guess that really isn't my business, but I'm just so damn curious. Byron didn't seem to know, so I guess I'll never find out unless I ask him, and I don't know him quite well enough to do that. Man, my pinky is really starting to cramp up. I don't think I've written for 8 minutes straight before without taking a break. I hope my Calculus quiz tomorrow isn't bad, I did the homework and everything and my professor swears that it is enough preparation for his quizzes, but yet I still remain cynical. I guess I'll just go over the homework problems again before I go to sleep. I can't wait until that Royal's show comes on A and E. Wow, I was so lazy I didn't even bother to find the and symbol. Haha. I did it again. If I wasn't on this laptop I wouldn't have a problem finding it. I wish it came with a 10 key pad. Byron. Byron. I can't stop thinking about that boy. He is such a sweet heart, and I can't wait to finish college so I can spend all my time with him. I wonder where A & E is. Haha. I found the & symbol. I wonder if there is some way that I can find out the channels on the internet through UT's website. Man this is a hell of a lot of typing. Hey hey, I see my Monkees bobble heads. They are so strangely entertaining. That's the only reason why I'm going to watch the A&E special, (davy jones is on it wahoo). That, and because Byron said he was going to watch it. There's the picture I have of us!  I can't stop looking at it or thinking about him!  I'm sure whoever (if anyone) reads this will wonder who Byron is (though it's pretty obvious). I hope Archie allows him to stay over at his dorm so he can come visit next weekend, and I don't have to drive back to San Antonio again. I don't mind driving down there, it might just be nice to have a change of scenery and have Byron visit up here. I'm going to be so worried about him though because he has to wait until he gets off of work to drive up here. There are to many drunk people out on the street for him to be safe, even though I trust his driving abilities. I think I'll have him call periodically on his way up here, just so I know that he is alright. Ya, that's a good idea. I should probably go and put those batteries into my remote but I don't want to get up and find it, nor am I suppose to get up from this typing and do something else. Man, Steph drank all my Hi-C. Or did I drink it all?  Naw. Steph did. I distinctly remember having at least 2 left in there when I left on Thursday. I don't drink her stuff. Oh wait, I did but she told me I could have some. Man, that whip cream I got on my face earlier from the Frappacino still hasn't come off after washing my face twice. I can still smell it. Eww. It smells like babies vomit. Byron!  Why aren't you here with me right now!  I know why you aren't here, but I wish you were!  Someday I won't have to worry about where you are all the time, and wonder what you are doing, but for right now this is torture!  Especially since I am writing all my thoughts down, and these thoughts of you are more obvious to me than normal!  All the thought I have in-between are meaningless because I don't consciously notice them, but when I'm thinking about you it takes all my concentration and full attention!  I should probably try and not think about missing you during class, but I can't stop. IT isn't like I don't mind these ideas, I just know that I won't be paying attention to what I should be. Hurray I'm almost out of time. 19 minutes. and a few seconds. Steph needs to put her stuff away and keep it away from my side of room. What is up with this. I'm not going to clean up after her. I'm getting so annoyed with her sleeping habits, but what can I do. I love you Byron!  I want to drive up there right now but I can't because of class!",0

"The library is so boring. I can't stand more than two hours of library a day. Daily discussion sections can be really useless in the long run for easy classes, one would be better off studying. It is hard to write a stream of consciousness when typing and especially being in a library with other people around you. There are too many distractions and I believe this particular writing assignment to be more effective on my behalf in a different environment. Time is tricky in that it seems to move by faster than expected when it is divided into units, I divide my day into units of time rather than just saying that I have to be in class for an hour, i consider this one unit of time and everything just works out as planned. I wonder if people have a preference on which computer to use when they enter a computer lab, I mean location of the computer, I have a preference for the computers in the back corner or at least at the end of the row. I have am uncomfortable with people sitting behind me or even next to me when there is a chance I may be watched. I am not really following the rules of stream of consciousness because i am using punctuation marks and there is no real stream with punctuation marks. It is hard not to, may be there is something psychologically wrong with a person who  uses punctuation in a stream of consciousness one thing is for certain is that the person may be a little occupied by trivial matters. a beautiful girl just walked in so she is on my mind so since she is on my mind i will write about her, she is wearing a black dress, knee high and a tan beld with tan shoes, i wonder why she dressed like that to go to the library and use a computer, awesome she is now sitting at the computer next to me if i wasnt in a stream on consciousness may be i would talk to her, probably not i am not good with those type of situations anyway, i guess i shouldnt write about her when she may glance over and see my writing about her enough of that, where was i in my original thoughts before this incident occured, i believe i was talking about time and how controlling it can be when dealt with in the wrong way our whole society is so structured on this intangible object its amazing when you dwell and also can get confusing. i think i may just move to spain where time is not that big of a deal, at least thats what my high school sociology teacher told me, she was an attractive lady who had just got out of college and she really liked me, not in a sexual way, she had a wonderful family, and her child was very beautiful, i hope one day i may have the chance to have such a nice child. anyway, our relationship was good, she even invited me to the movies and many dinners at her house, it was awkward, but  i soon became kind of close with that family, she knew my mother was living in austin and wanted to just kind of have the experience of a teenage son i guess i recall those two years and i feel extremely happy and encouraged by that woman and she helped me deal with not having a mother",0

" Living on a budget means carefully managing your income and expenses to ensure that you are living within your means and not accumulating additional debt. If you have a great many debts, creating and sticking to a budget can be a crucial step towards improving your financial situation.  To begin with, you will need to take a close look at your income and expenses. Make a list of all your debts, including the amount owed, interest rates, and minimum payments required. Next, track all of your income sources and expenses over a period of at least one month. This will give you a better understanding of where your money is going and where you may be able to cut back.  Once you have a clear picture of your financial situation, it's time to create a budget. Start by prioritizing your debts and making sure to make at least the minimum payments on each one. Consider creating a debt repayment plan that prioritizes the highest interest debts first, as these will cost you the most in the long run.  Next, identify areas where you can reduce your expenses. This could include cutting back on dining out or entertainment, canceling subscription services, or finding ways to save on groceries and utilities. Look for ways to increase your income as well, such as taking on additional work or selling items you no longer need.  It's important to stick to your budget and make adjustments as needed. Avoid taking on new debt unless absolutely necessary, and make a habit of saving a portion of your income each month. Over time, as you pay down your debts and improve your financial situation, you can gradually adjust your budget and increase your savings. Remember, living on a budget is about making responsible choices and being mindful of your spending habits, and it can be a powerful tool for achieving financial stability and long-term success.

Well actually I do it's because I'm in this FIG and that is pretty cool. It helps a lot. I don't know what exactly I'm supposed to write but I'm trying to just keep going. I know that I am happy today because my girl friend Ginger is coming to town and I haven't seen her in a week. That also includes my mother. I really miss her and I know that she is lonely. I also miss my brother and sister and even my dad. I wish I could play video games and party with my brother like we used to before I left. Speaking of partying I haven't done any of that since I came to Austin which is supposedly this huge party city. I think the reason that I haven't partied is because I have not been able to meet many guys here yet and that is usually who I go party with. I also miss my party pals from Arlington they weren't my best friends but they were a blast to go party with. I wonder how they are doing right now. I think they are probably skipping class for no reason, again. I don't know why you would skip class in high school it just gets you into too much trouble. I never got in trouble in high school until the last day when me and a lot of senior guys rode our bikes up to school and then through the school. That got us Dhall, but it was worth it because the bike thing was really fun. In fact all of high school was really fun except  no all of it was fun. It was easy there was always a party and I had a group of good friends to hang out with which made it even better. Those kids who are still there do not know how lucky they are to still be there. I mean I love college and everything but it is just way different. And living by yourself isn't all its cracked up to be. I mean I have to clean my room, do my own laundry, and stuff like that. I also think that I had good morals installed in me because I feel really bad when I party in my room, which I thought I would do all of the time. But I guess that also has to do with my roommate. He is just fresh in from India and is not that accustomed to living in America yet. But he is a lot cooler than I thought he was once I sat down and talked to him. I guess if you give people a chance most of them come through, except for the real jerks. I am listening to Prodigy right now and it is really fun to listen to I fell like writing down what it sounds like but since it is techno it would broadly be difficult for me to accomplish that. I wish that I had the musical talent and equipment to do something like that, but I have neither the time or musical capacity to really do that.",0
"Well writing really isn't my best ior favorite thing to do but i guess it doesn't matter when you are paying to take your classe huh??? anyway when i write i seem to easily get destracted and then it just makes the time go by alot slower whicch in turn makes it really boring. Well that is why i don't like writtin and when i first heard that we were going to have to do it for twenty minutes i felt sick to my stomach. well enough of that next. . . Lets see. . are you sure that this is confidential,  well if it is then i guess it is ok, i mean this is UT (the greatest school in the world),me and my girlfriend have our anniversary tonight, we have been together for two years as of today. that is the longest that i have ever been with someone, i guess i can talk about my girlfriend because she is the only thing that i can talk about for 20 minutes,  or at least i hope that i can. well in june of 2000 this girl called me and asked how i was. ididn't recognize her voice so i was trying to play it off until she gave me a clue as to who she was. Then she asked how my summer was going and i said fine and asked her the same thing. Then she asked me if i was running like coach told us to do over the summer, so then i knew that she was a track girl. I then could eliminate quite a few considdering that most of the track girls were gorgeuos(&lt;--spelling) and probably wouldn't have anything to do with me. You see i have alot of piopular friend, i mean played football and ran track for 6 years all the way from seventh grade to my senior year. Now i was never REALLY good at either one but i could hold my own, but i guess since i wasn't one of the star ath;etes that i was not very popular in turn myself. So, bvack to the story which hopfully makes this writing alot easier. So i had narrowed it down to about five and then she told me that she got my number from her yearbook that i signed, and i onlyremember signing one girls yearbook on the track team. So i gave it a shot aand asked her   so what about you Rebecca are you running?    she answered yes and then i knew thatr it was her. Now Rebecca is just like me very athletic and have alot of friends that are popular but we are not popular our-selves. so we talked for a while and then i had to go because i was going to eat dinner. so she called me a couple of days later and saying that her and her b/f weren't getting along becase he was in corpus cristi at a tennis camp ((what a geeeeeeeeeeek)  but i guess that i am a geek also)and would never talk to her. so, to make a long story short, they broke up and then on september 12, 2000 is when we officially started to be together and here we are today the rest is just history but honestly i am not the type of guy who thinks about love at first sight and knowing that you want to spend the rest of your liofe with someone but i reall do love her and i can't really see myself without her and she has told me the same. Man is thing almost ove, oh it is well thanks for listining",0

"  On the one hand, computer communication can help shy people express themselves more freely and confidently, as they have more time to think about what they want to say and can revise their messages before sending them. This can be especially beneficial in work settings, where people may need to communicate with colleagues or clients they have never met in person.  On the other hand, relying too much on computer communication can hinder our ability to develop interpersonal skills and form meaningful relationships. For example, when we communicate in person, we can pick up on nonverbal cues such as tone of voice, facial expressions, and body language, which can help us better understand the emotions and intentions of the other person. These nonverbal cues are often lost or misinterpreted in computer communication, which can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications.  Moreover, computer communication can be impersonal and isolating, as it lacks the warmth and intimacy of face-to-face interaction. When we communicate in person, we can share experiences and emotions more deeply, which can create stronger bonds and foster more meaningful relationships.  Therefore, I believe that computer communication can be a useful tool, but it should not be relied on exclusively. We should strive to balance our use of technology with face-to-face interaction, as this can help us develop interpersonal skills, build stronger relationships, and enhance our overall well-being.

"I went to my sorority's crush party last night. I didn't really know what to expect because they had it at Buffalo Club and I don't dance, I don't smoke, and I certainly don't look 21. At any rate, I wasn't having very much fun after 30 minutes. At that point a guy came up to me and asked me to dance, I figured it couldn't be any worse than standing around so I said yes. We ended up hanging around with each other the entire evening. We exchanged phone numbers and I kind of figured that was the end of it. It was about twelve-thirty when I drank half of my ""big sister's"" Long Island Iced Tea and I have to say I think that it really impaired my judgement. I got talked into going to Dance Across with three of my sorority sisters and the guy who had been hanging around me. I had fun, we danced, but he isn't exactly the kind of guy I'm particularly attracted to. For some reason I put that aside, became extremely flirtatious, and even let him French kiss me after having met him only four hours before. I feel really cheap now, I never do things like that. I don't really know what the reason for my actions was (I'm blaming it on the drink, but that's probably not the problem because the effects had worn off before the end of the evening). Maybe I'm somewhat lonely, it's been about three months since I've had a boyfriend. The problem is that I woke up this morning and regretted last night. I feel like I used this guy, I didn't mean to. Maybe it's not that I don't want a boyfriend, maybe it's that I don't want him as a boyfriend. The worst thing about this is that I've been in his position before (having someone kiss me than decide they don't want me, in fact, it was last week) but it hurt my feelings and I think it's extremely insensitive of me to do the same thing to someone else.",0
"Crap, I was half way through this assignment and my computer just cut out or something. I really hope it didn't already submit because I don't want to screw up my credit for this paper. Great, now I'm completely paranoid that I've managed to screw up something so simple. I'll keep my fingers crossed. I need all the help I can get to do well in this class. Actually, I haven't worried about my grades in a long time. When tests start, I'll panic. It's really hard to focus in my morning classes during lectures. I never get enough rest. My schedule's all out of order. I can't fall asleep until around two or three and then have to wake up at seven. I'm tired all day long. I hear my TV and want to go watch it. I always put stuff off and watch too much television. I have a problem with procrastinating. I never used to be this bad. I'm scared that since I can't get on a study plan, I'll fail. I hate it when I over use a word when I'm writing. I feel like I haven't written enough, but does length matter?  My birthday is next week, which somewhat depresses me. I'm not close to any of my friends, and I'm scared they're going to forget about me. I feel like the only loser out of my friends who's not having this great college experience. It's not that I'm homesick, just kind of restless and bored. I haven't met that many people and frankly, feel like an outcast. My head hurts, but I have no tylenol. I hate swallowing pills. I used to break them up and put them in yogurt. I'm such a wuss. My roommate went home for the afternoon. I'm glad she is gone. She can be a little much with the extreme cleanliness. I went out of town one weekend, and she made my bed. I don't really want her invading my space and touching my things.",0
" Conveniences are things that make our lives easier, more comfortable, or more enjoyable. They can be products, services, technologies, or practices that save us time, effort, money, or hassle. Conveniences have changed people's lives in many ways, both positive and negative. In this essay, I will discuss some of the impacts of conveniences on different aspects of human life, such as media, health, education, and social relationships.  One of the most obvious ways that conveniences have changed people's lives is through media and media consumption. Thanks to the internet, smartphones, streaming platforms, and social media, we have access to a vast amount of information and entertainment at our fingertips. We can watch movies and shows on demand, listen to music and podcasts, read books and articles, play games, and communicate with anyone around the world. According to the World Economic Forum[^1^][1], technology has radically transformed our societies and our daily lives since the dotcom bubble burst in 2000. Technology has also enabled new forms of media production and distribution, such as blogs, podcasts, YouTube videos, and online platforms for journalism and activism. These conveniences have given us more choices, opportunities, and empowerment as media consumers and producers.  However, conveniences also have some drawbacks when it comes to media and media consumption. For example, some people may become addicted to their devices and spend too much time online, neglecting their physical and mental health, their work or studies, and their social interactions. Some people may also become overwhelmed by the amount of information and entertainment available online and suffer from information overload or decision fatigue. Moreover, some people may be exposed to misinformation, propaganda, hate speech, cyberbullying, or other harmful content online that can affect their beliefs, attitudes, emotions, or behaviors. Additionally, some people may lose their critical thinking skills or their sense of reality when they rely too much on online sources or platforms for their information and opinions.  Another way that conveniences have changed people's lives is through health and healthcare. Thanks to advances in medicine, biotechnology, engineering, and artificial intelligence, we have access to better diagnosis, treatment, prevention, and cure of various diseases and conditions. We can also monitor our health using wearable devices or apps that track our vital signs, activity levels, sleep patterns, or nutrition. We can also order medicines or consult doctors online using telemedicine services. According to KARK[^2^][2], a life of convenience has allowed many people to enjoy longer and healthier lives.  However, conveniences also have some negative impacts on health and healthcare. For instance, some people may become lazy or sedentary when they rely too much on technology or services for their daily tasks or needs. Some people may also develop unhealthy habits or lifestyles when they consume too much fast food, processed food, alcohol, or drugs that are easily available or delivered to their doorsteps. Some people may also lose their natural immunity or resistance to diseases when they overuse antibiotics, vaccines, or supplements that are meant to protect them from infections or illnesses. Furthermore, some people may face ethical, legal, or social dilemmas when they use technologies or services that alter their genes, organs, or appearance for cosmetic, enhancement, or reproductive purposes.  A third way that conveniences have changed people's lives is through education and learning. Thanks to the internet, computers, tablets, and online platforms, we have access to a wide range of educational resources and opportunities at any time and place. We can learn new skills, languages, or subjects using online courses, tutorials, or videos. We can also obtain degrees or certificates from reputable institutions using online programs or platforms. According to Shauna Hart[^2^][2], a mother of three adult children who completed a degree online, technology has opened a lot more doors for education and learning that would not have been possible otherwise.  However, conveniences also have some challenges when it comes to education and learning. For example, some people may lack the motivation, discipline, or self-regulation skills to complete their online courses or programs successfully. Some people may also cheat or plagiarize when they use online sources or tools for their assignments or exams. Moreover, some people may miss out on the social, emotional, or cultural aspects of education and learning when they study online without interacting with their teachers or peers face-to-face. Additionally, some people may face difficulties in finding jobs or recognition when they use online degrees or certificates that are not accredited or accepted by employers or institutions. ",1
" There are many ways to save money and still cover your basic needs. Here are some suggestions:  Create a budget: Start by listing all of your expenses and income for the month. Then, prioritize your basic needs such as rent, utilities, food, and transportation. Allocate your remaining funds towards other expenses like entertainment or shopping. Stick to this budget strictly.  Cook at home: Eating out can be expensive. By preparing meals at home, you can save a lot of money. Buy groceries in bulk and cook in batches to save time and money.  Reduce utility bills: Unplug unused appliances, turn off lights and adjust the thermostat. These small changes can significantly reduce your utility bills.  Shop smart: Buy generic brands and shop at discount stores. Purchase only the things that you need and avoid impulse buys.  Use public transportation: Take public transportation instead of owning a car. It’s cheaper and can save you money on gas, maintenance, and insurance.  Reduce unnecessary expenses: Eliminate subscriptions you don’t use, cancel memberships, and avoid expensive hobbies or vacations.  Find ways to earn extra money: Consider taking up a side hustle or selling unused items online. Use the extra money to cover unexpected expenses or put it towards savings.  By implementing these strategies, you can save money while still covering your basic needs. It takes discipline and consistency, but the rewards can be significant.     ",1
"I am hoping that I will be able to keep up with my thoughts for twenty minutes. It is only 8:12 and I still have 20 minutes to go. I wonder if Jared is doing ok. I hope he ate. I was really happy to see him eat so much at lunch today. I hope I don't get in trouble for sitting with him in his cafeteria. Today was so hot. I am definatley wearing shorts tomorrow. But that shirt is dark red, I hope it won't absorb too much heat. I must have lost at least 10 lbs of water today. It is riduculous how bad my schedule is. One hour in class, the next three sitting somewhere. God, finding FAC is going to be my semester goal. I can't believe how hard it is to find that building. No one else has trouble finding it but me. Maybe I have some kind of direction learning disability. I wonder if I have missplelled any words. does misspell have a hyphen? My head hurts. I must be because I am tired. Maybe because I have had my hair pulled back all day. I hope I can find that building tomorrow before I go to class. I hope history isn't boring. With my luck it will be awful. An hour and a half contemplating how the Germans felt about this and that. Why did I sign up for that class. I am doing a pretty good job typing. I hope they didn't want this in a certain form. AOL is such a waste of money. I wonder if Jared got me into the draw. I hope so. I can't wait till the game on Saturday. It will be so much fun. I hope his roomate likes me. I felt weird today just sitting there. I need to make some friends. My head hurts so badly. I need to go to bed early tonight. I don't have to get up half as early tomorrow as I did today. I think we are going to have to find a better way of comunicating. I was almost in tears when I couldn't find him. I wonder if he was mad at me. I hope not. I wish he would show more interest in me. Hopefully it is just because school started today. I guess they call it class and not school. I really didn't feel overwhelmed today. I am so tired. Only ten more minutes. I feel like I am writing a letter. I wonder how Casey and Anh are doing. I haven't heard from Lauren in about four months. She can be ridiculous when she wants to be. I wonder if she thinks I moved? I hope she doesn't come here for college. i know I would have to be her room mate and everything I did would be reported to everybody and their brother. I wonder why I have been using ""everybody and their dog"" latley. Perhaps no one has heard and their brother, so I feel weird saying it. I was really amazed that I got that great spot in the garage today. I think it was the same one that I parked in last night. I felt really bad for using the elevator to go up one level, but my hip was hurting terribly. It better go away for tomorrow. I hope I didn't miss a class today. All these discussion classes are going to drive me insane. Life would be much easier if I had a decent schedule. i think she is going deaf. Between the two of them, my God. She has been edgy lately. There can't be much stress doing what she does. What would happen if she saw this. I wonder if she would get upset and yell. Probably. I can't wait till it gets cooler. Better yet, I can't wait till Christmas break. I wonder how many people at UT celebrate Christmas. I need to start shopping for presents. I need to wrap the gifts that I have. Caitlin's birthday is in A FEW DAYS. Where does the time go? I wonder if this rambling means I'm crazy? I wouldn't be surprised. I can stop now.",0
"  Watching TV is a common pastime for many people, especially in the evenings. It can be entertaining, informative, and relaxing. However, watching too much TV can also have negative effects on our health, well-being, and cognitive abilities. In this essay, I will argue that we should spend less time in front of the TV and more time engaging in other activities that are beneficial for our mind and body.  One of the main reasons why watching too much TV is bad for us is that it can increase our risk of developing various chronic diseases. According to a study by Johns Hopkins University1, excessive TV viewing can lead to reduced amounts of gray matter in the brain, which is responsible for mental processing. This can impair our memory, attention, and decision-making skills. Moreover, watching too much TV can also raise our blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugar levels, which can contribute to cardiovascular diseases and diabetes2. A study by Harvard Health3 found that people who watched more than four hours of TV a day had a 49% higher risk of heart attack, stroke, and death than those who watched less than two hours.  Another reason why watching too much TV is harmful is that it can disrupt our sleep patterns and quality. Sleep is essential for our physical and mental health, as it helps us repair our tissues, regulate our hormones, and consolidate our memories. However, watching TV before bed can interfere with our natural circadian rhythms and melatonin production, which are responsible for regulating our sleep-wake cycle2. The bright light and stimulating content of TV can also keep us awake and alert, making it harder to fall asleep and stay asleep. Lack of sleep can lead to fatigue, mood swings, impaired concentration, and lower immunity.  A third reason why watching too much TV is detrimental is that it can reduce our social interaction and engagement with the world. TV can be a source of entertainment and information, but it can also isolate us from our family, friends, and community. Watching TV can take away time and opportunities for meaningful conversations, shared activities, and emotional support. It can also limit our exposure to diverse perspectives, cultures, and experiences. Furthermore, watching too much TV can make us passive consumers of information and entertainment, rather than active participants in learning and creating. TV can also influence our attitudes, values, and behaviors in negative ways, such as promoting violence, stereotypes, consumerism, and unrealistic expectations.  Therefore, I believe that we should spend less time in front of the TV and more time doing other things that are good for our health and happiness. Some examples of alternative activities are:  Reading books or magazines that stimulate our imagination and curiosity. Playing games or puzzles that challenge our brain and improve our cognitive skills. Exercising or doing sports that strengthen our muscles and cardiovascular system. Meditating or doing yoga that relax our mind and body. Cooking or gardening that enhance our creativity and sensory awareness. Volunteering or joining clubs that expand our social network and contribute to society. By reducing our TV time and increasing our involvement in these activities, we can improve our physical and mental well-being, as well as enrich our lives with more joy and meaning.      ",1
"  The idea of banning passenger cars in cities with extensive public transportation systems is a controversial one, and there are valid arguments both in favor of and against it.  On the one hand, such a ban could greatly reduce air and noise pollution, as well as traffic congestion. By forcing people to rely on walking, biking, or public transportation, the number of cars on the road would decrease significantly, leading to improved air quality and reduced traffic noise. In addition, public transportation systems could become more efficient and reliable with fewer cars on the road, leading to faster and more convenient travel for commuters.  On the other hand, such a ban could have negative consequences for some individuals, particularly those who rely on cars for their livelihoods, such as taxi drivers and delivery personnel. Additionally, some people may find it difficult or inconvenient to rely solely on public transportation or active transportation modes like walking and biking. For example, individuals with disabilities or who live far from public transportation stops may find it challenging to get around.  Overall, a ban on passenger cars in cities with extensive public transportation systems could have significant benefits for the environment and traffic flow. However, it is important to consider the potential negative consequences for individuals who rely on cars for their livelihoods or find it difficult to rely solely on public transportation or active transportation modes. A more feasible approach may be to promote the use of public transportation and active transportation modes while still allowing for the use of passenger cars.  ",1
"tj just got home and made his coffee. It smells good. I should have made coffee instead of drinking 3 cupsof Earl Gray tea because after two cups I have to pee every 10 to 15 minutes. Is it going to flood again. Looks like it is going to rain more. Ihope the tropical depression doesnt stall causing flooding again. We were sooo close last Nov. Itis about time for a nap. all this reading to do toady. That has to be completed today. My school schedule sucks. My work schedule sucks. Added together = triple sucking. I have NO reading time. I need to settle mom's affairs to that I don't have towork this semester. Rick will help me if the probate isnt over. He is truely manic depressive. His birthday upsetting him so he bought his 57 inch TV and now after the New Orleans deseaster his new Mercedes. Could it be from his Zoloft that he is taking for his premeture ejaculation condition?  If your mental state is fine and you takean anti depressant for a medical condition (non mental), can that cause a mental condition itself?  Was he trueful with me on the ture purpose for taking Zoloft?  Or, is he a scheemer?  The plane flying over triggered my thought that I can't beleive that it has already been a year since that traumatizing pictures on TV of 9-11. I have to pee already but I can't since this is timed. But I need to really badly, now that I thought of it. Dinner. What shall I make?  Should I save my time and just order Pizza?  I hope that my wallet that was stolen in New orleans arrives Monday. I hope that the receipts that I need to return those books are still in it. I am soo thankful that there are still good, honest people left in this world and that one found my wallet. He said that there was no money in it but what other stuff that was in the bill compartment is still there. I need to send that guy something as a thank you for your trouble to send it back to me. What should I send him?  Money for the acutal cost of sending my wallet to me and maybe a gift certificate, but from where?  I was soooo careful, making sure that my back pocket was buttoned at ALL times, almost like an obsession - constantly checking the button. Leson learned though, don't have your , never mind, strangers shouldn't have to read that thought. I hope nothing is wrong with my niece. I hope that she is not upset that I couldn't chat with her while typing this. Only 5 more minutes left. my laundy is ready to be taken out of the dryer. 4 minutes left to keep typing. I may have to restart the dryer to keep my clothes from wrinkeling. Why did I stop ironing all my clothes all the time. But it feels soooo good to not worry about little stuff like that anymore. I am pleased with the present me; although it is a VERY differnt me. Overall, I am pleased with the present. Getting over Moms death is comming along nicely. Still have my mommy moments though. I guess I always will. Im just glad that the urge to call her every sunday, like I have for years, has stopped. That was VERY irritating every sunday not getting to hear her voice. I miss her. But, thats the consiquence of love. Losing them one day. But man, the number of people that I have lost is astonishing. Damn you Reagan!!! so many deaths on your shoulder.",0
"  Advocates of mandatory military service argue that it promotes patriotism, civic duty, and a sense of responsibility among citizens. Serving in the military can also provide valuable life skills such as leadership, teamwork, and discipline. Furthermore, mandatory service can create a more diverse military by drawing in individuals from different backgrounds and social classes.  On the other hand, opponents of mandatory military service argue that it violates individual freedom and autonomy. Serving in the military can be physically and emotionally demanding, and not everyone may be suited for it. Additionally, mandatory service may disproportionately affect marginalized communities who may not have the same access to resources and opportunities as other groups.  It's also worth noting that the United States has an all-volunteer military, which has been in place since the end of the Vietnam War. Supporters of this model argue that it allows individuals to freely choose whether or not to serve, which aligns with the country's principles of individual liberty and freedom.  Ultimately, whether or not to institute mandatory military service is a complex issue that requires careful consideration of various factors.  ",1
"I am very disappointed. its been raining all day and I'm tired. I didn't sleep last night, that isn't any good. I can't stand not sleeping. Sometimes I think that maybe I'm just not good enough for college, or at least UT. Things have been hectic the whole time I have been on campus, and if I don't do good this semester, I'm going to fail out. I hope that I can pull this all off. The weekend was nice though, partying with all of my fraternity brothers was a good time, and seeing all of my old high school baseball buddies was cool too. I need to do stuff like that more often. I hope that things can get back to the way they used to be, since I liked everything much much more back then, when my whole life was a hell of a lot simpler. I miss high school, sadly enough. I liked school a lot better when it was just me and 1500 other people. I knew everyone, everyone knew me. Life was good. I can't stand this 50k of people on campus around, it drives me crazy. I'm lucky to see A friend walking around campus, let alone a lot of them. Oh well, I hope that life gets better soon. This weekend should be a lot of fun. Oh, my pizza is ready, its been 18 minutes since I sat down. I spend a lot of time thinking and then trying to transfer things to words. Same old problem for me. I can think great, but when it comes to putting things to words, I suck.",0
"Well, here goes. I'm listening to all of the songs i've fuond over the last few days and am slowly getting tired of them. I'm worried about my typing skills too. I've gotten worse and i can't figure out why. Maybe it's the keyboard, or maybe it's the desk. I doubt it's becuase i'm always in a hurry. Why would that be it? I really like this next song though. I hope my roommate is able to get to the movie tonight because i don't want her to miss it. I'm glad that i found someone to go with though. That would be horrible if i hadn't! I'm getting really frustrated that i can't seem to get this Welcome Package! Really, who locks their doors when they know everyone has to get in!! Maybe i'm just really weak and can't get in. No no. . that's not it. They locked their doors. I'm going to have to ask Sarah to go with me. I also need to call Amy. Grr. i don't want to do that , but it would be rude not to call her. What else? I need to go to the gym, but that's another thing i don't want to do alone and sarah's to lazy to go. I'm really excited that there are going to be 5 fred movies in a row this month! What luck! And a   road   movie!! It just proves that soemtimes dreams really do come true. hahha. well, maybe. I just hope i'm able to go home to see it because it comes on really early in the morning and i don't think my roommate would like me to much if i woke her up to watch a movie. Of course, she is a heavy sleeper, so she might not even notice. Man, my arms are getting tired. i don't why that is. i guess i should relax and just sing along.  i'm singing in the rain!   hmmm. . that's not working to well. I really wish i could go home more often because i do not like what the water is doing to my hair. It looks horrible, but i shouldn't care because i've never cared before. Of course, my hair has never looked to so bad before. I'm really tired too. I want to read something interesting for once. I wish I had my Entertainment Weekly already, but nooo, i have to wait till Sept. 27. That's a long time! I don't know if I can wait that long. I need something! I'm dying over here without a book! I have cable now, but that's no substitute. I am glad that the cable has TCM and Cartoon Network. It's weird how my taste changed this summer. I never thought I would be into the PowerPuff Girls, but I am. i really always thought they're name was PowDerPuff Girls. Oops. It's a cute show though. I can't decide who i like the most. It's just one of those shows where the jokes are really subtle, so it makes me feel smart when I get them. Not to many shows can do that nowadays. It's like the movies. Not to many movies make you think anymore. I really wanted to ask Stacy today if she had ever seen Charade because that is a good movie. It makes you think because who would have suspected the guy it was? Of course, once you watch it the second time it's not as good, but that first viewing is great! There are other movies too. The Game was a good one! The one with Micheal Douglas right? That's what the movie is called i believe. I was so shocked. . in fact it's been so long since I've seen it taht i really don't remember what all happened, i just know it made you think. I wish people would come out with more of those movies. Why don't they? Did they decline in popularity? The same question goes for musicals? Why don't they make dancing movies anymore? Of course I've seen some of the more recent dancing movies and they didn't do well at the box office. Maybe the plot could have been better. Plus, today everything has to do with sex appeal. If a movie doesn't have that at least in one spot it's a flop. Ginger and Fred never had to have that. I think the idea of sexual tension helped them out enough. Of course, people used to go see movies just for the actors. People today go for the actors and actresses but they also go for what happens. Why did people go see Fast and the Furious? Because they knew Vin Diesel would show off his body and everything. The movie itself was crap. the plot was zilch. Whatever happened to good comedians too? I'm listening to Jack Benny now and although I don't always understand the jokes, I can tell he was a man many people loved and admired because he's so clean. It doesn't take much to make people laugh, but today the jokes can be so dirty that it's not always funny. I admit i laugh sometimes, but you can't help but feel bad. I hope the movie tonight is worthwhile. Everyone says it's great, obviously because it's a box-office hit. I think it's so great that there's a place where one can view movies for free. Who knew that college would be so nice? I miss my family a lot but i like being able to go out and do other things without having to ask first. I do feel like i have to ask but something stops me everytime. Mom doesn't have to know everything. haha. I hope everyone comes up here soon. Ok, the sound effects man on this episode is rather annoying. After listening to a radio show once you don't want to listen to it to often. The same goes with songs, but i can deal with that. I need to find a Tv guide so i know when Seinfeld and Raymond comes on. It bothers me that i'm missing those. I don't like the guide on the TV, it's hard to follow. Plus, it would be nice to have the guide like at home.",0
" Learning a foreign language can be one of the most rewarding experiences of a lifetime. It opens doors to new cultures, expands one's understanding of the world, and can even improve cognitive abilities. With so many languages to choose from, the decision of which one to learn can be overwhelming. However, in my opinion, if readers were to learn a foreign language, they should consider learning Spanish.  Spanish is the second most widely spoken language in the world, with approximately 460 million native speakers. It is the official language of 21 countries, including Spain, Mexico, Colombia, Argentina, and many others. In the United States alone, there are over 41 million Spanish speakers, making it the second most spoken language after English. This means that learning Spanish can provide readers with the ability to communicate with a significant portion of the global population and open up numerous opportunities for personal and professional growth.  From a cultural perspective, Spanish is rich in literature, music, and art. Spanish authors such as Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Pablo Neruda, and Isabel Allende have produced some of the most celebrated works of modern literature, including magical realism, poetry, and fiction. Spanish-speaking countries have also produced some of the world's most famous artists, including Pablo Picasso, Diego Velazquez, and Frida Kahlo.  Additionally, Spanish is a language that is relatively easy to learn for English speakers. This is because Spanish shares many words with English and has a similar grammatical structure. The Spanish alphabet is also the same as the English alphabet, with the addition of the ñ. This means that learners can quickly gain proficiency in the language, making it a great language to learn for both beginners and those who already have some knowledge of the language.  Moreover, learning Spanish can also have practical benefits. Many employers are looking for bilingual employees, and knowing Spanish can give readers a competitive advantage in the job market. Spanish is especially valuable in industries such as healthcare, education, and hospitality, where there is a high demand for bilingual employees.  Finally, learning Spanish can be a fun and rewarding experience. It provides the opportunity to connect with Spanish-speaking communities, both locally and abroad. Readers can use Spanish to travel to Spanish-speaking countries and communicate with locals, making their travels more immersive and fulfilling. They can also use Spanish to make new friends, learn about new cultures, and expand their horizons.  In conclusion, Spanish is a valuable language to learn for many reasons. It is widely spoken, culturally rich, relatively easy to learn, and can provide numerous personal and professional benefits. Therefore, I highly recommend that readers consider learning Spanish as their foreign language of choice. With so many resources available online, such as language learning apps and online courses, there has never been a better time to start learning Spanish.  ",1

"Jeez, why has it taken my so long to do this assignment?  Why do I always put everything off to the last minute???  Procrastination seems to have effected my whole life. Even when I was a little kid in elementary school I can rememeber putting off projects till the last night. My mom would always get mad and say you should wait till the last minute to do things, but for some reason that just never got through to me. I don't want to procrastinate. but it do. I always tell myself that I'm going to start it early, but it always ends up the same way. Is this the way it's going to be my whole life?  Man, I hope not, but who am I kidding. This is the way my brain functions. Procrastination is apart of me. I love the saying, hard work pays over time, but laziness pays off now. That's like my motto. Even though I wish it wasn't. I wish I could be like those kids who when they got a project assigned in school, to run home and start it right away. I wish my brain would say, lets get all of this hard work out of the way so we can have fun and relax later. But of course the reality is my brain is saying, well since the project isn't do for another week that means I don't have to start it for another week, I can just sit back and relax until then. AAGGGHHHH!  I always tell myself I'm going to change my ways, but it never freaking happens. Well I know I'm not the only one with this problem. I know most other college kids puts things off to the last minute too. But dammit, when I think about it really pisses me off. I should have written this essay last week, but no. Here I am, Sunday night, writing an essay that is due tomorrow. it's just like clockwork. I always put off studying too. I really need to study for tests in advance, but I always wait till the night before to do practically all of my studying. A lot of times I wake up early that moring and study before the test. Damn you procrastination, damn you to hell!  It's going to be the death of me. I can just imagination how much better of a gpa I would have if I would just study more. Things have got to change, or I'm really going to screw up bad. Dammit. All of this writing about procrastination had gotten my thinking about my mom. I know she worries about me. She knows I always procrastinates. I wish she didn't have to worry about me doing ok in school. She didn't have to worry about my older brother. He was an A student. She never had to worry about him making good grades, because he always did. Man, I wish I had his life. His a great job now, makes a good salary, and his future is extremely bright. Now look at me. i'm a C student with and undeclared major. I really don't know what I'm going to do once I get out of college. Thinking about that scares me sometimes. Well it looks like my twenty minutes minutes are about up. Let me just say it's been fun and I wonder if anyone is actually going to read this?  I doubt it, I bet there just going to check to makes sure I've written something cause reading everyones in class would take a hella long time. What's up with the size of our class?  I walked into the room the first day and I was like, damn!  I've never been in a class this big. I feel sorry for the people that get to class only five minutes early, jeez even fifteen minutes early and nearly 3/4's the place is already filled up. Classes just should be this book. Well I guess that's all have to say about that. see  you later.",0
" Some people agree that television violence has a negative effect on society because it promotes violence. They argue that:  Television violence can influence people to become violent and take drugs in the future12. Television violence can desensitize people to real-world violence and make them more accepting of it3. Television violence can affect children’s development and behavior, especially if they identify with aggressive characters or perceive the violence as realistic43. Television violence can increase the risk of aggression and criminality in adulthood, especially for males45. Some people disagree that television violence has a negative effect on society because it does not promote violence. They argue that:  Television violence is not the only or the main cause of violence in society. There are many other factors that contribute to violence, such as poverty, family problems, mental health issues, etc. Television violence can have positive effects on society, such as providing entertainment, catharsis, education, or social awareness. Television violence can have no effect on society, as people can distinguish between fiction and reality and are not influenced by what they see on TV. Television violence can vary in its content, context, and quality, and not all types of TV violence have the same impact on society. In conclusion, there are valid arguments and evidence for both sides of the debate. However, it is important to be aware of the potential effects of television violence on society and to use critical thinking and media literacy skills when watching TV. It is also important to monitor and limit children’s exposure to TV violence and to provide them with alternative sources of entertainment and education.   ",1
" In my opinion, study hall is not a waste of time and can be a necessary break from regular classes. Here are some reasons and examples to support this position:  Time for completing homework: Study hall allows students to use their time wisely and complete homework, assignments, or projects they may not have had time to finish at home. It can also help students who struggle with time management to better organize their workload.  Opportunity for focused study: Study hall can provide a quiet and focused environment for students to study for upcoming exams or quizzes without distractions from home or other classes.  Opportunity for extra help: During study hall, students can ask their teachers for extra help or clarification on topics they may not have understood in class. This can help improve their understanding and boost their grades.  Break from regular classes: Study hall can provide a necessary break from regular classes, which can be mentally exhausting. It can also give students a chance to decompress and reduce stress levels.  Time for extracurricular activities: If students do not have any unfinished work, study hall can also give them time to participate in extracurricular activities such as clubs, sports, or music. This can provide a much-needed break from academic work and promote a healthy balance of activities.  In conclusion, study hall is not a waste of time but a necessary break from regular classes. It provides students with opportunities to complete unfinished work, study, seek extra help, and participate in extracurricular activities.                 ",1
"I'm pretty happy with my first week and a half of classes. I've met a lot of people. It means a lot to me. I am a very quiet, sort of shy person. I was afraid of coming to UT because I'm not the best at making friends. So far though, it hasn't been a problem. My big classes have been a little intimidating because of there size. I used to have classes about 30 or less. Right now I am happy, UT won its first football game. I'm glad I was able to go. It was lots of fun. Now I feel a little exhausted. I haven't really done all that much today. I actually got to sleep for 12 hours last night. I could be exhausted because I am hungry. I think I'm pretty lucky. My parents sent me some food. My brother brought it to Austin. He and I will share it. I'm already starting to miss home-cooked meals. I think my 20 minutes are just about up. I probably fix a bite to eat, watch a little T. V. and go to sleep.",0
"Where do I start? It's funny how when you are actually telling yourself that you need to think of something that things like pink bunny rabbits come to mind. Why? Right now, I'm trying to reorganize my mp3 collection. I thought that if I added a few new categories like 80s, 90s, country, comedy, etc. , that it would be easier to find what I'm looking for when there is something particular I want to hear. I'm usually in an upbeat mood, especially when I have something to do (like school), so I like to listen to upbeat music. But there are times when only slow music like U2's ""Achtung Baby"" album, or other slower music from the 80s. When I like to listen to these slow songs, it's not like I'm in a depressed mood or anything, it's just that I'm thinking about something intensely personal, I guess. I know that when I was breaking up with my last girlfriend, I listened to this music a great deal. It also helps me to be creative. I have a tendency to write things like poems or short stories when I'm in that mood. So, question. Do I have to have a thoughtful demeanor in order to listen to the slow songs, or does listening to that particular kind of music put my mind into a creative thinking mode? Grin and Bear It. I'm a little intimidated by the amount of students I've come into contact with at this university. 50,000 people crammed into a fairly confined land space can make one feel claustrophobic. I like it, though, because everyone here is my age. There is an endless supply of new friends, new faces, new experiences, new situations. I could say that it's advantage of being so big is also a disadvantage. I've been to my Psychology and English classes a couple of times and have yet to see the same face twice in each. I don't know anyone in this city, so it makes adjustment a little hard. My family has moved around quite a bit, so it's not that I'm not used to being new to something, I just wished I had my best friend here to share it with. Andy. Big guy. Sings. Just like me. Likes the same music. Likes the same movies. Likes the same people I do, except when it comes to women. He disapproves of a great deal of my girlfriends. The few that he does like, I seem to like more, too. Strange, though, how those are the ones that move away or want to see other people. I'm hot. My air conditioner hasn't been working these past few days and the apartment people say that they're ""on it. "" Whatever. Some tenants left a note on the manager's office door (the manager has conveniently not been in, either), saying some pretty mean stuff. I think it's funny, but at the same time I try to put myself in the shoes of the manager. She has many things to think about, I'm sure, but still. 110 on the thermometer is no laughing matter, especially for someone who's not from around here. Not used to the heat. My bike needs to be adjusted. It doesn't shift gears the way it should. Up shifting seems to work fine, but when I down shift, the chain doesn't move crisply. I need to find a new seat, too. Maybe one with a little more padding. I hope the interview with Compaq goes well. Not only is it a big company that would give me lots of opportunities, but George Lucas. I want to work for George Lucas.",0
" On the one hand, machines have undoubtedly eliminated much of the manual labor previously required in various industries, resulting in increased efficiency and productivity. Automation has brought about many benefits, including faster production times, reduced labor costs, and improved quality control. For example, in the manufacturing sector, machines can produce items with greater accuracy and speed than humans, and robots can perform repetitive tasks with consistency and precision.  On the other hand, the widespread adoption of machines has led to the displacement of many workers who were once employed in industries that have become automated. This displacement can lead to unemployment and social upheaval, particularly in regions where industries have been the main source of employment. Additionally, machines can eliminate the need for skills previously required for certain jobs, leading to a potential loss of expertise and knowledge. For example, a farmer who previously had to know how to harvest crops by hand may no longer require that skill with the advent of harvesting machines.  In conclusion, while machines have brought about significant benefits in terms of increased efficiency and productivity, they have also resulted in significant job displacement and the potential loss of skills and expertise. Therefore, it's essential to find a balance between technological advancement and the preservation of skills and knowledge, ensuring that the benefits of automation are equitably distributed.

" An adjective is a word that describes or modifies a noun or pronoun123. It can provide more information about the qualities, number, or identity of the noun or pronoun1. For example, in the sentence “She is a kind person”, the word “kind” is an adjective that describes the noun “person”.  To explain why a particular adjective describes me perfectly, I would need to choose an adjective that reflects my personality, appearance, skills, or values. Then I would need to give specific examples of how that adjective applies to me and how it distinguishes me from others. For instance, if I choose the adjective “creative”, I could write something like this:  Creative is an adjective that describes me perfectly because I enjoy using my imagination and originality to produce something new or different. I am creative in various aspects of my life, such as writing, drawing, cooking, and solving problems. For example, I like to write poems and stories that express my feelings and ideas in a unique way. I also like to draw cartoons and illustrations that make people laugh or think. When I cook, I experiment with different ingredients and flavors to create delicious dishes. And when I face a challenge, I try to find innovative solutions that work for me and others. Being creative helps me to express myself, have fun, learn new things, and overcome difficulties. It also makes me different from other people who may not share my interests or talents. Therefore, creative is an adjective that perfectly describes who I am and what I do.   ",1
" Choosing the right college is a crucial decision that will impact your academic and personal life for the next few years. Here are some steps to follow to help you make an informed decision:  Consider your academic goals: Start by thinking about your academic interests, career aspirations, and the type of degree you want to pursue. Research the schools that offer programs in your field of interest and see which ones have a strong reputation.  Determine your budget: Think about how much you can afford to spend on college, including tuition, room and board, textbooks, and other expenses. Consider applying for financial aid or scholarships if you need help covering the cost of tuition.  Research the location: Consider the location of the college, the campus size, and the surrounding community. Do you prefer a rural or urban setting? Is the college located in a place where you can pursue your extracurricular interests?  Look at the campus culture: Consider the student body, campus activities, and the overall vibe of the college. Do you feel like you would fit in with the student population? Do they offer clubs and activities that align with your interests?  Visit the college: If possible, visit the campus and attend a campus tour or open house. Talk to current students, professors, and admissions officers to get a sense of what the college is like.  Consider the reputation: Check the college's rankings, graduation rates, and employment outcomes. Look at alumni success stories to see where graduates of the college have ended up.  Trust your gut: Ultimately, you want to choose a college that feels like the right fit for you. Listen to your intuition and choose a school where you feel comfortable and excited to attend.   ",1
"I am curious on why we need to do this assignment. Is it some sort of test? Or experiment? Well I guess I have to do it any way, so. I'm think that it is late and that damn pretesting takes to much time to just answer the same questions reworded ten times each. I hope my show in San Antonio goes well Wednesday I hope those assheads advertised this time but if not we still get paid. But that's still bad business. I really like the Common Sense album I think I'll burn a copy from sterling. I wonder what my roommates are up to? Probably just sleeping since they all have early class in the morning. My earliest class is Spanish and I dread going to that class. Man it takes up most of my schedule and if I don't do well it will bring my grade down big time, but crap like that happens. At least I can still be a frigging rockstar ha if all else fails. Which isn't looking so bad or hard by today's standards. One hit song will get you paid for life and all I hit songs needs is radio play. NO heart felt lyrics; no emotion, no good beat, and no moveable beat at all even just radio play. If you make it on TRL your set damn we played with Papa Roach and there were probably 700 people at the show the next week they were on TRL and now they could probably sell out a 10,000seat venue easy. I'm not putting them down they are a good band but that just goes to show you how the industry works. One of these days I'll be on top though no doubt. My band plays with a new band or a go to see a new band play ever week and half of them have no stage presence of any show what so ever. And if the crowd is not interested you can sell your total package to them. You can be a band that gets lots of radio play, but if you can get the crowd moving on tour your going to just sparkle and fade. My only fear is I'll be a 30yearold man with kids and still be hunting for this illusive dream and I really don't want to be in that boat. I assume I'll know when the ship has sailed and I'll just except it and move on not swim after it just to sink deeper. Only time will tell though, if nothing else I had my days in the spot light but if my 15 minutes of fame are already up I'm going to be one upset greedy bastard trying to get my hand on just a little more. I guess I've talked about my dream of being a musician enough so I'll move on to my goals at school, which as you can tell are of lesser importance right now. Not to say they are not important it just my dreams cloud my reality and sometimes it hard to see what I need to do rather what I want to do. SO my time is up and I'll see you in class Thursday.",0

Oh well, at least I've found somebody that I like. I wish Marques was here so that I could take my mind off of all these cute men. My nursing class is cool. Are you sure that you wanted us to just type whatever comes to our minds. Well, I don't think you want to get inside my mind. There's a whole lot of stuff that should not be open to the public right now. I guess everybody thinks like this though. I can't call myself different because sometimes I know that I am different. I don't think like everybody else I know. I think I'm a little bit on the crazier side than they like to think I am. Okay, I have been typing for 12 minutes now. I told you that I don't have anything to say. It's not like I don't write in my journal every night. I know how my mind works and I don't particularly like it. I happen to think I'm a little nuts, but who isn't. This isn't all about me though. I'm not the teacher so I guess I just have to sit here and type until your hearts content. That's what I'm here for. My mom tries to make people happy too much. She had to go to a craziness doctor a few years ago because she almost had a nervous breakdown. I thought it was funny though so maybe that's mean of me but if you knew my mother you would think it was funny too. She's not a very nice lady and she bothers me way too much. I wish she would stop calling and acting like that good little mother that she always want to be. She's not. I love my daddy. He called while William was still in the bed this morning. Not good. He kept tickling me and my dad was kind of getting suspicious but William plays too much anyway. I need to go take a nap and it's been more that twenty minutes so I'll talk to you later.",0
" The current U.S. tax system is progressive, which means that individuals with higher incomes pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes than those with lower incomes. The argument for a flat tax system is that it would simplify the tax code and create a fairer system in which everyone pays the same percentage of their income in taxes.  Proponents of the flat tax argue that it would eliminate the need for complicated tax forms and reduce the compliance costs associated with the current system. They also argue that it would be fairer because everyone would be contributing the same percentage of their income, regardless of their income level.  However, opponents of the flat tax argue that it would disproportionately benefit the wealthy and hurt low-income individuals. Under a flat tax system, individuals with high incomes would pay a lower percentage of their income in taxes than they currently do, while low-income individuals would pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes. This could exacerbate income inequality and make it harder for low-income individuals to make ends meet.  Furthermore, the current progressive tax system is designed to provide a safety net for those who are struggling financially. For example, low-income individuals are often eligible for tax credits and other benefits that can help them make ends meet. A flat tax system would eliminate these benefits, making it harder for low-income individuals to get by.  In conclusion, the choice between a progressive and flat tax system ultimately comes down to values and priorities. While a flat tax system may simplify the tax code, it may also exacerbate income inequality and hurt low-income individuals. The current progressive tax system, while more complicated, is designed to provide a safety net for those who are struggling financially.      ",1
" Offer emotional support: Being sick can be a very difficult and lonely experience. Simply being there for your friend or relative and listening to them can provide much-needed emotional support. Express empathy and let them know that you care about them.  Help with practical tasks: When someone is sick, they may have trouble with everyday tasks such as cooking, cleaning, or grocery shopping. Offer to help with these tasks or run errands for them. You could also offer to pick up their medications or drive them to doctor appointments.  Provide a comfortable environment: If your friend or relative is staying at home, make sure that their environment is comfortable and conducive to healing. This could involve things like bringing over blankets or pillows, adjusting the lighting or temperature, or playing soothing music.  Offer to communicate with healthcare providers: If your friend or relative is having trouble communicating with their healthcare providers, offer to help them by taking notes, asking questions, or relaying information.  Provide entertainment: Being sick can be boring and lonely. You could offer to bring over books, movies, or games to help pass the time.

"Well, I'm in my dorm room right now and I just finished playing a computer game called WarCraft 3. It's a very addicting game and I think I play it too much. I should be doing more important stuff like studying, or I could read a book or something like that. I'm feeling pretty happy because today I really don't have any more classes to go to, but I know I have homework to do. I also have to go reset my business passwordfor my email account at the Millenium Lab. Even though I'm feeling fine right now, overall I feel pretty overwhelmed with me in college and all. I also have other stuff on my mind which worries me. Stuff that deals with my family and friends. I think I left a lot of loose ends back home in Houston. I really want to tie up those loose ends though. That's one thing about me I like; I may not finish doing something or procrastinate a lot, but I always end up finishing a job, which I think is very important. If you start something you have to finish it or at least that's how I feel. I'm listening to music on MTV now and I love listening to music. I would'nt feel comfortable if there was not some kind of noise happening in here. I don't like it when it's silent for some reason. I prefer when the TV is on, or someone is talking to me. For some people, relaxing means laying down in silence. For me, it's listening to my favorite songs. And I like all kinds of songs. Rock, Rap, Hip-Hop, Alternative, Classic Rock, and even some country and classical. I'm pretty well-rounded in my musical tastes. I think that reflects me as a person also. I am  very accepting of all types of personal tastes that others may have. I like that about myself also. I wonder how my parents are feeling about me being gone. I hate to admit it but I really do miss them. I also miss my sisters and playing with their kids. My niece and nephew's are so much fun to play with. I wish they were right here with me right now. I would love to show them the campus. I feel really bad about my dad having to pay so much money for me to get my education here. I want to help out more. I hate it when my parents have to put up money for me. I usually try to stay independant of the them when it comes to cash. I need to get a job soon to help out money-wise. It will be hard juggling school and a job, but I did it in high school. I know college is different than high school, but it's something I have to do. It will make me feel better. I've liked my time here at UT so far though. This is a really neat place. I mentioned before that I feel overwhelmed, but I'm trying to not make it stress me out. I'm pretty good at keeping my stress level low. Most people stress about little things, and that's not good for you. I'm hoping that I get good grades and I'm really going to try to do my best here and not just play around. Tomorrow is the September 11th anniversary (1 year). I see stuff about it all the time on TV. That event really made me feel patriotic and made me very very proud to be an American. It got me mad that people would do that. In fact it got me really mad. I wanted to do something and thoughts about joining the army came into my mind but I never really took that seriously. Instead I went to go donate blood. I figured I would try to help out any way I could. But all in all, I'm proud to be living in the greatest country in the world. I'm going to try and go to the ceromony on the south lawn. I hope it will be meaningful. Basically I have lots of emotions running through me, but the trick is to balance them as evenly as possible.",0

"I am tired today. I should have gone to bed earlier. I need to study. How much do I need to read for my classes to get A's in them? I have to do my economics homework today. I miss home I miss my family. I have never been away from home for this long. I won't get to see my parents till parents weekend but that will be really nice. I have a fraternity meeting at 6:30. I can't wait until the next football game, the game this past weekend was awesome. I need to wear a hat at the next game cause I got a bad sunburn last weekend. My face hurts from the sunburn still. I wonder when our next fraternity mixer will be. A picture reminds me of my Europe trip last summer. It was one of the best experiences I have ever had. I have a paranoid feeling that I am not doing enough work or studying, that I am neglecting something. I hate doing laundry, I have already had to do it twice since I've been in Austin. It hasn't rained since I've been here, I wonder when it will rain. I hate the heat and humidity in Austin. I can't wait till it cools down and turns into fall. The girl in my business administration class yesterday was very pretty, maybe I can go on a date with her sometime this semester.

"I guess the way I feel right now is overwhelmed. I just came back from a class of 540 students, which is double the number of kids in my whole graduating class. Although there are many students here who are so excited to be away from home and all on their own I wouldn't mind going back home and staying their for a while. I am very pleased with my life at home and this sudden change has left me to start all over. Although I know this is a part of life I feel as thought I am losing some of my childhood friends yet no one is replacing them. At first I told myself that is just how I feel and if those childhood friends felt the same then I might be right but this whole summer all of my high school friends were ready to leave for college. Now that we are all separated we understand how much we depended on each other. I have been here three days and everyday for at least an hour I have talked to my friend back home. I guess what scares me the most is that when you meet someone here you have no idea where they came from, where they have been, or what type of person they are. Back at home we all knew each others families, knew what type of person they where etc. I can truly same that moving to Austin has definitely made me reevaluate myself. Not to be cocky but back at home everyone knew who I was and what type of person I was, but here everyone thinks I am a nobody. I feel as thought I have to impress someone for him or her to approach me where at home others approached me. I guess the comfort of home was my stability and now that I am here I have to build a new foundation to start from. I am very great full that there is one other person from my school here because we are together all the time and it makes this transition just a bit easier. Now that we have started classes I am trying to busy myself with my work, which is, a good thing and then it seem as thought time goes by a lot faster. I think I just have to mental got myself ready for this semester and then I will be fine. I do like challenges and that is why I came to this university but the challenges I expected are not the ones I am having trouble adjusting too. It is completely different aspects of college life that has thrown me off.",0
"The past week I have honestly felt the most incredible feeling of being overwhelmed. I am so frustrated and annoyed by everyone around me and everything that they do. I so badly want to step forward and correct everything that these people are doing wrong but for some reason I keep holding myself back. This frustration only makes my head hurt and keeps me angry at the world. My presence then becomes quite rude and unfriendly. I'm not quite sure what to do about this little problem. I really don't think that it's me. My suitemate is about to push me over the edge. She never picks up after herself, never helps clean the dorm room, never buys and groceries (even though she finds its all right to consume mass quantities of the food that me and my two other roomates buy), and she basically is worthless around the room. For example, the other day she mentioned that we needed paper towels and bottled water. On most circumstances that wouldnt bother me, however, she makes these claims but at the same time takes no initiative to fix them. She just assumes that me or my roomates will take care of the missing items in the room. She is from Beverly Hills. Im under that impression that she had someone to pick up after her and do everything for her when she lived there. Typical if you ask me. I just can't handle her behavior or her attitude anymore. On top of that, I am homesick. I miss my friends. I miss being with Richie. He'll call me once and a while. Usually he'll call me non stop for a straight week, and then I won't hear from him for quite a while. I get so anxious to hear from him, but he acts like he could care less if he talked to me. That makes me so mad. My roomate aka my best friend since middle school chastises me everytime i talk to him. It just makes me so upset that she thinks that he doesnt care about me in the least. Sure, he may not show the normal feelings that most people show towards the ones that they care about, but I know that he cares about me. If he didnt care, he wouldnt bother calling me. Its honestly one of the worst feelings knowing that your best friend in the world is sitting there making fun of you and getting annoyed by the fact that you are in a complete state of happiness when you talk to the one person you care about. It really makes me wonder why she is the one person I confide in the most. Speaking of her, she is in this relationship with a boy whom I adore as a friend. He is so much fun to be around, but he is here all the time. I turn around and he is always there. I never get to sleep in my own room, I am constantly forgotten about or simply not included in activities that she would normally include me in, and to top it all off, the relationship is not even healthy. I find it ironic that she gets mad at me when I talk to Richie, and feels that she can make whatever assumptions or claims about my relationship with him, but when I make the smallest remark about her and her boyfriend, she flips out. It doesn't seem all that fair to me. But then again, what is fair?  Is it fair that I want to be with someone that I can't have anymore? No its not fair, but thats the way that it will be. Sometimes I wonder if I will ever get a break; If maybe one day I'll get lucky and things will turn out the way I wanted them to, or if maybe Richie will wake up one day and decide that he wants to be with me and not with the girl he is with right now. Sometimes I wonder if my relationship with my mom will ever improve. She and I couldn't possibly be more different than we are. I can't even believe that I am her child sometimes. She acts so much like a child. If she doesn't get her way she mopes and she has to put me down to make herself feel better. She denies having made my sister depressed throughout her late childhood and early adultood. I think that its the subtle remarks about my figure, my study habits, my relationships that make me so mad at her. I want to tell her how I feel but she will retaliate and take something away from me that I need. She always used to do that in high school. If I told her what was on my mind, she would take away my car, or my privileges to stay out late. I can never win. Its either   give up my priviliges   or keep my mouth shut. It is a lose lose situation. I just miss Richie so much. That could be the root of all my unhappiness. My mom, and suitemate could all just be elements of my sadness due to my distance away from him. He called me today. Ironically I was lying in bed thinking about him, when the phone rang. It felt so good to see his name on my cell phone when i looked at it.",0
" Simmons' quote suggests that if we live only in the present and ignore the consequences of our actions, we may damage our future. This can be true in some cases, particularly when we make impulsive decisions that have negative long-term effects.  On the other hand, living in the moment can also be beneficial for our well-being, as it allows us to fully appreciate the present and find joy in small moments. Moreover, some opportunities may only be available to us in the present moment, and postponing them may lead to regrets in the future.  Therefore, I believe that the quote can be interpreted in different ways depending on the context. While it is important to consider the long-term consequences of our actions, we should also learn to find a balance between living in the moment and planning for the future.    ",1

" On one hand, computers can provide students with access to a vast amount of information and resources that may not be available in a traditional classroom setting. With the internet, students can explore topics in-depth and access a wide range of multimedia materials that can enhance their learning experience. For instance, a student can use a computer to watch educational videos, access virtual field trips, and collaborate with other students on group projects.  Moreover, computers can also help students develop important skills that are essential in the modern world, such as critical thinking, problem-solving, and digital literacy. By using computers, students can learn how to analyze and evaluate information, communicate effectively using digital tools, and develop a deeper understanding of complex concepts.  On the other hand, some educators argue that computers can be a distraction in the classroom and may interfere with the learning process. For instance, students may be tempted to browse social media or play games during class, which can negatively affect their academic performance. Additionally, some students may become overly reliant on computers and fail to develop their critical thinking and problem-solving skills without the aid of technology.  In conclusion, while computers can be a valuable tool in the classroom, their effectiveness ultimately depends on how they are used. Educators must carefully consider the benefits and drawbacks of incorporating computers into their teaching methods and develop strategies to ensure that they are used in a productive and effective way.

"  Purchasing a new state-of-the-art computer is a major investment, and it is important to ensure that you make an informed decision. Here are some steps you can take to make sure you are making the right choice:  Determine your needs: The first step in buying a new computer is to determine your needs. Consider what you will be using the computer for, and what specific features you need. Do you need a powerful processor for gaming or video editing? Do you need a large amount of storage space for files or media? Do you need a high-resolution display for graphic design or video editing? Write down a list of your requirements and prioritize them.  Set a budget: After determining your needs, set a budget for your new computer. This will help you narrow down your options and avoid overspending.  Do research: Research different computer brands, models, and specifications that fit your needs and budget. Read reviews from other users and technology experts to get an idea of the pros and cons of each model.  Compare prices: Once you have narrowed down your options, compare the prices of the models you are considering. Look for deals and promotions that may be available.  Consider warranties and support: Make sure to check the warranty and support options for the computer models you are considering. Some manufacturers offer longer warranties or better customer support than others.  Visit a store: If possible, visit a store to see and test the computers you are considering in person. This can give you a better idea of the computer's size, weight, and features, and can help you make a more informed decision.  Make the purchase: After you have compared prices, warranties, and support options, and have decided on a computer that meets your needs and budget, make the purchase.  By following these steps, you can ensure that you make an appropriate decision when purchasing a new state-of-the-art computer.         ",1
" In recent years, the United States has been perceived by some as a nation of ""couch potatoes."" This stereotype is not without basis, as many Americans lead sedentary lifestyles that involve a lot of sitting and minimal physical activity. However, this lack of activity has significant consequences for our health and well-being. In this essay, I will make a case for why it is important to be physically active and encourage readers to incorporate more movement into their daily lives.  To begin with, physical activity is essential for maintaining good health. Regular exercise has been shown to reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and certain types of cancer. It can also improve overall health by helping to manage weight, reducing the risk of osteoporosis, and improving mental health. Being physically active can also increase energy levels, improve sleep quality, and reduce stress levels.  Beyond the health benefits, physical activity can also be an enjoyable and social experience. Exercise can be a great way to meet new people and make friends. Participating in team sports, joining a fitness class, or taking a dance lesson can all be great opportunities to connect with others who share similar interests. Additionally, exercise can be a great way to enjoy nature and explore new places. Going for a hike, a bike ride, or a swim in the ocean can all be fun and rewarding experiences.  However, despite these benefits, many Americans struggle to incorporate physical activity into their daily lives. One reason for this is the perception that exercise has to be time-consuming and intense. In reality, even small amounts of activity can have significant health benefits. Walking for just 30 minutes a day can help reduce the risk of chronic diseases and improve overall health. Additionally, there are many ways to incorporate movement into your daily routine, such as taking the stairs instead of the elevator or doing some light stretching during a break at work.  Another obstacle to physical activity is the belief that it has to be expensive. While gym memberships and fitness classes can be costly, there are many ways to be active that don't require a lot of money. Going for a run or a walk outside is free, and there are many free resources available online that offer workouts and exercise routines that can be done at home with minimal equipment.  In conclusion, physical activity is essential for maintaining good health and well-being. Despite the stereotype of the ""couch potato,"" there are many ways to be physically active that are enjoyable, social, and accessible. By incorporating movement into our daily lives, we can improve our health, connect with others, and enjoy all the benefits that come with an active lifestyle. So let's get up, get moving, and start living our best lives!                ",1
" As an AI language model, I don't have a personal opinion, but I can provide information to help you form your own perspective.  In my opinion, school cafeterias should offer low-fat and vegetarian lunch options to accommodate the diverse eating habits of all students. The availability of such options is crucial as students with different dietary restrictions and preferences should be able to enjoy healthy and nutritious meals during their school day.  Firstly, providing low-fat and vegetarian options in school cafeterias can help promote healthy eating habits among students. Students who consume a healthy diet tend to perform better academically and are less likely to develop health problems in the long run. This is especially important given the rising rates of obesity and other diet-related health issues among young people.  Secondly, offering low-fat and vegetarian options is an inclusive approach that caters to the diverse needs and preferences of students. Students who follow a vegetarian diet, for instance, may feel left out or even discriminated against if there are no suitable options available for them. By offering such options, schools can create a more welcoming and inclusive environment that values diversity.  Lastly, offering low-fat and vegetarian options can also be cost-effective in the long run. A healthy diet can lead to fewer absences due to illness, which can in turn reduce healthcare costs. Additionally, by catering to the dietary needs of all students, schools can ensure that students are more likely to purchase lunch from the cafeteria, which can increase revenue for the school.  In conclusion, I believe that schools should provide low-fat and vegetarian options in their cafeterias to accommodate the diverse dietary needs and preferences of students. Doing so can promote healthy eating habits, create a more inclusive environment, and be cost-effective in the long run.           ",1
"I just don't understand why things didn't work out. How can you honestly be so mean. I thought that you loved me. I loved you. I still love you. What went wrong?  I can't remember what went wrong last semester, but I am sure you would remind me if you had to. Gaw this song by John Mayer reminds me of you. Our love was so comfortable, so broken in. ""  Why did my parents disapprove of you and us?  Are you really that bad?  Are you really not that good for me?  I thought I could trust my own emotions. Why don't my parents trust me?  Or is it even a trust issue. Can I really not love at such a young age?  Ug. So many questions running through my mind. Why are you all I think about?  Wow, I wonder if this is obsessive. How do you even spell that darn word. Haha. Why do I always think in question form. Man, I want to go see you so bad. I really think I am coming for your birthday. But am I going to regret it?  Gaww, everyone tells me not to go. But they should take their own advise sometimes. I mean they don't even think the Bible is real. Sometimes I feel like I am the only one who believes in God. How can I trust my friends advice when they don't even believe the same thing I do!  If only I knew what God wanted for me. Talk about a stressful time. I never knew college would be so difficult. Academically I figured it would be but emotionally. Wow. Its incredible how much I have already changed. For the better?  I hope. I think I have though. I just wish I had you back Robert. I wish things could be like they used to. Why did you even call and apologize for everything you did wrong?  I know you still love me. Why do you even want me to come see you?  Do you want to be back with me?  I know you don't. Or do you ? You have fun being single. Why can't I?  Why can't I meet someone else to take my mind off of you. Are you the one?  Man, should I even be thinking like this at 20?  Ha. Maybe I am weird. Oh well. This song is extremely depressing. I am glad my roommates aren't here or they would be making fun of me for listening to it. Get over Robert Kimberly! Get over him!  If only  they knew I am trying, so hard. Gosh, its not like I have not prayed every night for Gods help. I mean geeze. I don't think he is suppose to be out of my life. But then if he is not, why was he so mean to me. I would have never done that to him. Never hurt him for anything. I guess I am a door mat. Its not that I let people walk all over me, its just that I don't ever want anyone to feel what I have. Why would I ever let anyone hurt on purpose?  If I had to choose between myself experiencing hurt and someone else, I would take the hurt in a second. I hate seeing people suffer. I will suffer before anyone I love does. So does that make me a door mat. Am I really too forgiving?  People can change. Or is that my fantasy world. I want to be with you Robert. So why can't I?  Because of my parents?  Yeah right. I can make my own decisions. Gaw, am I really that immature too?  No!  I am very mature for my age. He was always there for me when I needed him the most. He was my shoulder to cry on. Yeah last year was tough and I may have been to needy and dependent on him. But the break up made me realize that and now I am not as dependent. I am fine without him and I realized I have to  make myself happy. So why does not he want to be with me now?  Does he?  He calls me all the time. Tells me he loves me and misses me. Wow I thought girls were complicated. Lol. That is why I need to see him. I need to read his eyes. The second he looks at me I will be able to tell what he feels without him even saying anything. I am good at that. I can read people easy. I get it from mom. Man she can see right though me. So then why couldn't she see how special Robert was for me. Gosh, I should seriously be thinking about something else other than him. Like school. Hehe. That is more important. But then he is too. He is everything I want in a husband when he is good. I mean he has his flaws but don't we all. Forgive and forget. That is what I do. That is what Pastor Ball said yesterday. You have to forgive a person to enjoy them again. Well, I have forgiven everyone I know. Why can Robert be forgiven. Why can't they let him be apart of my life. I get so angry when I think about it all. I love you parents, but man you really messed up this time. I  have forgiven you for it. So forgive Robert. Geeze, my hands are starting to hurt. Lol. Not used to this much typing. Its like he is a disease. I can't get rid of him in my mind. Now that is unhealthy. But I can push you aside when I need to. Like tonight, way to much homework to dwell on him. Yeah that is what messed me up last semester. To emotionally involved. But this semester I am so much better. I have control over my life again. Yeah!  But I just can't get upset if things don't go my way. I mean life has its ups and downs. And its not Robert that I need in my life. I just need to keep God in my life and He will help me. But then again I wouldn't mind having Robert too. Hehe.",0
" The movie and TV ratings systems were created to provide information to audiences about the content of films and TV shows, in order to help them make informed decisions about what they want to watch. The goal of these systems is to ensure that viewers are not exposed to material that they might find inappropriate or offensive.  The effectiveness and usefulness of these ratings systems depend on various factors, such as the accuracy of the ratings, the consistency of their application, and the level of awareness and understanding of the audience.  For example, in the United States, the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) assigns ratings to movies based on their content, such as G (General Audiences), PG (Parental Guidance Suggested), PG-13 (Parents Strongly Cautioned), R (Restricted), and NC-17 (No One 17 and Under Admitted). Similarly, TV Parental Guidelines assign ratings to TV shows based on their content, such as TV-Y (All Children), TV-Y7 (Older Children), TV-G (General Audience), TV-PG (Parental Guidance Suggested), TV-14 (Parents Strongly Cautioned), and TV-MA (Mature Audience Only).  While these ratings systems provide a general idea of the content of movies and TV shows, they are not always accurate or consistent. Some films or TV shows might receive a lower rating than they deserve, while others might be given a higher rating than necessary. Additionally, the rating system might not capture certain types of content that could be potentially harmful or offensive.  Moreover, the effectiveness of these ratings systems also depends on the level of awareness and understanding of the audience. While some viewers may rely on ratings to decide what to watch, others may not pay much attention to them, or may not fully understand what the different ratings mean.  In conclusion, while movie and TV ratings systems can be useful in providing information about the content of films and TV shows, their effectiveness depends on various factors. Ultimately, it is up to the individual viewer to decide what they want to watch and to be aware of the potential risks and benefits of different types of content.           ",1
" There are valid reasons for both options, and ultimately, the decision depends on an individual's circumstances and goals.  For those who choose to go straight to college after high school, they can build momentum and stay on track with their education. They may also have a better chance of securing scholarships or financial aid if they apply immediately. Additionally, they can establish a social network and develop valuable skills while studying.  On the other hand, taking a year or more off to work or travel can provide valuable life experiences that can enhance a person's academic pursuits. Working can help people save money for tuition and provide real-world experience that can complement their studies. Traveling, on the other hand, can offer unique perspectives and cultural insights that can be beneficial in the classroom and beyond.  Ultimately, the decision to go to college immediately or take a gap year should be based on individual circumstances, goals, and priorities. It is important to weigh the potential benefits and drawbacks of both options and make an informed decision.            ",1
"  As an AI language model, I don't have a physical presence to travel, but I do have access to vast amounts of information about various places around the world. One place that I believe is very meaningful and rewarding to visit is the ancient city of Petra, located in Jordan.  Petra is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and is considered one of the New Seven Wonders of the World. It is a city carved out of rock, dating back to the 3rd century BC, and was the capital of the Nabataean Kingdom. The city was lost to the world for centuries and was only rediscovered in the early 19th century.  The main attraction in Petra is the Treasury, a stunning temple carved into the rock face, which is believed to have been used as a tomb for a Nabataean king. The Treasury is one of the most iconic images of Petra and has been featured in many movies and TV shows. Visitors can also explore the many other temples, tombs, and monuments in the city, including the Monastery, which is reached by climbing a series of steep steps.  Aside from the incredible architecture, Petra also has a rich history and culture. The Nabataeans were skilled traders and controlled the spice and incense trade routes between Arabia and the Mediterranean. The city's location at the crossroads of these trade routes made it a hub of cultural exchange, and visitors can still see evidence of the diverse cultures that passed through the city.  Moreover, Petra is located in a beautiful and rugged landscape. The city is surrounded by mountains and canyons, which offer a range of hiking opportunities, from easy walks to challenging treks. Visitors can also explore the Wadi Rum desert, which is located nearby and is famous for its stunning sandstone formations and Lawrence of Arabia connections.  Visiting Petra is a once-in-a-lifetime experience that should not be missed. It offers a unique combination of history, culture, architecture, and natural beauty that is unparalleled. Whether you are a history buff, an architecture enthusiast, or an adventurer, Petra has something to offer everyone. So, if you are planning a trip to Jordan, make sure you include Petra in your itinerary. It will be a trip you will never forget.       ",1
" A school is a place where students receive formal education and instruction from teachers or instructors. Schools can range from early childhood education centers to universities, and they can be public or private.  A typical school consists of classrooms where students attend lectures and participate in activities and discussions, libraries where they can access learning materials, laboratories for conducting experiments, and recreational areas where they can socialize and engage in physical activities.  Schools often have a structured curriculum that is designed to provide students with a broad and balanced education. The curriculum typically includes subjects such as math, science, language arts, social studies, physical education, and the arts. Students are assessed on their knowledge and skills through various forms of testing and evaluation.  In addition to academic instruction, schools also often provide students with opportunities for personal and social development. This can include extracurricular activities such as sports, music, theater, and clubs, as well as programs focused on character education, community service, and leadership development.  Overall, a school is a place where students can acquire knowledge, develop skills, and build relationships that will help them succeed in their personal and professional lives.   ",1
" On the one hand, some people argue that a politician's private life should be of little concern to the public. They believe that what politicians do in their private lives is irrelevant to their ability to govern and make decisions that affect the public. Furthermore, they argue that the media's excessive focus on the personal lives of politicians can distract from more important issues and potentially damage their reputation unfairly.  On the other hand, others argue that a politician's private life is relevant to their ability to govern and make decisions that affect the public. They believe that a politician's personal values and behavior can provide insight into their character and decision-making abilities. Additionally, they argue that a politician's behavior in their private life can be an indication of their honesty, integrity, and commitment to public service.  Moreover, some argue that a politician's personal behavior can have implications for their political decisions. For example, if a politician has a history of infidelity, they may be more susceptible to bribery or other forms of unethical behavior. Similarly, if a politician has a history of substance abuse or addiction, they may not be able to make sound decisions regarding drug policy.  In conclusion, the question of whether we should be concerned with the private affairs of politicians is complex, and opinions vary. Ultimately, the decision of how much weight to give to a politician's personal life is up to the individual voter. However, it is essential to consider the potential implications of a politician's behavior on their ability to govern and represent the interests of the public.                 ",1

Remember, a magician never reveals their secrets, so it's important to practice your tricks and present them in a convincing and engaging way to make them truly magical. ",1
" I can suggest a possible item to be placed in a time capsule for future generations based on its cultural significance and representation of the 21st century.  One item that I believe embodies the culture of the early 21st century is the smartphone. Smartphones have revolutionized the way people communicate, access information, and interact with the world. They are an indispensable part of modern life, and their impact is felt in almost every aspect of society.  Smartphones have changed the way people interact with one another, allowing people to communicate instantaneously across vast distances through messaging apps, social media, and video calls. They have also transformed the way we access information, making it possible to quickly and easily look up any question or query on the internet.  Furthermore, smartphones have also revolutionized the way people consume media, allowing them to stream movies, TV shows, and music on-demand. They have also created new forms of entertainment, such as mobile gaming and social media challenges.  Overall, the smartphone represents the pinnacle of technological advancement in the 21st century. It embodies the culture of the era, where people are increasingly connected to one another and the world around them, and where information is readily accessible at all times. It would be fitting to place a smartphone in a time capsule for future generations to understand the cultural significance and technological advancements of the early 21st century.       ",1
"  Ending a relationship can be a difficult and emotional decision, and it's important to handle it with care and respect for the other person's feelings. Here are some steps you can take if you want to end a relationship:  Reflect on your decision: Before taking any action, take some time to reflect on your decision to end the relationship. Make sure it's what you truly want and that you've considered all the possible outcomes.  Choose the right time and place: It's important to choose the right time and place to have the conversation. Choose a private and comfortable location where you can have an open and honest discussion without interruption.  Be honest and respectful: When you have the conversation, be honest and respectful about your decision. Be clear and direct about why you want to end the relationship, but also be mindful of the other person's feelings. Avoid blaming or criticizing the other person, and instead focus on your own feelings and needs.  Listen and respond: Allow the other person to express their feelings and respond to their questions or concerns. Be empathetic and understanding, but also firm in your decision.  Set boundaries: After ending the relationship, it's important to set clear boundaries and stick to them. This may include taking some time apart or cutting off contact altogether, depending on the situation.  Remember, ending a relationship can be difficult, but it's important to prioritize honesty, respect, and empathy throughout the process. ",1
" Causes of not voting in elections:  Apathy or lack of interest: Many people simply do not care about politics or feel that their vote will not make a difference.  Inconvenience: Some people may not vote because they find it difficult or inconvenient to get to the polling station, especially if they are busy or have other commitments.  Disillusionment with politics: A lack of trust in politicians or the political process can lead to people feeling that voting is pointless or ineffective.  Inaccessibility: Certain groups of people, such as those with disabilities or language barriers, may face obstacles that prevent them from voting.  Voter suppression: In some cases, efforts to suppress certain groups from voting can lead to lower turnout.  Effects of not voting in elections:  Decreased legitimacy of election outcomes: When fewer people vote, the legitimacy of the election outcome may be called into question.  Under-representation of certain groups: Low turnout may result in certain groups being under-represented in government, which can have negative consequences for their interests and needs.  Policy decisions may not reflect public opinion: If fewer people vote, policy decisions may not accurately reflect the views of the public.  Missed opportunity to influence change: Voting provides an opportunity for citizens to influence the direction of their government and society, and not voting means missing out on this opportunity.  Reduced accountability of elected officials: When fewer people vote, elected officials may be less accountable to the public, as they may feel that they do not need to cater to a wider range of voters.

" The issue of labeling albums with explicit content warnings has been a controversial topic for decades. While some argue that labeling is enough to warn parents about inappropriate lyrics, others believe that more needs to be done.  One potential solution would be for the record industry to implement a rating system similar to the movie industry. This would involve assigning ratings to albums based on the content, such as ""PG-13"" or ""R"" ratings. This would allow parents to make more informed decisions about what their children are exposed to.  Another potential solution would be for the record industry to provide more detailed information about the content of each album on their websites or in stores. This could include providing a list of all songs with explicit content and a brief explanation of why they are labeled as such.  Ultimately, the best solution may be a combination of these approaches. By providing more information and implementing a rating system, parents would have more tools to make informed decisions about the media their children consume.  ",1
" The proverb ""Better a lie that soothes than a truth that hurts"" suggests that it is preferable to be comforted by a falsehood rather than being hurt by the truth. While this statement may seem to offer temporary relief, I don't agree with this proverb.  In the long run, it is always better to confront the truth, even if it may be painful initially. Facing reality and accepting the truth allows us to understand and address problems properly. Ignoring the truth or living in a world of illusions can lead to negative consequences. In some situations, choosing to believe a lie can have serious consequences, such as financial losses or even physical harm.  For example, let's say someone's friend is addicted to drugs, but they keep denying their addiction. If the friend tells them a lie that their behavior is normal or acceptable, it might temporarily make them feel better, but it doesn't solve the problem. Eventually, the truth will come out, and the situation will be much worse than if the friend had been honest from the beginning.  Another example is in a business context. If a company's financial reports are inaccurate, but the CEO chooses to ignore the truth and present them as positive to investors, it can have catastrophic consequences in the long run.  In conclusion, the proverb ""Better a lie that soothes than a truth that hurts"" may provide temporary relief, but it is not a wise or sustainable way to deal with problems. It is better to face the truth, no matter how uncomfortable it may be, and work towards finding a solution.               ",1
"I am a freshman at UT but it is not a new experience for me. My older brother and sister both went here and my brother is still here to help me out which is awesome for me. I see so many confused freshman everyday even though it's already the 3rd week of school and they should know where they're going but they don't. I'm just really glad that it's not me. I am really independent however so this would be a fun experience, not scary, even if I was all alone. I like to look at things as being an adventure instead of a danger. I do go home every other weekend though because my boyfriend, who happens to be my brother's best friend, goes to the Art Institute of Dallas. Dallas is where I am from although it has changed a lot since I first moved there. I can't wait until this Thursday when I can go home to see Greg, my boyfriend again. I have been in serious relationships before but never have I been so much in love. Ever since we starting dating both of us just knew that we were going to be together for the rest of our lives. I can't wait to get done with school, start my job as an elementary school teacher, and be married to the love of my life. As corny and ""Leave it to Beaver"" as that may sound, that is really what I want to do. My real life goal was always just to be a Mom and nothing else. I didn't want a ""real job"" as they're called even though being a housewife is much harder than many highranking jobs out there. But, my dad said that I was too smart to do that and that if one day I just happened to be on my own I needed a good education so that I could have a good job to support myself or my kids with. It actually never occurred to me that I wouldn't go to college until he said that. I wanted to go to college for 4 years, but I guess I was just thinking that I wouldn't have a major but still graduate somehow. I was young then and didn't quite know how this whole college thing worked yet. But, anyhow, here I am and I'm loving it. It is such a refreshing changed from high school where you feel like you are going to a prison every day where they freeze you to death and make you tired as hell. But there was really no possible way to fall asleep because it was always way too cold to relax. So it really was like torture in that it was as if they were filling you full of some sleeping agent but holding your eyelids open for 8 hours. Enough about that though, bad memories. I am here now not knowing quite what to expect. I took summer classes at a really, really easy junior college this summer and have enough credits to be a sophomore when spring semester starts. The faster I get out, the better. But I know that UT is nothing like a junior college in any way. And I also know that no matter how easy a class seems during lecture, the tests are always hard and are nothing to take lightly. Which is good because if this school was easy, I wouldn't learn anything that I would remember longer than the test. But, it also puts a hamper on some of those freshman who expect it to be like high school. They go out on weeknights and party and don't get home until the next morning and then get up for class 3 hours later. And maybe they could pull that in high school and get away with it, or maybe they never did that in high school and are just experimenting with their new found freedom. Either way, they are going to get a big slap in the face when their first test rolls around. But that is their problem and not mine, although life would be much kinder to them if they would have learned that during high school.",0
"I am feeling kind of nervous today because I only have one class and I am supposed to spend the rest of the day at the fraternity house doing chores. I also wonder why I have to do these chores, because all of the actives had to do them when they were pledges?  In any event I know that I have to go over there and it will not be fun. I am also excited because next week my parents are going to come in town and it will be the first time I have physically seen them since I moved down here. Also my cousin is going to be coming down here to visit UT and I am excited that I will be able to see her. People told me that I would be overwhelmed when I came down here but I haven't felt that way yet. Things are getting harder by the week, but I think I am handling it well. My room is a mess and I really need to clean it up and do the laundry. I guess I will today since I will have maybe a little free time.",0
" As an AI language model, I do not hold personal opinions or beliefs, but I can provide some information to help you form your own opinion on the matter.  On the one hand, businesses that offer essays for sale can be seen as legitimate in the sense that they are providing a service that some students may find useful. For example, students who are struggling with a particular assignment or who do not have enough time to complete their homework may find these services helpful.  However, on the other hand, there are several reasons why these enterprises should be shut down. First and foremost, buying an essay from one of these sites is essentially cheating. Students are not learning the material or developing critical thinking skills, which is the main purpose of homework assignments. Moreover, submitting an essay that was purchased online is a form of academic dishonesty that can result in serious consequences, including failing a course or even expulsion from school.  Additionally, many of these essay writing services may not provide high-quality work. Students who rely on these services may end up with poorly written essays that are plagiarized or do not meet the requirements of the assignment. This can be a waste of money for the student and can ultimately harm their academic performance.  In conclusion, while essay writing services may offer a convenient solution for students who do not want to do their homework, they are not a legitimate way to learn and can lead to serious consequences. It is up to individuals to decide whether they want to engage in these practices or not, but schools and universities have a responsibility to prevent and discourage academic dishonesty.       ",1
"  Habits are an integral part of our daily lives, and while some habits are healthy and productive, others can be harmful to our well-being. Whether it is a physical, emotional, or financial habit, it is important to recognize the negative impact it has on our lives and take steps to break it. In this essay, I will convince readers to break the habit of smoking, which is not only detrimental to physical health but also has a significant financial cost.  Smoking is one of the most harmful habits that an individual can develop, and it is also one of the most addictive. Smoking damages nearly every organ in the body and is responsible for a wide range of health problems, including lung cancer, heart disease, stroke, respiratory disease, and many more. Not only does smoking have a significant impact on physical health, but it also affects the emotional well-being of the individual, leading to anxiety, depression, and stress.  One of the primary reasons to quit smoking is the financial cost associated with it. The cost of cigarettes continues to rise, and the habit can quickly become a drain on one's finances. In addition to the cost of cigarettes, there are also numerous hidden costs associated with smoking, including health care expenses, higher insurance premiums, and lost productivity due to illness. By quitting smoking, individuals can save money and use those funds for more important things such as education, travel, or investing for the future.  Another important reason to quit smoking is to improve overall physical health. Smoking damages the respiratory system, making it difficult for the individual to breathe and perform daily activities. Quitting smoking can improve lung function, reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke, and increase overall life expectancy. Additionally, quitting smoking can improve the appearance of the skin, teeth, and nails, and reduce the risk of developing wrinkles and other signs of aging.  Finally, quitting smoking can have a positive impact on emotional well-being. Nicotine is a highly addictive substance that alters the brain's chemistry, leading to feelings of anxiety, depression, and stress. By quitting smoking, individuals can break the cycle of addiction and improve their emotional state, leading to greater feelings of happiness, confidence, and well-being.  In conclusion, smoking is a harmful habit that can have a significant negative impact on physical, emotional, and financial health. It is crucial for individuals to recognize the negative effects of smoking and take steps to break the habit. By quitting smoking, individuals can improve their physical health, save money, and experience greater emotional well-being. It is never too late to quit smoking, and the benefits of doing so are well worth the effort.    ",1
" The statement ""ignorance is bliss"" suggests that not knowing certain information can make one happier. While it may be true that ignorance can sometimes protect us from unpleasant truths, it can also prevent us from making informed decisions, solving problems, and taking necessary actions. For example, not knowing the risks and consequences of a particular decision can lead to poor outcomes and regrets.  Similarly, the statement ""what you don't know won't hurt you"" implies that ignorance can prevent harm. However, not knowing important information can sometimes lead to negative consequences. For instance, not knowing about a health issue or a financial risk can lead to severe consequences.  Therefore, it's essential to seek knowledge and information to make informed decisions and prevent negative consequences, rather than relying on ignorance as a source of happiness or protection.

" However, I can present some information and arguments that can help you formulate your own opinion on whether all students should be required to learn a foreign language before graduating from high school.  Learning a foreign language has many benefits, both practical and cultural. In practical terms, knowing a second language can increase job opportunities and salary potential, especially in fields such as business, diplomacy, and tourism. Additionally, learning a foreign language can enhance cognitive abilities such as memory, problem-solving, and multitasking. On a cultural level, knowing a foreign language can help promote understanding and appreciation of other cultures, leading to increased tolerance and diversity.  On the other hand, requiring all students to learn a foreign language may have some drawbacks. Some students may not have the aptitude or interest in learning a foreign language, and forcing them to do so could cause unnecessary stress and frustration. Additionally, the resources required to provide quality foreign language instruction to all students may not be available in some schools, leading to unequal access to education.  In summary, the decision of whether all students should be required to learn a foreign language before graduating from high school is complex and multifaceted. While there are clear benefits to learning a foreign language, it may not be appropriate or feasible for all students. Ultimately, the decision should be made based on the individual needs and goals of each student, as well as the resources and priorities of each school and community.        ",1
"okay today is friday at 2:25 and at the moment I am wondering what I will be doing this weekend. I am going home on saturday with my best friend. my best friend is catherine, but now she prefers to be called cat. I have known her since I moved to kingwood (north of h-town) 5 years ago. she was my first friend and we have been through a lot together. we've also had our years of separation too. she lives a street away from me. I am listening to the cure. but the tape sucks because I used to listen to it in my car and my car's stereo sucked. now I don't even have that car. we sold it the weekend before I moved to austin. which brings me to the topic of austin. austin always seemed like such a cool place before I moved here. now that I actually live here, I wish I was back in houston. in houston I knew so many people and there was almost always something to do. and most of my friends stayed there. it's really fucking hard to meet people here since there are so many people. ironic. I have not given up yet. I guess I just have to go out more. hey psychology is my fav class. I hate math and chem is just like math to me. I used to like english in high school but now it's goofy stuff like ""everything's an argument"". I bought some ginseng today and I donot think it works. I am still tired. I am looking around my room for things to talk about because thoughts do not pop into my head unless I am looking around. I just remembered I have been having really fucked up dreams. last nite I had my 2nd weird dream. in the first one I almost died and everyone acted really strange. my second dream a lamb was killed in front of me. and there was some blue gel that was everywhere. I can't really explain it and it would take too long and I have only 8 minutes left. since I am a slacker and only do the minimum 20. I drank sobe lizard blizzard today and it was good. I think it was pina colada. right before I did this assignment, someone called and I could not understand them because the were those people who mumble. anyways I thought they were doing a survey so I went ahead and cooperated. well it turns out I was filling a visa credit card application over the phone and she told me I would get my card in a couple of weeks. I thought it was funny because I do not want a credit card and was going to tell her at the end but I decided not to. maybe she will get a bonus for getting a customer. I hope I am doing this assignment right. I did something like this in my high school english class. she had us smell crayons and write the first thoughts that came into our head. and thats what I did except everyone else seemed to have the same thoughts (thoughts about elementary, art school, projects). the crayons did not spark up any thoughts about my childhood. so I hope this writing assignment isn't supposed to spark some certain thoughts. supasticious.",0

I really wish he would tell me how he truly feels about me and about us. I am so frustrated with it all. I be psychologists get a lot of complaints about men from us women. I am really sure of that. I am really realizing that men don't communicate very well about relationships. Unless you are talking about football or cars, you might as well forget. it. I really don't know how to take his comment this weekend that he likes cars better than he likes women. I really take offense to that comment. I really think that that is personally directed to me. I don't know. I know he is not sure about us and I pray all the time that he will know how he feels about things and us, but so far that prayer is sill out there. I really don't know what to do now. I am not trying to make him choose me or hit the road, but I just don't want this to drag on for five years of my life and then end. I just don't want to waste any more time in my life. I know if I would have stayed with my high school boyfriend, we would probably be married by now and maybe even be happy, but things never felt complete with him and I am so glad that I realized that back then. With Stephen, things feel so much more real and I really think that is why things have seemed so much harder. We have been through a lot this past year together. With my whole surgery and illness, he sure was great. A lot of men that might have to deal with a sick girlfriend going through surgery and IV treatments would run and never look back. Not him. Thankfully God gave him the patience to put up with me and stick things out with me and help me get through such a trying time. This past year really has been a trying one. I was in the hospital numerous times, had about 8 inches of my small and large intestines removed, went through a four month new IV treatment and all at the same time tried to find a medication that would help keep my body in remission. I am thankful that I am now in the remission that I have longed for and I think my doctor has found a successful dosage and mixture of medications that are helping keep me stable. God has answered so may prayers and is continuing to watch over me. Being sick has really opened my eyes to a lot and helped me grow so much as a person. I really have had to grow up dealing with such a horrible illness. Its really hard being 21 dealing with a chronic illness that you know there is no cure for and having to deal with it daily, either by pain or medications or doctors. I think I am down to taking about 17 pills a day now. I was taking about 25. Stephen said I would jiggle when I walked. I think I still do. My doctor is continuing to decrease my medications thankfully. Looking at the clock my time is up. Hope this doesn't bore you too much. Take care!",0
"right now I feel somewhat relaxed after having seen one of the most gory movies of all-time. The title of the movie is Event Horizon in which a ship is taken over by evil spirits which have been taken onboard through a dimension warp. My brain feels completely clouded over because I don't really want to start school. I also want to bet on football pretty badly. This past weekend I lost a pretty nice piece of change while none of my teams covered the spread. I hope to do much better this weekend, but it has me worried.

Maybe there is a chance that it will give me problems for the rest of my life. I'm pretty tired right now since it is 1:15 in the morning. I feel I have had a productive day though because I went to class today and got meaningful information from them. Especially in this class. I usually have no sort of interest in scientific things like the brain but the lecture seemed really interesting. I liked the explanations that were given from several things in everyday life. It has also just hit me that Mr. pennebaker said he was from midland, which is also my hometown. I think its a pretty good place, you just have to have a little imagination that's all. I'm thinking that since I ran so much this evening my back might actually be sore because of it. Hell, I dont know though. I could use a nice woman in my life right now, but I am extremely picky unless I've been boozing it a little. It is cold somewhat in my room right now and there are many things that I must take of before tomorrow. I need to do some laundry and do some reading for class.

I need a damn job so I can get some money to pay off some debts and be in good standing with my parents. One thing I've noticed recently is that everyone talks bad about people behind their backs. I mean I've sat down and talked bad about probably everyone I know. People pick out one person's weakness or what they consider to be a weakness and bash them pretty good when they arent around. I know people say stuff about me when my back is turned but hey so did i. I figure its nothing to think about to seriously unless someone is spreading lies. That is bullshit. I've been writing now for 22 minutes Ill stop. is there any that I could",0
" From a market perspective, the high salaries of professional athletes are determined by the laws of supply and demand. The top athletes possess rare and valuable skills, and they are in high demand among fans, teams, and media outlets. Consequently, teams are willing to pay top dollar to attract and retain the best players, and fans are willing to pay for tickets, merchandise, and media access to watch their favorite players compete. In other words, the high compensation is a reflection of the market value of the athletes.  Another argument in favor of high athlete compensation is the short career span of most professional athletes. Unlike many other professions, athletes have a limited window of opportunity to earn money and establish financial security. The average career span of an NFL player, for instance, is less than four years. Given the risks and demands of professional sports, many athletes retire with long-term injuries and health problems that require ongoing medical care. The high compensation, therefore, can be seen as a form of insurance against the financial risks and uncertainties of a short athletic career.  On the other hand, some people argue that the high salaries of athletes are unjustified, given the societal and economic problems that exist in the world. Critics argue that the money spent on professional sports could be better used to address issues such as poverty, healthcare, education, and environmental sustainability. Some argue that the high salaries of athletes contribute to income inequality and perpetuate a culture of excessive consumption and materialism.  In conclusion, the issue of athlete compensation is complex and multifaceted. While there are valid arguments on both sides, the market-driven nature of the sports industry and the short career span of athletes are strong justifications for the high salaries of professional athletes. Ultimately, the question of whether athletes deserve such high compensation is a matter of personal opinion and values, and each individual should consider the arguments and evidence before making a judgment.

"This is the first writing assignment I have had in college. I'm a little nervous. I don't know why I should be worried about this because at least this writing assignment is an interesting one. I've never written in a stream of consciousness. I just lost my train of thought. I tend to do that. Actually, I constantly go off on these tangents as I hold any conversation. It's quite annoying. But hey, it's me. It's about to rain outside. I was just telling a friend about how hilarious it was that everyone noticed that it was raining when one student left early during class yesterday. And Professor Pennebaker was totally right when he said noone was paying attention anymore to what he was saying because we were all thinking, ""How the hell am I going to get home now?"". I laughed for a long time after that, but I was still thinking about the rain. After I ran out of class I noticed a lot of people were prepared, and had their umbrellas with them. I also noticed that the people with these umbrellas who were walking with someone else without an umbrella, did not share their umbrella with the other person. Not one of them. I thought that was extremely odd. I have never used the word umbrella so many times in one sentence. I'm very sleepy now. The rain tends to have that effect on me. I love the rain, not just for that reason but it's also soothing. But I do hate when it rains right before, or when I am about to go out. It's a hassle that I haven't had to deal with for a long time. I'm thinking we are in the middle of a drought. I can't wait until winter either. That time of year makes me happy. I don't know why I keep referring to weather. I'm not one of those, ""It's lovely weather we are having today"", kind of person.",0
" On one hand, some parents might argue that it is their responsibility to monitor their children's internet usage and protect them from potentially harmful content. They may feel that it is their duty to ensure that their children are not exposed to explicit images or dangerous material, which could negatively affect their mental and emotional well-being. Censoring websites with inappropriate content may be a way to limit the chances of children coming across such material.  On the other hand, other parents might argue that censorship is not the best solution. They may believe that children should be allowed to learn and explore on their own, without overly strict restrictions. Moreover, censorship can be difficult to enforce, as there are so many websites and online platforms with varying degrees of control over content. Even if parents manage to block certain sites or keywords, their children may still find ways to access inappropriate material through alternative channels.  Ultimately, it is up to individual parents to decide whether or not they should censor websites with inappropriate content. However, it is important for parents to strike a balance between protecting their children and allowing them to grow and learn independently. Communication with their children about responsible internet usage, as well as the potential risks of accessing inappropriate material, is also crucial in guiding them to make good decisions online. Additionally, there are various tools and resources available to parents, such as parental control software, that can help monitor and limit their children's online activities.       ",1
" A family celebration that has special meaning for me is the annual reunion that we have every summer. This tradition started when I was a child and my grandparents decided to invite all their children and grandchildren to their farm for a week of fun and bonding. It was a way of keeping the family connected and passing on the family’s values, history, and culture1.  Every year, we look forward to this family gathering as a time to catch up with our relatives, share stories, play games, and enjoy delicious food. Some of the activities that we do together are:  Cooking a big barbecue on the first night and having a bonfire with marshmallows and hot chocolate2. Going on a hayride around the farm and visiting the animals. Playing board games or puzzles that we get as gifts from our grandparents2. Watching a movie together on a projector screen in the barn. Having a talent show where everyone showcases their skills or talents. Taking a family photo in matching pajamas that we also get from our grandparents2. These family traditions are very meaningful to me because they make me feel part of a larger community that loves and supports me. They also give me a sense of identity and belonging as I learn more about my family’s roots and heritage. They also create positive memories that I can cherish for a lifetime.  I hope to continue this tradition with my own children someday and pass on the values and culture that I learned from my grandparents. I think family celebrations are important for developing a healthy and happy family unit and strengthening the bonds between generations        ",1
"  On the one hand, some people feel that credit card companies taking advantage of students on college campuses is unethical. Students are often low on cash and may not fully understand the terms and conditions of credit card agreements, which could lead them to accumulate debt they cannot afford to pay off. Furthermore, credit card companies may offer incentives that may be enticing to students, such as free T-shirts or other merchandise, which can be seen as a predatory tactic to lure them into signing up for credit cards.  On the other hand, some people argue that credit card companies offering credit to students can help them begin to build credit and learn financial responsibility. Students who are responsible with their credit cards can start building a credit history, which can help them in the future when they apply for loans or mortgages. Additionally, credit card companies may offer lower interest rates and other perks for students who maintain a good credit score, which can be helpful for them financially.  Overall, whether credit card companies offering credit to students is beneficial or exploitative is a complex issue that depends on individual circumstances. Students should educate themselves on the terms and conditions of credit cards and their own financial situation before deciding whether to apply for credit cards. It is essential to use credit responsibly and pay off balances in full each month to avoid accruing high-interest charges and accumulating debt.         ",1

"Stream of consciousness. What should I write about. Am I supposed to have some kind of direction or am I supposed to write exactly what I am thinking. This feels like a very strange assignment. for homework it seems that it I pretty easy. Actually it would be pretty intense if this was worth more than however much it is worth. Hmm  for some reason I am blanked out, and it seems like I am thinking about nothing. Oh well. Lets see what happened today. I lucked out on my econ quiz, I was actually able to guess my way to a 100. What are the chances of that. having faith definitely pays off. I always say that it is important to have faith. Thats my motto in life. Have faith and have fun. Life is a funny thing. One minute your there and gone the next. It is like Louie the Lug Mcgurg for example. He died tragically at 18. I am 18 what happened. Somebody stepped on his fingers. And that killed him. well he was hanging of the 11th story of the hotel at the time. Poor lug. No Poor Mrs. the Lug. Now she is on the streets selling apples. The point is that the lug did not plan ahead and the government got everything. Oscar was a damn intense movie. It seems very difficult to figure out what I am thinking. Wen I try I blank out, and I keep trying to figure out what stream of consciences s then. Life is good. This entire internet business is pretty cool. I never would of thought I could write a paper, and then send it to a teacher by pushing a submit button. I wonder how much longer I will be writing this. I only have ten more minutes left. Everyone always asks what you are thinking about, when you are just sitting there thinking. Usually you say nothing because you just don't want to tell them. Now I am trying to think of what I am thinking and I am getting nothing. Cricket is a great sport. There is going to be the Sahara cup going to be played in Canada. It is India vc. Paistan. One of the biggest cricketing rivalries in the world. Team Pak is going to be victorious. Aamir sohai is a great Cricketer. I can not believe that they dropped him from the team. Granted he was a little out of form, but he would have taken the Indian crap bowlers around the park and back. This is beginning to seem kind of silly. I hope that was your point. I wonder if any body is actually going to read this. For some reason I doubt it. Whoever is reading it though I feel sorry for. That is a lot peoples garbage talk you have to read. Maybe it isn't. I have no idea what it is. This screen is really weird. How come only three lines have popped up. I have been writing for 15 minutes. Is this some kind of ploy so we can not see what we have written. I can not believe that I only thought about that now. In fact I just noticed that only this much was on the screen. Very Very Interesting. I am getting tired of typing. I am waiting for these final minutes to tick away. I hope you gain something out of this, because I dont think I will. actually I might, but I have no idea how. I was thinking about quitting early, but what if you had some kind of device that told you how long I was on for. That is actually pretty scary. only god knows what technology can do nowadays. Anyway I hope you enjoy reading this. It is quite possible that I have enjoyed writing it. It is fun and relaxing to write something, without having o go back and proofread. It seems like you are an expert typer actually. Anyway now my 20 minutes are up, so have faith and have fun. If you read this give me an A. Even though It does not matter. This completion grade stuff is amazing. All my classes should do it.",0
"Ok well here I am sitting in my dorm room trying to finish this assignment. Earlier today I had called the student financial aid services because all of my financial aid hasn't come through yet. But now they said it should be getting here anytime soon. And one more thing I still need to do is go get a book for my government class because earlier in the week, they had said that it had been ordered although it wasn't there yet. So I'm probably going to have to go later on today. Then my roommate is going to the football game tomorrow morning. I still don't have a sports package and I didn't buy a ticket so this time I won't be seeing the game. I have a paper due for government on monday concerning my political views and where I come from and who or what has influenced me to think that way. I'm still unsure as to what exactly I will be saying. I just have a couple of ideas written down in a piece of paper. Oh man, yesterday some friends and I went to go work out and for some reason my legs are kind of sore right now. We're probably going again today, but who knows. I'm starting to get a little hungry now, I ate breakfast this morning but I'm getting hungry again. Oh I almost forgot, today is my friend's birthday, I need to call him after I finish this assignment. He is back at my hometown, El Paso, but I'm still calling him to wish him a happy birthday. For some strange reason our room always gets real cold. And then our neighbors have the little thing to control the air conditioner but supposedly they can't move it unless we fill in some sort of request. And then other people down the hall complain that it's too hot in their room. I don't know but whatever. My board here in the room looks kinda plain right now. I was initially going to put up some posters a while back, but I ended up doing other stuff and then I would get lazy, so till now the board still looks bare. All I have is one poster on one of the walls here to my right. And then the curtains we put up kept falling at the beginning but we finally got them to stay. All I need now is to actually get the other pictures I wanted to put up already. Oh and then there's my calendar on the wall too, but that's about it. I'm definitely going to finish that this weekend. Last night our neighbors were making a lot of noise and I just couldn't fall asleep. Soon enough I did though. And then I had to wake up early because I have an eight o' clock class, but I managed to do it. So now I'm just here waiting for my roommate to get back from work because we need to go to the store and I need to get a book. Then she said she wanted to buy some jersey for the game on saturday. While I'll be sleeping in, she will be at the game. she can later tell me how the game went, because last time it was raining, hopefully it won't rain again. Now I'm a bit thirsty, I think I'm going to go get myself something to drink from downstairs. Ok that was all for my 20 minutes. finished.",0
"I'm thinking I don't know what to write This popsicle tastes good, I'm really bored, my roommate is gone I'm sitting here in a stupor, not really thinking about anything I'm thinking I miss my girlfriend and I should probably    call her when I am done with this the popsicle tastes good. I hear the  bass from the stereo of person in the room next to me and I think it's  kind of annoying. Tonight is going to be fun, I am looking forward to that, this popsicle is really good. I think I need to clean my room, it's really messy. I need to throw out the food wrappers, put my clothes away, that persons stereo is really annoying, I hear loud voices in the hall, I wonder who they are, it sounds like a cute girl, I need to put my papers and  homework away. I am going to get another popsicle. It tastes good too. I wonder if a m doing this assignment correctly. I am looking around my room for things to think about, but nothing really sparks any interest. I'm really bored. I think I will turn the radio on. Never mind, I think that that might interfere with my stream of consciousness. I hear one of my friends voices outside talking about the start of intramural football with somebody. I can't wait for that to start, but I am upset that I have to play coed instead of men's. This other popsicle is really good too. I feel papers in my pocket and I take them out, its my bank statements. That makes me upset because I see all the things I wasted my money on. I throw them on the floor. I'm thinking  that my time is a little over halfway done, and that makes me feel good because I am looking forward to stop typing this. When I am done I think I will take a shower, and then maybe, I'm thinking about something interesting I can do after that, I'm playing racquetball at 5 so something in between that. I don't know, maybe I can figure something out when my roommate comes back. I'm hungry. Now I'm eating chips. I'm laughing because I'm thinking if you actually read this one you will think I have an obsession with food, which I kind of do but that's just because I am hungry all the time. I really like the chips. I'm kind of sleepy too,  maybe I'll take a nap. I was thinking about typing and how I am good at it and that made me think about my grandpa for some reason because he looks really silly when he types and that made me miss him because I haven't seen him in over a year. Maybe I will call him this weekend   I love chips and salsa, it's damn good. My roommate is going to be pissed because I am eating them all without him. It doesn't matter though because I am really hungry. 2 minutes left I can't wait till this is over, its been interesting but I want to do other stuff. I'm excited though because this counts as a grade and this will be a good start for psychology class. I really like these chips. Well times up and now I'm really happy because I'm done.",0
" There are several reasons why some people may be afraid of sharks. Here are a few:  Media portrayal: Sharks are often depicted in movies and the media as vicious and ruthless predators. These images can create fear and anxiety in people, especially those who have little direct experience with sharks.  Lack of familiarity: Many people have never been in the ocean or have never seen a shark up close. This lack of familiarity with the animal can make it seem mysterious and dangerous.  Personal experiences: Some people may have had negative experiences with sharks, such as being bitten or attacked. Even if these incidents are rare, they can create a lasting fear of the animal.  Evolutionary response: It's possible that our fear of sharks is partly a result of evolution. Our ancestors may have learned to fear large, predatory animals as a survival mechanism, and this fear has been passed down through generations.  Overall, while some fear of sharks may be rational, it's important to remember that they are not usually a threat to humans and that the vast majority of shark encounters end without incident.

"Although, I constantly advocate to my friends that one should make the best of everything, I failed to do so. Recently, I have noticed a drastic change in my life. Prior to the major transition of my life (college), I used to constantly worry. worry. worry. Although I still worry, I have learned to view life from another perspective. Each and every minute I must be productive, but no longer is my school work the only ""productive"" thing in my life. I realized that simply chatting with some friends or relaxing can result into a more elaborate learning experience then simply books. For instance, I was watching a movie last night (something I rarely do because I feel I am not being productive) that enhanced my knowledge of the world around me. Very few movies make me think long after I finished watching the movie, but this one did. The overall design and structure of the movie was not to great, but the plot behind the movie sparked some circuits and made me question particular aspects of life. All in all, I am trying to stress that I am still learning regardless of what I do. This certain attitude towards life has allowed me to be open-minded and not as stressed out as usual. Today, I have several things to do. My priority list is very long, but I am limited with time. It seems the more I think about how much I have to do, the less time I have to do it. I have two tests next week. Chemistry and Calculus, respectively. My weekend is going to be centered around studying for those two tests. Hopefully, my mind will allow me to concentrate on those two tests and only those two tests. Austin, or rather UT, is a very convenient campus. Opposed to my hometown, UT allows me to travel many places on foot or even by bus. This form of transportation is very tempting!  I just bought a laptop which I am very excited about. I felt rushed when I bought it, but it is too late now. I still have to buy a PC card for it so I can access the internet from my dorm. I want to designate a weekend to upgrading and buying software for my computer, but I have so many things on my mind. By the time I get around to doing so, a whole new line of computers will be on the market!!!  My life is busy, hectic, stressful, etc. But, I enjoy it!  I am confused on what organizations I should join here at UT. I am used to being a part of and active in nearly everything I am offered. Here at UT, I am unaware of everything they have to offer and therefore, not a participant in everything I want to join. I hope that I will gradually reach the peak I was at in high school. I am sure I will. I was  unaware of my surroundings a minute ago and this man was asking me a question. whoops. I believe I have reached my goal now, after reading the assignment nearly 20 times.",0
" Arguments for the reading of classical literature:  Cultural literacy: Classical literature provides a foundation for understanding Western culture and history. Many contemporary works draw on themes and motifs found in classical literature, and without knowledge of these works, readers may miss important allusions and references.  Intellectual development: Reading classical literature can help students develop critical thinking and analytical skills. The complex plots, characterizations, and themes found in classical literature can challenge students and push them to think deeply about the world around them.  Literary value: Classical literature has stood the test of time and is still read and studied today because of its literary value. Shakespeare, for example, is widely considered to be one of the greatest writers in the English language, and his works continue to be performed and adapted in various forms.  Arguments against the reading of classical literature:  Lack of relevance: Some students argue that classical literature is no longer relevant to modern life and that contemporary works would be more meaningful and relatable. They may find it difficult to connect with characters and situations that are vastly different from their own experiences.  Inaccessible language: The language used in classical literature can be archaic and difficult to understand, especially for students who are not native speakers of English. This can be a barrier to engagement and comprehension.  Limited diversity: Classical literature tends to be written by white, male authors and may not reflect the perspectives or experiences of a diverse range of people. This can be problematic for students who are looking to explore different perspectives and experiences in literature.  In conclusion, while there are arguments for and against the reading of classical literature in English classes, ultimately it is up to individual educators and schools to decide what works best for their students. A balanced approach that includes both classical and contemporary literature can provide students with a well-rounded education and appreciation for the rich literary traditions of the English language.

" Dear School Officials,  It is my pleasure to offer my opinion on how a recent large donation from an alumnus could be allocated in the most beneficial way for our school. I believe that this sum of money should be invested in improving the school's infrastructure and facilities to enhance the quality of education provided to our students.  To begin with, I strongly suggest that a portion of the donation be used to modernize our classrooms and laboratories. Upgrading the technology and equipment in these facilities will enable teachers to create more dynamic and interactive learning experiences for our students. This will also improve the school's overall academic performance and attract more students and teachers to our institution.  Secondly, I propose that the funds be used to establish a scholarship program for underprivileged students. This will provide opportunities for deserving students who might not have the financial means to attend the school. By offering scholarships, we can ensure that we provide equal opportunities to students of all socio-economic backgrounds, making our school a more diverse and inclusive place.  In addition, I suggest that a portion of the funds be used to enhance the school's extracurricular activities. Activities such as sports, music, and arts programs are just as important as academics in the development of well-rounded students. By investing in these programs, we can offer students more opportunities to discover their talents and develop their skills.  Finally, I recommend using a portion of the donation to create a research fund for faculty members. This will enable teachers to carry out cutting-edge research in their respective fields, which can contribute to the development of new knowledge and ideas. By doing so, the school can enhance its reputation as a center of academic excellence.  In conclusion, investing the alumnus's donation in improving our school's infrastructure and facilities, establishing a scholarship program, enhancing extracurricular activities, and creating a research fund will create a ripple effect that will benefit the school and its community for years to come. I hope that my proposal will be considered seriously and will help guide the allocation of the funds for the greater good of the school.  Thank you for your time and attention.       ",1
" I understand that having money in your savings account may not seem like a priority right now, but I want to emphasize how important it is to create and follow through with a savings plan. Here are a few reasons why:  Emergencies can happen at any time: You never know when you might need extra cash to cover unexpected expenses, such as car repairs, medical bills, or job loss. Having a savings account can give you peace of mind knowing that you have a safety net to fall back on when times get tough.  It can help you achieve your long-term goals: Whether you're saving for a down payment on a house, a dream vacation, or retirement, having a savings plan in place can help you reach those goals faster. By setting aside a little bit of money each month, you can make steady progress towards your financial aspirations.  It can help you avoid debt: If you don't have money saved up, you may have to rely on credit cards or loans to cover unexpected expenses. This can lead to a cycle of debt that is difficult to break free from. By having money saved up, you can avoid going into debt in the first place.  I know that saving money can be difficult, especially if you're living paycheck to paycheck. However, even small contributions to a savings account can add up over time. By creating a budget, cutting unnecessary expenses, and finding ways to increase your income, you can start building your savings account and securing your financial future.  Remember, it's never too late to start saving. Even if you can only set aside a small amount each month, every little bit counts. I hope this encourages you to start thinking about your savings plan and taking steps towards a more secure financial future.  Best regards,                ",1
"Wow this is actually a cool writing assignment. I would have never expected to be asked to sit here at my computer and just write what I am thinking for a 20 minute period. I have just gotten back from a meeting about the Texas Lonestars organization and LOVED it!  The only problem is that I am just a freshman still getting use to the whole college life and time management thing. I am kind of stressed out (but not nearly as bad as I know I can get sometimes) just because I am pre med and I know that I really need to concentrate on my grades and school work while also getting involved. Getting involved, however has never been a problem for me. I love to be involved in everything. Now that is a problem because if I spread myself too thin I am not going to be able to put forth my best in each venue. I know for sure that I want to do something involving dance because it has been such an intricate part of my life for so long and is truly one of my passions. I am going to try out for the Roustabouts and the Steel Dance Company. I am beginning to get nervous just because I haven't really gotten the chance to practice anywhere here since I've been away from home. I hope that I am able to keep my grades really good while also having fun and enjoying my college experience. I know that I am here to get an education, but it's obvious to everyone that college doesn't just teach you knowlege in your courses that are suppose to be preparation for your career, but it's also a learning experience for life lessons. I feel that just in the week and a half that I have been here I have already become more responsible and determined.      It has been kind of hard switching from not only my hometown to a new, huge city, but also from summer and relaxation and the feeling of ""yey school is over"" to ""wow, my life is just beginning, along with lots of studying that I don't really want to do. ""  My life has just been kind of awkward lately anyway. I know that things are suppose to change when you go off to college in so many ways especially through your habits and relationships and mine definitely has. The fact that my family has been going through changes of its own has made me feel somewhat distant and like I don't belong. Yet, the funny thing is that I don't really care or maybe it's that I don't know how to make the effort to fit in again. My first time to go home will be to a different home than the one that I've lived in for the past four years (even though I lived there when I was younger) and I feel like it will just be weird to see how my family's lives have just king of carried on without me. I won't really understand my mom's relationship with the guy she is dating or how my brother is experiencing or enjoying high school. My dad is perhaps the only one that I will probably still feel just about the same with because I am use to not seeing him all the time. My time is almost up and as of right now I am just really hoping that, even though I may not be showing my priority to God right now, he will really just step into my life and help me control it in the right direction.",0
"well, today is a pretty easy relaxaing day. I've kinda gotten into the school mood now so it's not too hard to sit down and get stuff done like it was a couple days ago. when I got here I had no clue it was going to be just what I thought is was going to be like. needless to say, I'm happy. it feels just like a movie or something. I'm so lucky to have such a great roommate. she's so awesome. we knew eachother in high school but we never were great friends so it works out perfect. we always can feel free to go our separate ways and always have someone to come home to and share our nights with. we are so much alike and so much different that God sure put us in the right place. we make eachother laugh. she even hooked me up the other night with one of her friends and I had a great time. we were discussing something last night though. we haven't seemed to find our nitch yet. we've met a lot of people, together and separatly, but I guess it just takes awhile to find your friends huh?  I'm not too worried or depressed about it yet. I'm busy as it is. friends will come. I wish matt from orientation calls me. I think we could be really good friends. I'm pretty upset with some of my friends right now. mainly blake. my old best guy friend. we used to be so tight but now he's changed. all he cares about is partying and drinking and keeping an image. it's so not him and he knows it. he is so much better than that and we've even talked about it before. I just care for him and miss him but both of us are too stubborn to call first and stuff like that. we've always been that way. let me tell you, senior year with him was pretty stressful. I just wish sometimes things were what they used to be. don't get me wrong. I absolutely love college but I guess I miss all of the tight friendships I had and my little group at school. but I love everything about college (except for the showers) :)  well, that's it for now. besides the fact that I wish I had some significant other. or maybe I don't. sometimes I wish I did but I still enjoy looking at other guys and flirting and I'm still meeting people now so I guess it's good I'm not tied down. and I'm really excited I found a theater club I could join here. and I don't have to major in theater. I did a lot of that in high school (hated my teacher) but I was a role model to a lot of people and that made it easier to cope with her. I'm so glad that we have email today. it makes it such an easier way to talk and communicate with people. I miss my friends and family the most. I'm not really homesick yet, which is good I think. I think that shows a sign of maturity. I'm not going home this weekend. I know my parents would want me to but I don't really feel like it yet. I propbably will the next weekend maybe. I know I am for our high school's homecoming for sure. I think that everyone from my school that goes here is going back. I think that it will be fun. I loved high school football games. I went to every single one all four years but two of them my senior year. well, it's been past 20 minutes. until writing #2.",0
" Two people of different interests and backgrounds could become unlikely allies if they share a common goal, face a common enemy, or recognize a mutual benefit. Unlikely allies are those who overcome their differences and cooperate for a greater cause, often in times of crisis, challenge, or opportunity. History and literature are full of examples of unlikely allies who joined forces to achieve remarkable outcomes.  One of the most famous examples of unlikely allies is the alliance between Franklin Roosevelt, Winston Churchill, and Joseph Stalin during World War II. These three leaders represented different political systems, ideologies, and cultures, and had many conflicts and suspicions among them. However, they realized that they had to work together to defeat Nazi Germany and its allies, who posed an existential threat to their nations and the world. Despite their disagreements and mistrust, they coordinated their military strategies, shared intelligence and resources, and negotiated the post-war order. Their alliance was crucial for winning the war and shaping the modern world[^1^][1].  Another example of unlikely allies is the partnership between mPedigree, a social enterprise that fights counterfeit drugs in Africa, and several multinational pharmaceutical companies. mPedigree developed a technology that allows consumers to verify the authenticity of their medicines by sending a code on the package to a free number and receiving an instant response. This innovation has saved many lives and reduced the market for fake drugs. However, mPedigree faced resistance from some drug manufacturers who feared that their products would be exposed as counterfeit or substandard. To overcome this challenge, mPedigree approached some of the leading pharmaceutical companies and convinced them to adopt its technology as a way to protect their brands, increase their sales, and improve their reputation. By collaborating with mPedigree, these companies became unlikely allies in the fight against counterfeit drugs and improved their social impact[^2^][3].  A third example of unlikely allies is the friendship between Huck Finn and Jim in Mark Twain's novel The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. Huck is a white boy who runs away from his abusive father and Jim is a black slave who escapes from his owner. They meet on an island in the Mississippi River and decide to raft together to find freedom. Along their journey, they face many dangers, challenges, and prejudices, but they also learn from each other and grow closer. Huck overcomes his racial biases and sees Jim as a human being worthy of respect and compassion. Jim becomes a father figure and a loyal friend to Huck. They become unlikely allies in their quest for liberty and happiness.  These examples show that two people of different interests and backgrounds can become unlikely allies if they have a compelling reason to do so. Unlikely allies can overcome their differences and achieve remarkable outcomes by working together for a common goal, facing a common enemy, or recognizing a mutual benefit. Unlikely allies can also enrich each other's lives by learning from each other's perspectives and experiences.         ",1
"I really don't have a clue what to write about but I guess I'm supposed to think of what I'm feeling which is that my tank top's straps are really bugging me because they keep falling down and I keep looking at the pictures on my desk instead of the screen and what I am writing my refrigerator keeps making an annoying buzzing sound but I am concentrating on it anyway since I have to keep in touch with my senses. I keep staring at these pictures like I'm afraid to look at the screen or something it is a picture of me and my two friends from high school in our bathing suits acting like morons. there is also a lot of dust on my desk and on the picture frames and I really think I should clean them off, but I am pretty lazy so I doubt I will do that there is dust on everything around my computer!. the printer, the keyboard, the mouse pad, the phone and the pictures. my neck keeps itching; its probably from the dust or something. I can't believe I've only been typing for three minutes. this is going to be a very long paper, but this assignment is definitely a lot more fun than all the other ones in my other classes. uhoh the phone is ringing and I don't know whether to pick it up or not! I guess I can't because that would be breaking the rules! so I didn't and now it stopped and a really loud voice came on the answering machine of course the message wasn't for me I already had my really really good and nice phone calls for the day. I guess you could call me one of those losers that really misses home. I miss my boyfriend and my friends in the picture on my desk and my dad. and I miss my mom, but she's not at home, at least not technically because she's dead. this should be interesting to see where this thought leads because I have noticed in myself that whenever I think about my mom my brain won't let me and it starts thinking about something else like what I will wear tomorrow or something totally irrelevant. my mom was nice and I have a picture of her in my room but I can't really see it from where I am now because it's above my bed it makes me sad to think about her and when I do, like now, it makes me want to cry. I think that my brain realizes I will be too sad when I think about it so it won't let me. that is kind of nice of it, but sometimes when I just want to think about it, it won't let me. now my wrists are hurting from typing so fast for so long and my back is itching and it is getting very hot in here our room is always hot. my mom was always hot and we had to keep our house freezing cold nobody wanted to come to my house in the winter because it was so cold. it didn't matter this past winter, though, because she wasn't alive and I could turn the heat up if I wanted to because no one would yell at me for doing it. My dad would sometimes, but he doesn't really care. He'll yell at me to put on a sweater or something because I am costing him too much money when I can just put a sweater on but my dad is nice, not as nice as my mom, but he wasn't as understanding or shy as her. when she first died he was very understanding about everything but now he is the same as he always was there is a picture of us above my bed that I can see well it is of us dancing at my brother's wedding like ten years ago we were really happy then and we are now, too, I guess he just got married again so there was some tension there but its gone now for the most part, despite what he says. he is in Ireland now with his new wife because that is where she's from and her dad is dying so they went to see him. I liked her dad; he was a funny Irish guy he has cancer; it seems that everyone dies of cancer, although my mom didn't. my mom died because of an incompetent fire rescue ambulance squad and bad cop who will go to hell when he dies, hopefully. it bothers me that I am so bitter about him and the ambulance squad but I can't help thinking that my mom would still be alive if it weren't for them. now I only have five minutes left to go I am extremely itchy I am never this itchy in any other given twenty minutes, I guess its just the stress of actually having to think about my thoughts. the people outside are being so loud and annoying you think that if you were on the ninth floor you wouldn't hear stuff on the ground so far below, but you can. I keep going from staring at the pictures to staring at the screen; I'm afraid to look anywhere else I guess so now I am just sitting here listening to the people outside, enduring my itches, and thinking about how I've almost written a whole entire page on absolutely nothing relevant. I guess some parts were relevant because they made me pay attention to my surroundings and what my brain actually thinks I think it will be cool to go back and reread this. this was a fun assignment except my wrist really hurts now and my arms are sagging like how they tell you not to do on the anticarpel tunnel syndrome commercials and papers. but I only have one minute left now and I can't wait because my wrists are hurting and I don't think they can take much longer. I haven't typed in so long unless you consider email a valuable typing time which I don't because my emails are never a page and some long! ow. ow ow ow. those people are s",0
"I am tired now. I don't know what I should talk about. I like this assignment. Wonder when it's due? Kristi Urey is the most beautiful person I know. I love you. I mean I love her with all of my heart, mind, body, and soul. I like psychology in high school. It was very interesting and personal. That draws people in or so I think. Psychology is the food of the sea. My roommate's a weirdo. He wears a hat to watch Conan O'Brien. My other roommate got his computer from Dell today. I like Kristi. I may not be a smart man, but I know what love is. Someone's going to be sorry, like all you witches and all you slime and all you whitewigged pinheads who make screwing a big crime. You twistedup my life and spit on all my dreams and made me hate myself. Now come on shoot me set me free. I've got a lovely bunch of coconuts standing in a row. I don't like boy bands. I love food. I love my computer. I love the Internet. I have had a computer for four years+. I view myself as an expert in computer engineering. I don't think I can think anymore. My brain's broken. I'm bleeding internally. I'm a nervous wreck. I deserve respect. I'm walking a tight rope without a circus net. I was invited to my first frat party tonight, which I didn't attend. I don't think my girlfriend/fiancee would have liked me to go to that so I didn't go. Cased closed. Time's up!",0
"Okay, I guess this is what all my English teachers described as ""stream of consciousness. "" I believe I did an assignment similar to this in 11th grade. I'm not sure. I wonder how long this writing assignment will be. How much can I possibly type for 20 minutes straight without stopping? What if I get a phone call? Do I answer it? Anyways, I cannot believe I am in my second week of college. It is kind of what I expected. The freedom can me nice at times, but I do miss my home. I do not miss high school at all though. I didn't like high school one bit. I am more homesick than I ever thought I would be, or could be for that matter. I never thought of myself as someone who would get homesick. But here I am, always wanting to call home. Michelle's birthday is tomorrow. I wish I could fly down to spend the day with her. I hope mom remembers to give her the CD I made her. The CD reminds me of Justin, whom I also miss a lot. I miss all my friends, all my best friends. One of which is at UTD, one going to Northwestern in a few days, and one attending Texas Women's. I really wish I could transfer, or they would transfer to UT. I miss them all so much. Wow, it has only been 5 minutes. I don't know if I have 20 minutes of gibberish to write about. This stream of consciousness thing is harder than it seems. I know I tend to ramble on a lot but it is quite different when you are doing it for a class assignment. It is also hard for me because I am so used to typing with abbreviations every time I chat online, making this assignment a lot more difficult. After completing this, I am going to wait for a phone call from my best friend. Then, meet up with someone at the library, where I hope to get a lot of studying done. I feel like I am so behind in all my classes. I have a lot of reading to do. Senioritis has not gone away, and I have yet to get back into the ""homework mode. "" That's not good. I really would like to leave here with a high GPA. I know that is what my parents would really like. Yet, it seems harder and harder as days go by. There are so many things to do here that it seems harder to organize my week. I am usually a very organized person but haven't been as of late. Man, I wonder if Iris is going to call me anytime soon. I feel like I haven't talked to her in forever. I would really like to fly down and stay with her for a weekend. I'm thinking about the weekend of her birthday. Though, I'm not sure if that is a good idea. I need to get the money together first. Oh yeah, I also need to get some money for Lisa's birthday gift. It's her birthday tomorrow. Wow, I wish my friends would chip in money and buy me a camera. That's really neat that Ivy is doing that. I'm so glad I finally got my camera fixed. Stupid battery. How does a battery die out so quickly? I haven't even had my camera for that long. I put up my collages today before lunch. They look really nice on my wall. I think I put them up crooked though. Oh well, I will get used to it, I hope. I would really like to fill up my whole wall with it. That would be so neat! Okay, 6 more minutes. Man, I haven't typed this much in a long time. My eyes are starting to hurt now, and I still have a headache. Today is Monday. Tomorrow is Tuesday. Tomorrow is going to be a very busy day, from beginning to end. I will probably be dead tired by the end of the day and won't have enough energy to study. That will not be good. I want to watch TV. I wonder what is on right now. Lisa said she was going to watch friends and then Roswell. All right, now I am running out of things to type. I don't think my brain works very fast. These last few minutes are going by very slowly. I hope I don't get hungry tonight at the library. I cannot believe I ate so much today at lunch. It is all Leeting's fault. All that starch cannot be good for me. I really hope I do not gain a lot of weight while in college. I'm really scared that I will. I haven't been going to the gym as often as I would like. I think I might start going every Friday or so. Maybe on the weekends too, seeing as how I haven't been in Austin for the weekend since school started. Maybe that is why I still have not put together a regular schedule. I haven't really been here for a full week. Well, this will be my first full week in college. Not as exciting as I thought it would be. I think I might call home after I finish this assignment. I'm almost done, thank goodness. I really am running out of things to type. I think I am all drained out. I hope I do not fall asleep studying tonight. I really need to get stuff done.",0

" Brushing your teeth is an essential part of your daily oral hygiene routine. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to brush your teeth properly:  Choose the right toothbrush: Select a toothbrush with soft bristles and a small head that fits comfortably in your mouth. Make sure to replace your toothbrush every three to four months or sooner if the bristles start to fray.  Apply toothpaste: Apply a pea-sized amount of fluoride toothpaste on your toothbrush. Fluoride helps strengthen your teeth and prevent tooth decay.  Wet your toothbrush: Wet your toothbrush under running water.  Position your toothbrush: Hold your toothbrush against your teeth at a 45-degree angle to the gum line.  Brush your teeth: Use gentle circular motions to brush the fronts, backs, and tops of your teeth. Be sure to brush all surfaces of your teeth, including the outer, inner, and chewing surfaces. Brush your tongue gently to remove bacteria and freshen your breath.  Spit and rinse: Spit out the toothpaste and rinse your mouth thoroughly with water.  Clean your toothbrush: Rinse your toothbrush under running water and store it in an upright position to air dry.  Repeat twice a day: Brush your teeth at least twice a day for two minutes each time, ideally after breakfast and before bed.  Remember to floss your teeth at least once a day to remove plaque and food particles from between your teeth and under your gum line. Additionally, schedule regular dental checkups and cleanings with your dentist to maintain good oral health.        ",1
" Advocates of space exploration argue that the United States should invest more time, money, and effort in this field for several reasons. First, space exploration has the potential to drive technological advancements that can benefit many industries, including healthcare, telecommunications, and transportation. Second, space exploration could lead to new discoveries that could deepen our understanding of the universe and ultimately, our place in it. Third, space exploration could also bring economic benefits through the creation of new jobs and the development of new industries.  On the other hand, critics argue that the United States should not invest more time, money, and effort in space exploration, and instead focus on more pressing issues on Earth. They argue that the money spent on space exploration could be better spent on issues such as poverty, healthcare, and education. Additionally, they point out that space exploration is a risky and costly endeavor, and the potential benefits may not outweigh the costs.  Ultimately, whether or not the United States should invest more time, money, and effort in space exploration is a complex issue with no easy answer. It requires a careful consideration of the potential benefits and costs, as well as an understanding of the priorities and values of society.               ",1
"So yesterday my boyfriend from A&M came down to Austin to celebrate our 9 month anniversary. It was a lot of fun but I stayed up late so I'm pretty tired. I hate that feeling of no energy and I just want to sleep but I know I can't because I am so stressed out. I am still really adjusting to college life. It's is so different from high school and its not all that it's worked up to be. I really like all the freedom, along with everyone else, but I am finding out that its hard to keep up on my studying. I am only taking 14 hrs. , which is supposedly and easy load, but I feel so bogged down. I tell myself I am go into catch up on the weekend and it never happens because other things come up. I have so much I want to do but there are not enough hours in the day. But everyone says this is what a lot of college students feel like and it will take time for me to adjust. I just don't hope it will reflect in my grades. I thought I had a calculus test next Friday, but I came to find out today that it is nest Wednesday. That is really scary. Bit I took calculus my senior year in high school so I feel I know some of the stuff. Everyone studies hardcore for tests, which I am pretty nervous about. I don't really do to much homework in that class because I have so much to do in my other classes. I really hope I'm doing the right thing on this paper and that every other student doesn't type super fast so my paper looks really short and that I didn't try. Anyways, I have a problem with the nest football game which is TX vs. Rice. I didn't realize they sold the tickets so early. I guess the draw started yesterday. I want to go but I haven't really met a lot of close friends to go with. This guy friend from high school wants me to go but I really want to go with a big group of people. I have never been to a large football game. Actually the only games I have gone to have been my high school games. But my high school had like 3,000 people so it was a big school. A lot of the seniors from our school went to A&M because it's only an hour away. I don't know why they would want to go and pass up living in the city like this. I am originally from California, which was so pretty, and Houston isn't the prettiest place in the world. I forgot so sign off instant messenger and people are trying to talk to me. It is getting really annoying. Seems like that is a such a popular way to communicate with people now. I like it but some people are obsessed with it. But I guess I am obsessed with my cell phone. I don't even use any other phone. I am always on it. I think it is so funny when you walk to class and everyone is on  their cells. I feel like I have to take mine to and call someone so of course I do. Plus, walking to class gets kind of lonely. I feel like these thoughts pop in my head and I then I go in a tangent to try to type. But then my mind goes blank for a second. I never really thought I was a good writer. In fact, I thought I was horrible. My teachers never gave me feedback and I never felt comfortable sharing my papers in class. It wasn't until the end of my senior year, my English teacher told the whole class that I was one of the best writers in the class. I really thank her for that because that really boosted my confidence and I feel like I do write well. It almost makes me look forward to writing instead of procrastinating like I do everything else. My critical thinking teacher said that is the number one regret for students after their first semester. I believe him because it is so hard not to procrastinate. I try not to since it's such a bad thing, but I guess it's just human nature.",0
" Impulse buying refers to the act of purchasing a product or service without any prior planning or decision-making. It is an unplanned purchase that occurs in response to an immediate desire or need, often influenced by external factors such as advertising, store displays, or peer pressure. There are several causes and effects of impulse buying, which I will explain below:  Causes:  Emotional triggers: Impulse buying is often driven by emotions such as excitement, joy, or even boredom. An individual may see a product that they feel will provide them with pleasure or make them happy, leading them to purchase it on impulse.  Social influence: The desire to fit in or conform to social norms can also lead to impulse buying. Seeing others around us purchase a product can create a feeling of missing out, causing us to make an impulsive purchase.  Availability and convenience: The ease of accessibility and convenience of a product can also trigger impulse buying. When a product is readily available or easy to purchase, an individual may be more likely to buy it on impulse.  Effects:  Financial impact: Impulse buying can lead to overspending, resulting in financial strain. Individuals may spend money they don't have or go over their budget, which can lead to debt and financial instability.  Regret: After the initial excitement wears off, an individual may feel regret or guilt over their impulsive purchase. This feeling can be heightened if the purchase was expensive or unnecessary.  Clutter: Impulsive purchases can lead to clutter and a lack of organization in one's space. Unnecessary items may accumulate, making it difficult to find and use the things we actually need.  In conclusion, impulse buying is often driven by emotional triggers, social influence, and convenience. However, the effects of impulse buying can be financially damaging, create feelings of regret, and lead to clutter and disorganization in one's space. It's important to be aware of these causes and effects and make deliberate and conscious purchase decisions.  ",1
"Today is Friday and I am feeling sad because my I had been hoping to see my boyfriend Justin this weekend. Actually, originally I had planned to see him next weekend because this weekend he was supposed to be going to La Grange. But then his trip to La Grange got cancelled and I was hoping that he would be able to come up and visit me. But it just wasn't going to happen in this short of notice because we had too many other things going on this weekend. But next weekend I will see him because I am driving down to Houston next Friday. I am so excited because by then it will have been three weeks since we last saw eachother. Next Sunday, September 15 is his brothers' birthday. He has two brothers, they are twins. Their names are Jack and John. They will be turning 11. This weekend I am going to buy them birthday cards. The only problem is that I'm not sure which name to put on one of the cards because now John wants to be called Hunter for no particular reason. So I want to be nice and call him by the name he wants to be called, but I also think that those kind of nicknames are dumb. By that I mean nicknames that are derived from nowhere. A nickname should contain at least some semblance of the person's actual name. But I want to be nice to his brother. I am very tired right now. I didn't get enough sleep last night, I stayed up late talking to my roommate about the most random stuff. I had planned to take a nap after my 10:00 class, but I got sidetracked, and I had that guilty feeling that I should be studying. So I went to the library and studied a little bit. And now it is 3:00 on Friday afternoon and I really have nothing to do. That has been a common theme during my two-week college experience so far: having nothing to do. My roommate is one of my best friends from high school, and all senior year we were so excited about coming to college. And I really like it here a lot, but I guess it takes awhile for things to pick up. But I have been meeting a lot of people in the dorm and some people in my classes. At first I was unbelievably homesick, it came in waves. I'd be ok for awhile, and then all of a sudden something would remind me of Justin or home or my parents or something and I'd feel like I wanted to cry. Now that things have settled into sort of a routine I feel better. And I know it just takes time. I can sort of gauge everything that happens to me during college to what happened to my brother, because when he started college he was in the same situation I am in - he was in a long distance relationship. But he went to A&M. Also, his girlfriend was still in high school, and my boyfriend is the same age as me. But he was miserable, I remember how sad he was. He used to come home every weekend. But he was in College Station, only about an hour from home. Anyways, I wouldn't even want to be like that. I don't want to seem like I can't handle things and I have to run back to Justin all the time. But I really miss him and I have this lost feeling, like I'm not sure what to do with myself. My roommate went downstairs to get her laundry. She had a little package slip in the mail too. Justin said that I should check my mail today and I did, but I didn't get anything, so I don't know what he's talking about. It's a very cloudy day today. I am supposed to do this homework assignment for my astronomy class where I have to observe the sky and measure the angles of different stars. So I hope it clears off later. The other problem is I can't find a place from where I can do it. At first I thought I would just go to the top of the Jester parking Garage, so I did that last night, but it wasn't tall enough - I couldn't see the horizon behind all the tall buildings and stuff. So I'm not sure exactly what I'm going to do about it. It is actually stressing me out, because I just don't know what to do. I hope I will figure out something this weekend. The homework is not due until Thursday. But I'd rather get it over with. My roommate just came back and said that I did have a letter from Justin. That is weird because I checked the mail earlier and there was nothing for me. So I'm excited now. Now she is folding her laundry. I did my laundry yesterday. It is so expensive, 75 cents a load. That is why I'm going to take my laundry home next weekend.",0
"Ok, I've just turned off the news so the thing that I have on my mind right now is the up and coming election. I really can't stand Gore, he is so robotic, I don't understand how anyone can stomach looking at him or listening to him. Now I am debating whether or not to get up and turn off the television or if I should just sit here and listen to the noise annoy me. Well I have decided to turn it off, ok that's much better, now I can write a more accurate account of what I am thinking. I really don't know what to write, I have never done anything like this before. My computer is really getting on my nerves because it isn't fast enough to keep up with my typing, and I can't stand all the little red squiggly lines that show what all I have misspelled thus far. I don't like not being able to fix it, and now the phone is ringing and that really bothers me because it breaks my concentration even more. Well it turned out to be a wrong number, someone looking for Heidi, I know this because my roommate had to answer on speaker phone, now it is ringing again and it was that girl that had the wrong number, this time she just hung up. What a moron, I mean really how much guts does it really take to fess up and say that you were dumb enough to dial the same wrong number twice? Not saying that I haven't done it before because I most definitely have but I also told the person I was sorry for interrupting them twice. My computer is really getting on my last nerve. I feel like asking my dad to buy me another one. Now that I have said that it reminds me about how everyone always says what a spoiled brat I am for getting everything that I want. I don't think its my fault that my dad loves me so much. I think that my brothers do though. Speaking of brothers, I rode out with my brother Eric yesterday and that was really fun. I think that if I wasn't so caught up in money and status I would become a paramedic instead of a doctor. Oh well maybe I'll become an ER doctor. That would be pretty cool. I just watched ER tonight and it was pretty good. Mark Green reminds me of Eric's friend Jim, he's really nice but he is married to a psycho just like Eric is. I used to want to be a psychiatrist but after last night I defiantly don't want to do that. We ran a call on a girl that over dosed on her anxiety medication. All she did was whine about how no one loved her and all of her friends had boyfriends, just like Sunni. Sometimes I wish that I could be a writer like JD Salinger. He is really awesome. I know that this sounds really morbid but I almost can't wait for him to die so that we can read more of his work. And if that sounded bad another person that could keel over at any given moment is ""Deep throat,"" from the Nixon scandal, I would really like to know who that is. I really don't want these people to die, I mean I wouldn't wish that on anyone, I just would like to find out some more things. Oh well I have about two more minutes and I can stop writing this. I'm glad that no one is going to read it because that would be really embarrassing. I can't believe how much stuff I am misspelling. It's like I never attended first grade. Well I did fail spelling in the fifth grade but doesn't that make me a genius?",0

"Its hard to start anywhere I guess I feel like I'm being analyzed   for what I'm writing, but I know that it doesnt mean anything, that   twenty minutes of writing can't really say everything about me. class   somewhat worries me, I know I've taken 7 some odd AP classes yet   i still don't feel like i'm prepared, i just have to stay focused, i hope   that doesnt bother taylor to much but he's just going to have to learn   that it takes me a while to study and that has to come first. Its a sad   thought really, that studying has to ever come first in life, isnt all you'll   ever know what you truly experience, won't you only find happiness in   yourself and other people? so why study so much on things that   tend to affect you so little, why don't we interact more, shouldnt we be   put into groups of people with different backgrounds and cultures,   learn understanding and acceptance, that would save more   problems. The worst battles are those that come out of ignorance,   and people learn how to float the system of books and test, but it   would be harder to ignore real human interaction, there seems to be   so much misunderstanding in the world simply because people   don't interact and learn who's really out there, so much of humanitys   misery could be qualmed if only people spent time physically   interacting with humanity. Its easier to disregard a text than it is to   disregard a human. but i suppose not very many people see it that   way. I wonder if this is where im supposed to be or if there is some   greater plan out there for me, i wish i knew, but i guess thats life, the   suprise of the future, the unknow of the big picture, everyone goes   through it I suppose i just have to as well. I'm tired of pouring out my   thoughts to a page, i want to talk to people, people who think like   me, i think Maya Angelou is the most amazing person ever, her   attitude toward people is superfluous with love. she just is the most   beautifully person inside and out, she is a role model for the way to   look and society and people, i hope to gain a lot of the knowledge   that she has. I'll just keep reading her books, i need to check out the   library and see what else they have, too bad i never have time to   read what i want to and what really enhances my life because im   stuck reading textbooks for hours. I hope i get to join the crew team it   will be really exciting if im actually around athletic people, maybe it   will get me off my butt, lord knows i need to. oh well, 15 minutes   done, gosh that flew by, it was a nice writing assignment, i wish we   could have more like that. This   open your door    thing next week is   going to fabulous im exciting about people stopping by and meeting   everyone on our floor. i swear that the strangest thing, its the second   time I've switched the words our and hour, and not in the same way   either, very odd. tonights going to fun watching the football game, i   hope taylor enjoys himself tonight, it makes me so mad when hes   upset about social surroundings, oh well he'll learn. i guess i have   to get ready soon to go watch the game, i seem to always be   running behind, i'll catch up soon enough, i hope my package from   apple computer comes soon, im excited about my new adaptor silly   really to get excited but what the hey, might as well enjoy life",0
"There's a picture of the two of us up on my bulletin board. It's right behind my computer where I can see it when I'm working. I look at that picture and remember my past. I remember a time when I thought that things were different than they really are. I don't think anymore that it was anyone's fault, either hers or mine, that is. I respected her so much though, and it hurts to be let down by someone you think so highly of. In the picture, I look so innocent and young, in my white cheerleading skirt, and the royal blue shell with Eagles written across it. Her arm is around my shoulder, and she's holding her sunglasses in her hand. I recall that she had just taken them off before we took the picture. There are people in the background behind us, and the gym is visible. I remember how beautiful the day was; it was so crisp and blue and wonderful. It's hard to tell, and I've wondered many times, what exactly she was thinking when we took that picture together. When I look at the face, the eyes especially, sometimes I see something warm and trustworthy. Other times I'm sure I see something sinister and strange. I don't know why I still struggle with this issue so much. I've never really gotten over it. I went into this assignment knowing that I wanted to write about Carla because in class, I heard something said about how writing about something can change your opinion or the way you look at something. Well, it is true that I'm noticing things about the picture, minute details, that I didn't pay too much attention to before. But her face and her eyes are still an enigma to me. I can't explain in words how much I want her to care about me, to love me, and to think I'm something special. I want to tell her everything that I've done today and yesterday and since I arrived here. But she's back home, and I'm here, and there's something ominous to me about writing her an email. I don't know why. I miss her so much. She was there when I really needed someone. I see now more and more, that this was mostly situational. It's not like she planned to be in that room when my whole world fell apart. But she was. And she told me how to get through it, and she cared. More than any person has ever cared about me on this earth, at least that I'm aware of. The picture is truly beautiful, even though it's more than 5 years old. The light is in our hair, coming from behind, and our faces are bright and illuminated. The beauty of the day is apparent. I just feel like something needs to happen between us. There was never any closure for me, or continuation. Our relationship just sort of drifted off and never returned, and now I don't know where we are. I saw her by chance before I left for college at church because we are making a new church pictorial, and her family happened to be getting their pictures done on the same night as our family. I was very surprised to see her, and I know my heart skipped a beat. I hadn't seen her in such a long time. probably since before school let out for the summer. The truth is, I was a little bit upset with her for not being around. But she was nothing but warm and kind to me. I don't know why she always does that. I see her, and it's like I'm the whole world. But then when we're apart, I don't hear a peep. I don't understand our relationship sometimes, and it's very hurtful to me to analyze her possible motives. Anyway, she hugged me, and touched me, and stood close to me, and made me promise to keep in touch when I'm gone. She even promised to make me some chili or something when I come back and come over to her house. I fear that that's an empty promise, like so many of the others. But at the time, it was easy to believe her. I really think it's something to do with her eyes. You have never seen anyone with such power behind their gaze. She is so earnest with her eyes, but so untruthful with her actions. It confuses me to no end. I don't even know why I brought the picture with me, or why I decided to place it in such an obvious place where I can always see it. But I did. I guess my hopes die hard. I still hope that maybe she really does care about me. Maybe she really does think I'm special. Maybe, she does even really love me. I don't know what to believe. I think maybe this evening when I have some time to myself, I'll write her that email that I've been meaning to. I think maybe I could even get up the courage to be totally honest with her, and get everything out in the open. Well, maybe that's a little too unrealistic, but maybe I can begin to open it up for discussion. I think it would be very good for me to do so. I want to know what's really behind those eyes. I've got to know about the truth. I really desire to understand the enigma. My dear Carla.",0
" Here is a possible essay on a major environmental problem and what I believe should be done about it.  One of the biggest environmental problems of our time is climate change, which is caused by the increase of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere due to human activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, agriculture, and industrial processes. Climate change is affecting every aspect of life on Earth, from ecosystems and biodiversity to human health and well-being. It is also exacerbating other environmental problems such as water scarcity, soil erosion, pollution, and food waste.  Climate change is a global challenge that requires collective action and cooperation from all countries, sectors, and individuals. There is no single solution to this problem, but rather a combination of mitigation and adaptation strategies that can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and enhance resilience to the impacts of climate change. Some of the possible solutions include:  Switching to renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal power, which do not emit greenhouse gases and can provide clean and affordable energy for all. Implementing carbon pricing mechanisms such as taxes or cap-and-trade systems, which can create incentives for reducing emissions and investing in low-carbon technologies and practices. Promoting energy efficiency and conservation in buildings, transportation, industry, and households, which can save money and reduce energy demand and emissions. Restoring and protecting natural ecosystems such as forests, wetlands, grasslands, and oceans, which can store carbon, provide habitat for wildlife, regulate water cycles, and offer other ecosystem services. Adopting sustainable agriculture and land use practices such as organic farming, agroforestry, crop rotation, and soil management, which can enhance soil fertility, biodiversity, food security, and carbon sequestration. Reducing food waste and loss along the supply chain from production to consumption, which can save resources, money, and emissions. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), about one-third of all food produced for human consumption is wasted or lost every year1. Supporting climate adaptation and resilience measures such as early warning systems, disaster risk reduction, social protection, climate-smart infrastructure, and community-based initiatives, which can help vulnerable people and regions cope with the effects of climate change such as droughts, floods, heatwaves, storms, sea level rise, and diseases. Climate change is a serious threat to the environment and humanity that cannot be ignored or delayed. It requires urgent action from everyone at every level. By implementing these solutions and others that are appropriate for different contexts and needs, we can mitigate climate change and adapt to its impacts while also achieving other social, economic, and environmental benefits.

" One team sport that interests me is basketball. Basketball is a fast-paced game that involves two teams of five players each, who try to score points by shooting a ball through a hoop at either end of the court. The game requires skill, teamwork, strategy, and endurance.  Basketball was invented in 1891 by James Naismith, a Canadian-American physical education teacher who wanted to create a sport that could be played indoors during the winter. He used peach baskets as the goals and a soccer ball as the ball. The original rules had 13 items and did not include dribbling or fouls1.  Basketball has become one of the most popular and widely played sports in the world, with millions of fans and players of all ages and levels. The sport has also evolved over time, with new rules, equipment, techniques, and styles of play. Some of the most famous basketball players include Michael Jordan, LeBron James, Kobe Bryant, and Shaquille O’Neal.  Basketball is a sport that can be enjoyed by anyone, regardless of their height, gender, or background. It can be played for fun, exercise, or competition. It can also teach valuable lessons about teamwork, discipline, respect, and sportsmanship. Basketball is a sport that challenges both the body and the mind. ",1
" Hazlitt's statement suggests that humans have a natural inclination to act out their roles, and this is where they feel the most comfortable and genuine. From my perspective, there is some truth in this statement. People are social animals, and as such, they tend to adopt various roles in their interactions with others. These roles can be influenced by different factors, such as cultural background, social class, and personal preferences.  For example, a person who works in a corporate environment may adopt a professional persona at work, which involves wearing formal clothes, using formal language, and following established rules of conduct. This role may feel natural to the person because it aligns with their professional goals and aspirations. Similarly, a person who is a parent may adopt a nurturing and caring persona towards their children, which reflects their desire to provide a safe and supportive environment for their family.  However, while it is true that people adopt various roles in their lives, it is not necessarily the case that they are never truly themselves outside of these roles. People have multifaceted personalities and can express different aspects of themselves in different situations. Moreover, there are times when people feel the most genuine and authentic when they are not acting out any particular role. For example, when a person is alone, pursuing a personal interest, or spending time with close friends or family, they may feel the most comfortable and true to themselves.  In conclusion, while it is true that humans tend to adopt various roles in their interactions with others, it is not accurate to say that they are never truly themselves outside of these roles. People have multifaceted personalities and can express different aspects of themselves in different situations. Therefore, it is essential to strike a balance between adopting roles and being true to oneself.            ",1
" On the one hand, increasing the speed limit can save time and increase efficiency for motorists traveling long distances on highways. It can also lead to increased economic productivity by reducing transportation time for goods and services. Furthermore, many modern cars are designed to operate safely at higher speeds, so there may not be a significant increase in accidents or fatalities as a result of higher speed limits.  On the other hand, there are potential risks associated with increasing the speed limit. Driving at high speeds reduces the reaction time of drivers, making it more difficult to avoid collisions or react to unexpected events. Moreover, higher speeds increase the force of impact in a crash, which can lead to more severe injuries or fatalities. In addition, some roads may not be designed for higher speeds, leading to increased wear and tear on the road surface and infrastructure.  In conclusion, while there may be some advantages to increasing the speed limit on highways, it is important to carefully weigh the potential risks and benefits before making any changes. If higher speed limits are implemented, it is crucial to ensure that adequate safety measures are in place to minimize the risk of accidents and injuries.                  ",1
" I do not have personal beliefs or opinions, but I can provide information and arguments that can help you make an informed decision. There are several arguments for and against becoming a vegetarian, so I will present some of them below:  Arguments for becoming a vegetarian:  Health benefits: A vegetarian diet can be very healthy, as it typically includes a lot of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. This can lead to a lower risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, and some types of cancer.  Ethical considerations: Many people choose to become vegetarians because they object to the treatment of animals in the meat industry. They believe that it is wrong to kill animals for food and that they should be treated with respect and compassion.  Environmental concerns: The meat industry is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions and deforestation. Choosing a vegetarian diet can be a way to reduce your carbon footprint and help protect the planet.  Arguments against becoming a vegetarian:  Nutritional concerns: A vegetarian diet can be low in certain nutrients, such as iron, vitamin B12, and protein. It is important to make sure you are getting enough of these nutrients through other sources, such as supplements or fortified foods.  Taste preferences: Some people simply enjoy the taste of meat and do not want to give it up. They argue that a vegetarian diet can be bland and unappetizing.  Cultural traditions: In some cultures, meat is a central part of the cuisine and giving it up can be seen as a rejection of those traditions.  Ultimately, whether or not to become a vegetarian is a personal choice that depends on individual beliefs, values, and priorities. It is important to weigh the pros and cons and make an informed decision that works for you.   ",1
"I have never been asked to do anything like this before. It is actually hard to think of anything to think about when you are asked to. This class seems as though it is going to be very interesting. Many people act in strange ways. Maybe this class will help me better understand that. I have a friend that acts in strange ways. Well, actually he use to be my boyfriend. It is so intersting to sit back and watch how he reacts to different things. He sometimes is so hateful and so mean to people for no reason. He has said so many mean things to me and the next day he is sorry for acting the way he did. But the funny thing is, he always ends up doing it again. My dad is somewhat the same way. But he seems more like he has a split personality. It is sometimes very scary. He can just snap sometimes and be a totally different person then he really is. Most of the time it is for no apparent reason. Maybe him being a heavy drinker has something to do with it. I also have a friend that doesn't know how to deal with her emotions too well. She goes literally crazy sometimes. One time I didn't answer my cell phone, and she left the most hateful voice mail. If you would have heard it, you would have thought she was crazy too. But when i confront her about it, she says sorry and can't explain why she did it. I seem to always be stuck in the middle of everything. No matter who is involved or what the situation is, my name always some how pops up. It is pretty aggrivating actually. And I have always lived my life to my dads standards. I never really get to worry about pleasing myself, because i always have to worry about pleasing my dad. My dad wanted me to be a cheerleader. So of course i worked my butt off to become one. He also wanted me to get in to UT. Don't get me wrong, i love it here. But the more i do want he wants the more he ask of me. None of his other children are asked to live up to his standards.",0
"9 on the West Campus bus- please let me know if this will be a problem with the requirements of the assignment.  So what is this supposed to tell you?  Are all of my little Freudian hang-ups going to show themselves in my ""stream of consciousness"" writing?  ""There are no right or wrong answers""?  fine. I am constantly amazed by the blank looks on other peoples' faces when I pass them on the street or sit next to them on the bus-- are they really that dumb or do they just do an excellent job of faking it?  I sound like a big asshole, I know, but really, watching other people is my thing. lately, I guess they've just been frustrating me. I try to pick at least one person everyday and try to figure out as much as I can just by watching them. I'm probably way off base, and I don't presume to know everything about everyone just because I spend a while watching them scratch their heads and play with their hair on the bus never mind, I'm sick of this line of thought. I like to draw I play the clarinet and the piano I have a boyfriend named Zach and a dog named Simon-- sometimes they're similar  I wonder how flammable my dorm room is. I wonder how long it would take the chicks on my hall to realize someone is barbecuing in their room. the frat boys are having a shindig of some sort outside my room and I wonder what the significance of the word WOO is- they say it all the time. I used to think I was an alien and sometimes that comes back to me I used to think a lot of things because I had way too active an imagination when I was a kid-- this is something no one should combine with drug use and I figured that out pretty quick sometimes Zach really annoys the shit out of me-- if I'm an alien, so is he- just another galaxy he thinks I'm a bad driver and this just makes me want to cross big lanes of traffic and slam into a concrete wall just to prove what a bad driver really is. I also remember too much I don't like my fingernails much I wish I could play the guitar  I also wish I could make a perfect clay figure of my head so I'd know what it looks like to talk to me has it been twenty minutes? no. I'm looking at a screen full of garbage- how am I ever going to write a manifesto that will capture the imagination of the world and rocket me into super powerdom. if that's even a word. I do want to rule the world- a lot of people say that, but I really mean it my goal is to achieve greatness the only problem is that I have no idea how to even begin or what greatness even means to me I want to subsist on pomegranates entirely I have a really good relationship with my brother- he's really cool I had a dream that I could fly like a beetle I bet you don't even read this, do you?  so I could say that I want to kill the president or burn down the tower and it would go unnoticed?  I think the tower should be coated in Vaseline.",0
"Right now I'm a little bit depressed, not much has gone my way this week. I made some fabulous friends last week and we were all planning on going home together tomorrow, but now they seem not to want me to go with them. I don't know why everyone is getting mad all of the sudden, maybe it's something in the air. quite ridiculous, if you ask me. I have tears in my eyes as I'm typing, which is strange because I have tried so hard to not let little things get to me. My mom has always told me that I was overly sensitive, I thought I could overcome it, I think I can overcome anything. I had Mono a few years ago, and I overcame that one. My mind has not been forced to think in a while, people that I've talked to are just not to stimulating, I guess I should go and hang out in a coffee shop or something. I always thought college was going to be so much fun, and it's really not. I am this close to packing my bags and going home. Last week, I was the stereotypical college student and now, definitely not. My roommate and I are just not compatible, I mean she's a nice girl and all and she has good intentions, but I find her incredibly dull and childlike. She is a sophomore and I am a freshman. She has a really low self esteem and that's something that I don't deal well with, because I used to too. I don't like to think about those times, because I've overcome them. I fear that she is what I will become and it makes me resent her a bit. I don't want to live the life, or lack thereof, that she is leading. I make my life incredibly competitive, and I like to win. My cousin is down here, she rushed, she's actually in this class. But we've competed with each other all of our lives, whether the other one realized it or not, driving home, getting ready, meeting guys, they were all competitions. She and I are both incredibly stubborn too, so we butt heads quite often. I know that I've changed this year, and she has too, but we've changed differently. She's become more and more dependent on people, she can't be alone at all and I've become more and more independent of folks, for instance tonight, I walked over to the turtle pond and fed the fish, Carrie would freak out if someone told her to do that alone, but I really enjoyed myself tonight, I haven't felt that quiet peace in a long time down here. I don't know if UT is the right place for me, and I don't know. This is ridiculous. I'm here, and I'll graduate from here. Is this the sort of paper you're looking for? My mind is definitely not in a deep ponderous mood. This his how my mind works, worry after worry. I'd rather not get too far into myself here, if that's alright. On a happy note, I saw a guy in my Philosophy class today with absolutely Amazing hair. It was bleach blond and had four inch spikes! I admire people being gutsy enough to do that, never in my life would my hair be in spikes or fuchsia, I'll just stay the way I am. I miss my dog. I talked on the phone to my parents last night and I heard her bark in the background. I am ready to go home that's pretty much what has gotten me through this week. It has been the first time that I've gotten homesick. I think it's because I am going home tomorrow. Before, I didn't get homesick because I didn't allow myself to think about it too much, but I saw a Dallas Morning News today and got all choked up. What is all of this about anyway? Where do I benefit in the long run of living with someone I don't like and being forced to eat bad food? I'd much rather be in my own apartment. HA! My folks would really go for that one. They are so overprotective. The people that I was originally going home with are going to the Dave Matthews concert, and my mom won't let me go, I'm also not allowed to go to the TX v. OU game. That is stinky! I just need a good cry and a good nap and a hug from my grandma and everything will be fabulous again. I swear! If my roommate asks one more time if I want to talk about anything that's bothering me I will scream. I told her already that I'm writing a paper and she is still jabbering. Okay, Deep Breath. Back to Grandma. She is the cutest old lady in the entire world. She is definitely a cookiecutter grandma. It's fabulous. I told her I was coming home and she got so excited! My twenty minutes are up, but I feel much better now, I'm glad I got to take all of my emotion out on this essay rather than on my roommate! I don't know quite how to end my thoughts, even though I am 99. 99% sure that no one will ever read this.",0

"Is U. T. for me? Should I have stayed with my friends in Houston? I thought I was going to meet to meet a lot of new people here. I don't know what to do? Why am I here? I don't even know what I want to be. Is college even for me? I hate that song. I think I could be happy with a low paying job. I don't know. People here are different; maybe it's just me. College is supposed to be the best time. I over think everything. I should just go with the flow. Everyone tells me you will love it here once I meet a few people, but it seems unlikely. I have met a lot of new cool people, but I can't see them being as close as my friends back home. Even the girls here act differently. I have meet a lot of new girls, but it wasn't what I expected. It seems like I'm the only one who feels this way. I know I over think everything. Maybe I'm not giving U. T. a chance. I think I'm trying, but I feel awkward here. I worry way too much. I don't know why I always think about this. That music is loud. I hate complaining like this, its useless, but it's all I think about. Who knows maybe I'll meet new people when I go to I. S. A. tonight. But I know it's going to be like everything else, you might meet new people but you will never see them again or get to know them. I'm so glad I am going home this weekend.

" Argument for expanded science requirement: Science education is critical for students to develop critical thinking, problem-solving, and analytical skills that are essential for their future careers. In today's technology-driven world, science is increasingly important in many fields, including medicine, engineering, and computer science. Therefore, it is important for students to have a strong foundation in science to prepare them for these fields. By expanding the science requirement in secondary schools, students will have the opportunity to take more science classes, and thus, gain a deeper understanding of science concepts and develop a greater appreciation for the importance of science in their lives.  Argument against expanded science requirement: While science education is important, expanding the science requirement may not be the best way to achieve this goal. Students have different interests and career aspirations, and requiring them to take more science classes may not be the most effective way to engage them. Additionally, some students may struggle with science classes and may feel discouraged from pursuing science-related careers if they are forced to take more science classes than they are comfortable with. Instead of expanding the science requirement, schools should focus on improving the quality of science education and offering more science electives that cater to different interests and abilities.  In conclusion, whether an expanded science requirement in secondary schools is a good idea or not depends on various factors such as the quality of science education and the interests and abilities of the students. It is important for schools to strike a balance between providing a solid foundation in science education and allowing students to explore their interests and passions.          ",1
" The search for extraterrestrial life has fascinated humans for centuries. While some people believe that we are alone in the universe, others are convinced that life exists beyond our planet. In my opinion, it is very likely that there is extraterrestrial life in the universe. In this essay, I will provide evidence and arguments to support my point of view.  Firstly, the vastness of the universe makes it highly probable that there are other forms of life out there. According to recent estimates, there are over 100 billion galaxies in the observable universe, each containing billions of stars. The idea that Earth is the only planet in this vast expanse of space that can support life seems unlikely. Given the sheer number of potential planets out there, it seems almost certain that some of them are capable of hosting life.  Secondly, scientists have discovered many planets that are similar in size and composition to Earth. These exoplanets are located within the habitable zones of their respective stars, meaning that they receive enough heat and light to potentially support life. One example is the exoplanet Kepler-452b, which is often referred to as Earth's ""cousin"". It is roughly the same size as Earth and orbits a star similar to our Sun. While we have not yet discovered any direct evidence of life on Kepler-452b, the fact that such a planet exists raises the possibility that other Earth-like planets could also be out there.  Finally, the discovery of microbial life on other planets or moons in our own solar system is not out of the question. There are several places in our own solar system that could potentially harbor life, such as Europa, one of Jupiter's moons. Europa is believed to have a subsurface ocean that could contain more than twice the amount of water found on Earth. If there is microbial life on Europa, it would be the first evidence of life beyond our planet.  In conclusion, the vastness of the universe, the discovery of exoplanets, and the potential for microbial life in our own solar system all point to the existence of extraterrestrial life. While we have yet to discover definitive proof of life beyond Earth, the evidence suggests that it is highly probable. As we continue to explore the universe, we may eventually find the answers we are looking for.                  ",1

" It's important to consider the pros and cons of different security measures to create a safe learning environment for students.  On one hand, having security guards and equipment like video cameras and metal detectors can deter potential threats and provide a sense of safety for students and staff. These measures can also help identify and address issues like bullying or drug use on school grounds.  On the other hand, some argue that the presence of security measures can create an atmosphere of fear and mistrust, which can negatively impact the learning environment. Additionally, relying solely on security measures may not address the root causes of safety issues in schools, such as mental health and access to firearms.  Ultimately, the approach to security in public schools should balance safety concerns with the need for a positive and inclusive learning environment. This may involve a combination of security measures and other initiatives, such as mental health resources and conflict resolution programs, to address underlying issues that contribute to safety concerns in schools. Additionally, involving students, parents, and community members in discussions about school safety can help create a sense of ownership and collective responsibility for creating a safe and supportive learning environment.

" Choosing a new outfit can be a fun and exciting process. Here are some steps to consider when selecting a new outfit:  Determine the Occasion: The first step in choosing a new outfit is to consider the occasion for which it will be worn. Is it a casual outing with friends or a formal event like a wedding? This will help you determine the appropriate level of formality and style for the outfit.  Consider Personal Style: It's important to choose an outfit that reflects your personal style and makes you feel confident and comfortable. Consider the colors, patterns, and silhouettes that you typically gravitate towards and try to incorporate them into your new outfit.  Choose a Focal Point: Every outfit should have a focal point, such as a statement piece of jewelry or a bold patterned blouse. This will add interest and dimension to your outfit and make it stand out.  Consider Fit: A well-fitted outfit can make all the difference in how you feel and look. Make sure to try on different sizes and styles to find the best fit for your body type.  Accessorize: Accessories can add the finishing touches to any outfit. Consider adding a belt, scarf, or statement earrings to complete your look.  Comfort is Key: Lastly, make sure to choose an outfit that is comfortable and easy to move in. You don't want to be fidgeting with your clothing or feeling uncomfortable throughout the day or evening.  By following these steps, you can choose a new outfit that fits your personal style and makes you feel confident and comfortable.        ",1
"I got home from Burnet today from hunting and it wasn't that great. The dove weren't flying when I was there maybe its because I'm bad luck. Sometimes I think stupid things like that, like maybe for instance people were catching fish before I got there then when I got there I didn't catch anything and neither did anybody else. Super smells really good right now I think mom is cooking mashed potatoes and ribs. Sounds really good because I'm so hungry I haven't eaten all day. Speaking of not eating all day I just realized how fun my weekend was. That's why I haven't really eaten that much. Food sounds so good. Friday night I went out to a few parties and tried to get into frat parties but they're all gay and wont let any dudes in. Even though it was me with a bunch of girls they still wouldn't let me in. I'm pissed. From now on when I have a party I'm not letting any frat people in just hot sorority girls. Some of my friends are in sororities they seem cool. Anyway, then I went to the UT game on Saturday and we stomped all over North Texas. I kind of felt bad but not really. Its weird to be at a UT game and say ""this is my school. ""  I'm so used to being in high school and going to high school games I'm not used to seeing 80000 people at a game for my school. I wish school didn't involve class. I love the college atmosphere but not the class part. Maybe my psychology professor will give me an A. That would be great of him. He's a cool guy though I like his class. All my other professors are boring but he knows how to have fun while he lectures. I'm glad I got out of my calculus class and in a different one because professor radin is not cool at all. he needs to learn how to be not so uptight. My new calculus professor is cool though he's more laid back and knows how to teach things and give examples. Gosh I'm hungry I wish dinner were ready already. Taco Cabana is really good late at night I just realized that. I'm glad it's open 24 hrs because where would I go eat at 3 a. M?  Speaking of Taco Cabana San Antonio was fun I just wish we went to Cowboys and danced a little. San Antonio was cool but not as cool as burnet I want to hurry up and go hunting again. maybe this weekend I'll go back and shoot some more birds. Girls make me so mad. Why does a certain somebody have to be stupid all the time?  She bitches too much at me for little things. I should just not talk to her anymore. I don't know why I can't just not talk to her. All girls are the same to me, they all bitch about stupid things and get mad at you for saying hi to other girls that are your friends but they go off and say hi to their guy friends and expect us not to get mad at them. It's dumb. Jenna is dumb too. She should have ditched her boyfriend to hang out with her quote best friend Kelly on her birthday. She is stupid for choosing someone she just barely met over her best friend. Kelly doesn't deserve to cry I should yell at Jenna for that. Jessica is a cool girl she cares about me and doesn't want anything to happen to me I should hang out with her more. Stony Point football will always suck. They lose too much. New coaches are cool though I wish he was there when I was there. I need to do chemistry homework. He needs to stop mumbling and getting off topic to. My TA pisses me off so much I think I'm smarter than her. All the answers I had were right and the ones she gave me were wrong I can't believe that. 66 on the first hw is crap. there goes my confidence. She's a good looking girl though I'll give her that much but she can't help for crap. hopefully by this weekend I'll have my work done so I can hunt. I really can't stop thinking about hunting. I want to shoot me a deer I've never shot one before. Season opens soon I think so dove will have to do for now.",0
"Roommates are playing music very loudly. Although, this music is good blues unlike the top 40 crap that normally comes blaring out of their speakers. My roommate is on the phone with a friend complaining about his classes, assignments, his teachers, and the other usual complaint. In the back of my mind I am a bit nervous about the paper I have to write for my Rhetoric 306 class. procrastination was a big problem of mine throughout high school. For a change, I wrote a page of the paper last night. However, I am not sure of the quality but nevertheless it is only a first draft and I just need to turn it in on time. Bing! Bang BooM! I hope I see this girl named Melissa at the Delta Gamma mixer tonight. I can't believe she lived in my hometown of Kansas City for two years. It's A small world after all. It's a small, small world.

I wonder why my brother Brent has not emailed me back. I wonder where he is? Did he leave Seattle? Who Knows? blankness washing over me. Who, who, who let, who let who who who let them dawgs out? Whistling in the hall. Shut Up! You are annoying me and taking over my stream of consciousness, but I guess it doesn't really matter what goes through the stream because the whole idea is just to type what is going through the mind. What is going through the mind? Tired? No, not particularly. Back is getting a little stiff though. Count backwards from 150 by seven and see if stress level goes up. Sickness. I was sick last week. coughing coughing coughing. runny nose, headache, ears hurt, throat hurt. Aaaagghh! Maggie. I miss my baby girl. She is a one year old poodle who I spent my entire summer with because of my broken leg. I miss her. I think she misses me. I hope she misses me. She has been sleeping on my bed. I hope she doesn't think I have abandoned her. Whistling. Boy, these guys are loud. Two days after a workout is when you are at your peak soreness. Full hour late for class.

"Just like everyone else's writings, I'm sure starting off with I don't know what to write is commonplace. we used to have to write like this in english last year but Mrs. williams would give us a specific topic- like ""king kong"" or ""umbrellas"". she was the coolest teacher, she really had a good time teaching our class and made sure we had a good time too. a lot of the guys took advantage of her good nature though, especially when we had to do the ""hobbitt"" project and austin named one of the characters ""dildo daggins"". that was interesting because Mrs. williams couldn't really hear them say ""dildo"" and wondered why the class was laughing so hard. I wasn't in that class but I got to hear all about it. I really miss all those guys, we had a pretty close group of friends because we all grew up together and went to pretty much all the same schools together. by graduation there were about 7 of us that had gone through school together since pre-k. I think that says a lot about us. there are others that I've gone to school with since elementary school too since we were all in the same advanced classes. this annoying ""firewall alert"" keeps popping up on my screen and it's bugging the fire out of me cause I don't like computers to begin with and I can't get it to stop. kinda like our smoke detector. it beeped for 4 days before someone would come to change it. my roommate went out of town this weekend and when she got back and came in the room she said ""is that thing STILL beeping?"" and she told me it had been beeping for 2 days and she kept forgetting to report it. so I went downstairs to report it and they told me no one would come until at least Monday because the maintenance crew doesn't work on the weekends. it really sucks cause I couldn't study or sleep in here because the thing beeped every 45 seconds. I ended up staying at towers with my guy friends from high school and we had a really good time- so I guess it worked out. I think I'm going to start dating their third roommate- he is from san antonio and I've really gotten to know him the past couple of weeks cause I'm always at my guy friends' place. oh yah- and the maintenance guy finally came today and fixed the smoke detector. I don't know where my roommate is, she left at 5:30 for her sorority meeting and I left for mine at 6 but she is still not back and it's almost 9. my dad called today and wants me to go to my grandparents sometime soon and shut off the hot water heater. my grandparents have been traveling in colorado since the beginning of july and when my parents came to move me in they stayed out at my grandparents (in south austin) and forgot to turn off the hot water heater. I don't understand why he wants me to do it- he could call their neighbors, which would be a lot more convenient (sp?) for me since I don't have a car. I called two of my friends to see if I could borrow their car but neither one of them picked up the phone, so maybe my roommate will take me out there later. I wish I could drive her car but it's a standard and I'm not very good at them. I got my nose re-pierced last night, chasity (my roommate) went with me. I got it done when I was in Ecuador this summer for a dollar and here they wanted $30! I wanted to scream. but oh well- it'll be there for a while. I took it out when I got home from ecuador because I didn't know how my parents would feel about it, and I know my dad's parents would shit bricks if they saw it, so I decided to play it cool and take it out when I was around my parents or grandparents, but it became too much of a hassle and I left it out too long. I really like it though- the stud it a tiny light blue rhinestone. I have a white one I got while I was in ecuador that I'm going to change out pretty soon. my roommate has her nose pierced too. I can't wait to show my brother. I called him last night to tell him and he was kinda mad that I did it without him because I had told him that I'd get it done before I left for college and that he could go with me but it just never happened. it's a big thing in Chile from girls to have their nose pierced and while we were in Ecuador a youth group of about 20 came up from Chile. I really miss Ecuador- I can't wait to go back, even though I don't speak the language very well I made a lot of great relationships. this one guy, dandle, from Chile, really had an impact on me. we still talk through e-mail daily and it's awesome to see things from his perspective. he is the person I'd most like to see again. he taught himself to speak English- he is never had a formal English lesson, and he wants to be a youth minister or music minister. I'm so impressed by his faith and his determination to educate himself. I really wish I had that mindset and determination to better myself without the help of teachers and tutors and school- but there are so many opportunities here that make it easier to get help I suppose. the time's almost up- I really didn't think I'd be able to type and think for 20 minutes but it's kinda flown by in a hurry- bye!",0
"  On one hand, smaller families can provide more resources, attention, and opportunities to their children. With fewer children, parents can allocate more time, energy, and financial resources towards each child's development and education. This can result in better academic and social outcomes for the children. Smaller families can also reduce the strain on the environment, as fewer people consume fewer resources.  On the other hand, larger families can provide built-in social support networks, as siblings can provide emotional and practical support throughout their lives. In addition, larger families can expose children to a greater diversity of perspectives and experiences. Children in larger families can learn important social skills, such as conflict resolution and teamwork, through their interactions with their siblings.  Ultimately, the decision to have a smaller or larger family depends on individual circumstances and values. While some families may choose to have smaller families to provide better opportunities for their children, others may prioritize the social and emotional benefits of a larger family. It is important to consider the unique needs and goals of each family before making a decision.            ",1
"I guess I have no started my 20 minutes of writing for the psychology class. As I'm writing I keep on looking at the clock to see what time it is to see when I'm supposed to finish typing. I think about what I was thinking in class when you talked to us about this HW and how I wanted to talk about certain things while I was doing. But actually I start thinking about what happened tonight. We all hung out with the fraternity and just bonded by going to dinner and then going to just talk and catch up on everything we did over the summer and afterwards we played capture the flag. I wish my roommate would listen to better music. After capture the flag we all decided to go swimming instead of capture the flag because we had all gotten tired. We put it to the vote and that's what we ended up doing. Afterwards our President asked us to make this a dry event. I support him 100% because one I don't drink, two I don't think that it is necessary to drink to have a good time, and three I think that all the points that he made were very strong. My roommates had a problem with it because we are all part of the executive board and we thought that before saying that he should have asked us all instead of doing it by himself. I think that they are wrong anyhow because as President I think that Ted did the right thing in telling us not to drink and I don't think that there was a need for him to consult us. It was an executive decision. I'm debating whether I should go outside to the pool with everyone else when I'm done with that. I was supposed to get together with a friend of mine tonight but we have been playing phone tag so it's not going to happen but I will see her on Monday so I'm still happy. This weekend I have lots of things to do. I'm running through my schedule for the weekend. Tomorrow I have to meet for lunch with a friend and afterwards we are going to the lake to just hang out. I keep on thinking about what else I'm going to write and how interesting this paper really is. I have never really sat down and typed everything I'm thinking but at the same time many of my teachers have always told me that I type just like I think; this causes my grades in grammar to be much lower. My leg really hurt because me and one of my roommates were messing around and we both deadlegged each other. But after the pain that we have both caused we have promised each other that we will never do that again. We'll see if we actually will keep it but I think we will. I'm the only one in the apartment right now cause everyone else is outside. I think about everything else I could have done tonight but in all honesty the last thing I really wanted to do was to go out and actually do something. I am very happy with the way that the evening turned out even though I would still have liked to see my friend tonight. I kind of like this girl but I'm not sure. She's cute and everything but we haven't really gotten to know each other well enough to where I can say that I like her but I do think that she's kind of interested. I also think about my friend who is coming up from Southwest next week to come see and how she's going to spend the night. We have been friends for a long time and we get along great. But the thing is that we both have really flirty personalities so I'm kind of wondering if anything is going to happen. I know that it can't be too much because I have a lot of selfcontrol but at the same time I don't want thing to get weird or to have a girlfriend right now. If anything happens it will just be maybe a little cuddling here and there or maybe a kiss. We will most likely end up sleeping in the same bed but we'll see. I have the full intention of not having sex. I never have and never will until the day I get married. I have thought about being a priest for a long time so I'm just waiting for God to give me my call and I will follow His will. I really hope that he hurries up though cause I don't have a lot of patience. I think that I have a lot of qualities but patience is not one of them. I can be patient for certain things but I just hate waiting for people to give me an answer. I know that God doesn't count in that but I try to hurry Him up. One of my friends told me this summer that if you ever wanted to make God laugh all you had to do was to tell Him your plans. I'm wondering whether this will mean anything to you guys. I guess that it all depends on whether you are Christian or Catholic or simply don't believe in God or have another religion. I realize that there are a lot of people here at UT that simply doesn't believe in God and I think that that is really sad because they are missing out on a great part of life. I keep on looking at the clock and seeing how much time is left. I wish that everyone would be able to believe in God and receive the Eucharist everyday. It is the most amazing gift that God gave us. It's sad how some people just ignore God or sometimeseven laugh in His face. This was what I originally wanted to talk about when I was thinking about what I was going to write in this paper. I thought that it would be great thing to think about because there is so much that I can write on but then I realized that I couldn't do that because it would have been planned. So I decided to kind of clear my mind and just speak my mind. For the most part I think that it worked because as I think back of all the things that I have written for the past 20 minutes I have gone through various different topics. Ranging from drinking, to girls, to God. I think this was a really cool experiment and that other people should do it because it is a great way to realize what is going on in your head but also to help you put what goes through your mind in words. I realize that the time is up and that I no longer need to be writing but I'm also going to stop because my hands are really hurting. I notice that I almost finished a complete page of writing.",0
"I don't know if I should go home or not this weekend. I want to stay, but. I hope my computer doesn't freeze while I'm writing this, that would totally suck  I'm glad I'm getting this out of the way, normally I would wait till the last possible second, but I don't trust computers since I've been here. I really want to like it here but I just don't. All my friends that went to oter schools are having a great time, they're meeting new people doing new things, but evryone I meet bores me, it seems as though everyone is the same. I don't even feel like going out and having fun. The only reason I want to is so mabe I'd come to like UT better. I see so many people I know, its kinda weird, when theres about fifty thousand people here. I'm a business major but the only class that is relavant to busins is my freshman BA class which meets only once a week. I'm afraid I'm not goingto find the parties here that much fun. From what I've heard its just people getting drunk and thats not that much fun. I worry that all the expectations I've had about college are misconceptions. I love this keyboard. I like typing, but I can't use regular desktops, because I can't sit still. I sund like a dumbass when I repeat myself. Alex told me the funniest joke but I can't remember it although when he told me I tried to memorize it. I hate it here when I think about hte people at home. I have no one here. I'm so bored. My classes are boring for the mostpart, and I'm finally getting the hang of schedules and shit. I want to call my cousin, who is my role model and ask if she liked her first month in colllege. She always putwss me in a good mood. Justin says there ids nothing wrong with my comp but why the hell does it keep freezing?  I think twenty minutes are almost up nope I still have bout ten to go. My tth classes are so long. I start gettig restless- that music next door is so loud and I am so tired I want to take a nap. I had to wake upa a t",0
"Hmmm. lets see well nothing is really going on. I have to go to the doctor tomorrow at 10:15 because I have a sinus infection. a few things about it though are kind of fishy. I have to see a sports medicine doctor, not a real doctor. Also, the guy on the phone was a little weird. I am also scared that  by tomorrow I will be well again and won't need to go to the doctor. I have been sick for three weeks and am tired of being sick so I guess I should go. I kind of miss my room at home. It is hard to have to share a room with someone. This is the first time I have never had a room all to myself. Sometimes I wish the room was just mine but I am ok with it because I know it is good to have a room mate. Christine is nice, she is just a little whiney sometimes and always breaks things. I really need to work out but I cannot because of this sinus infection that I have. When I run, or even walk, my face hurts a lot from the sinus fluids in it. How that works, I don't know. I was thinking about it. How can sinus fluid hurt your face. I could ask the doctor, but I am too lazy to listen to the answer so I won't. Hmmm. whatever is on my mind. I really have a lot of studying to do. It is 10:00 in the morning and I woke up just to study. Getting this done though makes me feel as if I have gotten something accomplished. I like that feeling of accomplishment. Everytime you do something you get a check. Chapter 1: Check, Chapter 2: Check. The check feels really good. I don't know why it feels so good but it does. I am kind of concerned right now about the time. This clock on the computer is really off but I am using it anyway. I just have to time 20 minutes right? I have ten minutes left. I have rally never known how to spell the word minute. I don't even know if that is right. For all I know that could be the for minute(as in small) I even spelled it one time minuet, but latter found to my embarrassment, that unless I was talking about music, it wasn't. So for now I just always right minutes. as the abbreviation, in order to spare myself the pain and embarrassment of spelling it wrong, even though I just spelled embarrassment wrong and still don't know which spelling I typed it wrong. I am actually a good speller, I promise. I just get confused sometimes. This it boring for me so it must be boring for whoever is reading it. I guess I will type about something interesting. Hmmmm lets see. I really want Matheus(sp) to do that recording test on me. The one where is records every five minutes. (See there that word is ageing) I really would like to know what is going on in my life. So far this is what I think is going on but I am not really sure. I am sick and am going to the doctor tomorrow. I need to get a bike because my classes are too far away. I am mad a some of my friends for getting football tickets without me: I stood in line for an hour last week by myself to get them for them. I don't have a football ticket. I think I might go to Fort Worth instead for the weekend because my grandpa is sick. He is not really sick, just a little depressed because he is getting old. I thought I might cheer him up. It makes my grandma up set so I though she could use some cheering up too. And this is why I need to take the Recording test. Because I hope, if not already think there is something more going on in my life that I do not realize. It has been 20 minutes- good bye.",0
"  Today's talk shows are designed to generate high ratings and attract viewers, and often do so by featuring provocative and controversial topics. This can result in heated debates between guests and audience members, which can sometimes turn physical and lead to injury.  While some may argue that this is a sign of talk shows going too far, it is important to remember that individuals have the freedom to choose whether or not they want to participate in such shows. In addition, talk show producers have a responsibility to ensure the safety and well-being of their guests and audience members.  That being said, it is important for talk show producers to balance the desire for high ratings with a commitment to safety and responsible journalism. They should take steps to ensure that guests and audience members feel comfortable and respected, and that debates do not become too heated or violent. Ultimately, it is up to the individual viewer to decide whether they find the content of these shows appropriate or not.  ",1
" The Greek proverb ""All things good to know are difficult to learn"" suggests that acquiring knowledge requires effort and challenges. While it is true that some subjects or skills may require more effort to learn, it is not always the case that the most valuable or important things are the most challenging.  For instance, learning a new language or mastering a musical instrument can be challenging and time-consuming, but they may not be the most crucial things to know in life. On the other hand, some critical life skills such as communication, empathy, and decision-making may not be difficult to learn, but they are incredibly valuable to know.  Moreover, the proverb implies that the difficulty of learning something makes it more valuable. However, the value of knowledge is subjective and varies depending on the person's interests, needs, and goals. For example, learning computer programming may be challenging for some people, but if it does not align with their interests or career aspirations, it may not be as valuable to them as it is to others.  In conclusion, while some things may be difficult to learn, it is not always the case that the most important or valuable things are the most challenging. The value of knowledge is subjective and depends on individual interests, needs, and goals.             ",1
" I can help you with generating an essay on a public health concern. Here is a possible introduction:  Public health is the science and practice of protecting and improving the health of populations through prevention, promotion, and policy. Public health aims to address the social, environmental, and economic determinants of health that affect individuals and communities. Public health also responds to emerging and re-emerging health threats, such as infectious diseases, natural disasters, and bioterrorism. However, public health faces many challenges and opportunities in the 21st century, as the world becomes more interconnected, diverse, and complex. In this essay, I will discuss one of the public health concerns that I believe is serious enough to warrant immediate attention: food insecurity1.  Food insecurity is defined as the lack of consistent access to enough food for an active, healthy life. According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), more than 800 million people in the world suffer from chronic hunger, and more than 2 billion people experience moderate or severe food insecurity. Food insecurity can have negative impacts on physical and mental health, such as malnutrition, stunting, obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, depression, and anxiety. Food insecurity can also contribute to social and political instability, violence, and conflict. Food insecurity is influenced by multiple factors, such as poverty, inequality, climate change, population growth, urbanization, migration, trade policies, food waste, and food systems. Therefore, addressing food insecurity requires a comprehensive and multisectoral approach that involves collaboration among governments, civil society, private sector, academia, and international organizations.

"At the moment, I am tired. I just woke up a little while ago, and I'm writing. I can't stand writing. I don't mind the work. It's just that writing doesn't come naturally to me. I was wondering the other day, If college was reall going to change me into the genius I expect to be. I mean, when I get out into the career world, will I know ""everything"" I need to know about my job? Will I have to know everything? Will there be room for training and learning? Confusion! I guess its not a bad thing, but to be confused is embarrasing. I guess what I'm really getting at is without confusion life would be absolutely tedious. As I sit here in my apartment, closed off from society, I can't help but realize how much I miss my family back home. Although college is my main priority and the fact that I don't care what anyone thinks about me, I can't help but wonder if my family thinks I can make it or not, if I have what it takes. That is always in my mind somewhere. I, myself, know I can make it. I know I have what it takes to succeed. However, when I do graduate and get a career job, is that it? Is that going to be my life until I retire. I am very spontaneous and I won't be able to stand getting into a daily routine. I stopped writing for a second to gather my thoughts and I read the assignment again. I have no earthly idea how my mind works or why it works like it does. I'm not a scientist and I don't care to be. I just want to be happy.",0
"My name is Kate Mayer. Right now i am feeling extremely uneasy. Lately I have been stressing out about everything, from school work to social matters. For instance, this week i have some type of homework due everday this week starting Wednesday. Last night I worked for five hours straight on homework. I had to make myself take a break and go to Kin's Corner and eat because I hadn't eaten lunch or dinner, there simply just wasnt enough time. Anyway on Wednesday I have this huge english rough draft due and the final paper is due on Friday. I have a Geology test at 8 in the morning on Thursday, and I do not work well in the mornings, especially when I am stressed. I try to run in the Kinsolving gym to take some of the pressure off me and it helps a little. I just get on the treadmill and go. thinking and making plans for the week and how I can manage my time wisely. I keep thinking that once the weekend comes, I will be okay. I'm going home to visit my family and friends and all my worries will be left here in Austin. That scares me a little because I'm afraid I will be dreading coming back here because Austin is my home now. That's another thing that gives me a little anxiety. Right now I don't really feel that i have a home per say. I know that I am always welcome in Victoria (my hometown) but I have a hard time considering it my actual home. Kinsolving is my new residence but i feel uncomfortable calling it my actual home. I guess I just have to get used to it. Even though i feel anxiety about this small issue, I do not feel much   homesickness   that freshman are supposed to feel for their parents and friends. I do miss them a lot but I have not been upset by the fact that they are not going to be around me for support or whatever I might need from them. I guess in a way I am really enjoying my independence. I was scared before I came here and i realize now that I am okay alone. There are a lot of times that I need to be with people and socialize but leaving my comfort zone is the best thing that I could have ever done. I have discovered so many things about myself that I didnt know I even had in me, such as my need for independence. Right now my roommate just walked in. Most people I have talked to tell me that they have spent about two hours with their roommate. I do almost everything withe mine. She is my best friend here. We think alot alike. Our room is just the way we wanted it, if not better. There are 11 posters of famous celebrities like Marilyn Monroe and Bob Dylan. Our room smells of perfume cause we both spray it non stop, not because it smells bad but because. well I'm not exactly sure why. My mind is going blank. thinking. okay there is no air condition in our room or if there is, it is extremely hot in here and we have a fan blowing ALL the time. I live in supplemental housing so this isn't an actual dorm room-I think it is some kind of storage room-but in any case, I like it here. It feels cozy besides the temperature. Im thinking that if I still live here in the winter, I will be okay because it's always hot in here. who knows?!  Anyway I am extremely tired, it is so hard making myself get up in the morning and go to class. The only reason I get up every morning is because I'm so afraid that I am going to fall behind. Actually, I feel that I am always behind. I do not procrastinate, or at least I try not to, but there's just something inside me that makes me feel that there is always something that needs to be done and I cannot slip up and get caught behind. I always leave extra early for things just so I will not be late. I have a math class right after my rhetoric and composition class, which is all the way across campus. I am always late for my math class and it bothers me so much. It scares me to miss the first few minutes of that class because I might have missed some important information like homework or some change in the schedule. I guess you could call it paranoia, I don't know. Well, I think that since I've always been this way, I work well under pressure. I don't really like it but, but I'm so used to it. Maybe that's a good thing coming to a big university. Time's up!!",0

" Some people argue that it is not appropriate to deceive children by pretending that Santa Claus is real. They believe that children may feel betrayed when they eventually learn the truth and may lose trust in their parents and other adults.  On the other hand, supporters of the Santa Claus tradition argue that it is a harmless and fun way to celebrate the holiday season. They believe that the story of Santa Claus adds to the magic and excitement of Christmas, and helps to create happy memories for children.  In the end, whether or not children should be led to believe in Santa Claus is a personal decision that each family must make. Some families choose to embrace the tradition while others do not. Regardless of one's personal beliefs, it is important to always prioritize the well-being and happiness of children.               ",1
well. how do I start? I suppose I'll just start by saying that I am very tired of school I don't even know why so soon I mean my classes aren't all that bad yet but I'm tired of waking up so early to catch the crowded bus and always having to walk everywhere in the heat one thing I am excited about is my boyfriend coming down in less than 9 days to visit me. he's from texas tech and I miss him so much the only bad thing is that I think that I'm hiding myself from the world because I feel safe enough with him that I block out the rest of the world and therefore I am not quite as social as I should be. but I'm really worried that I'm going to lose him and then where will I be? who will I have? oh well can't think of that right now. I'll enjoy my life with him for now long distance relationships are very hard. I don't quite know what will happen but I do know that he is very special to me and every guy I go out with in the future will be compared to him enough about the mushy stuff I'm living with my sister up here its really convenient she takes care of me and we don't really fight a lot she's sick right now I don't know what to do except for buy her medicine I'm a bad nurse oh wells I can't believe we have been in school for bout 2 weeks now. it feels like 2 months everything is moving by so slow I miss Dallas I can't wait to go back and visit my family and friends ill be going back in bout 2 weeks or so I hate it that I'm easily distracted when I start on my homework the tv usually gets to me because we have cable and so some really good movie will be on and ill sit there and watch it instead of working on my homework. that's really starting to become a habit and the thing is when the show is finally over and I start on my homework its already 12 and I'm pooped I need better study habits I'm currently a biology major. I don't even think that's what I'm going to follow through here I don't go out partying like most college students I think I should take advantage of my college years here but I really don't like the whole clubbing experience I'm full and I feel like vomiting. I think I ate too many chicken wings. oh wells I hate the computer I'm on the internet connection is really slow and I hate tying on a laptop computer. I'm use to the normal ones I still have a lot of reading to do I have to finish reading in this class and in biology. I hope I don't bomb any of my classes my parents expect me not to since my sister is here and will show me the ropes. do you know how much pressure that is? I feel as if I never seem to make my parents proud enough it comes with the territory. being the middle child is really hard anyways. I miss chili our chinchilla ill get to keep him for about 3 weeks so I'm really excited our apartment is so messy we live like boys I'm getting really tired already. I think ill be up late yet again tonight ill shower tomorrow morning I've dyed my hair 5 times and yet it wont give me the color I want I'm so frustrated I'm frustrated with life with school with love everything when I took the pretesting thing I felt so depressed. everything I was answering about myself was so negative. in some way and so I felt really bad once I was done. that reminds me I have to go check out that bulletin board to check out some experiments I could to do obtain my 5 hours actually now 3 1/2 which is great. I hope they don't make me do anything really weird I'm kind of hesitant to do that stuff oh wells I haven't been out a lot since I've been here in Austin I'm kind of homesick.

I need some sleep. I'm going to sleep goodbye.,0
" The use of cell phones while driving can distract drivers and increase the risk of accidents. Studies have shown that talking on a hand-held phone while driving can be just as dangerous as driving while under the influence of alcohol. Therefore, the implementation of laws prohibiting the use of hand-held cell phones while driving can potentially reduce the number of accidents and fatalities caused by distracted driving.  In addition, the use of hands-free devices, such as Bluetooth or speakerphone, can provide a safer alternative for drivers who need to make or receive phone calls while driving. In fact, some states have implemented laws that allow for the use of hands-free devices while driving, but still prohibit the use of hand-held devices.  However, some individuals may argue that these laws may infringe on their personal freedom and that the enforcement of such laws may be difficult. Additionally, some may argue that the use of cell phones while driving is not the only source of distraction and that other forms of distraction, such as eating or adjusting the radio, should also be addressed.  Ultimately, the decision to pass laws prohibiting the use of hand-held cell phones while driving is up to each individual state, and it should take into consideration the potential benefits and drawbacks of such laws.

"I just started college last week. It's hard to believe I am finally here. I have been coming to Austin for football games as long as I can remember, but I always go home when they are over. This time I am staying and my family is going home. It's so hard for me to think I will be spending the next four years here. It's so big and full of so many people. The first day of class I didn't know what to think. I was so overwhelmed by it all. I decided to go through rush here at UT, and that was an experience all on it's own. It was a week full of stress, and aching feet. You are surrounded by a bunch of girls that are trying to out do the next and you can't really tell if people are being fake or themselves. I just hoped for the best and tried to have fun. Now that it is all over and I made my bid. I was relieved a little, but not enough. The day after rush ended classes begin. I had no time to relax or get things together. I was stressing out more than I had ever before. I didn't know where my classes were, I missed my friends and family, my roommate and I have been a little off, it seemed like nothing was going right. I really wanted to cry. It's so hard for me to think that I am not happy here because I can vividly recall not too long ago saying that I couldn't wait to get out of high school and get to college. I was so excited about moving to Austin. I didn't think I would miss my family too much because they would be coming down for all the home football games. Boy, was I wrong. I told everyone that I wouldn't think of going home my first weekend of college, but as I sat in my dorm room last Friday thinking about all my friends going home for the holiday I don't think I could have packed up my stuff any quicker. I was so excited about going home. I couldn't wait to get there. Even though I did homework and laid around most of the weekend it was very nice to just relax and not have to worry about anything. There are so many things to do in Austin and even when you say your not going out, someone is always trying to talk you into going somewhere. My past week of college has been fun, but scary. I am not use to being so unorganized. I need a schedule and a daily routine, so I won't feel so strung out and frazzled. So many things have been going through my head, about college and how I feel about it and I can't exactly put it all into words. When people ask me about school I don't know what to tell them. I wish I could say I love it and I am having a blast, but I would be lying. I have had fun, but I am kind of scared and homesick and I feel like I am in a maze and I can't find my way out. I don't think I am making any sense. My feelings are just all jumbled up and I can't seem to sort through them. I need direction. I am hoping every week will get better and I will gradually find my way and start to feel at home here.",0
" However, I can provide some objective information and arguments that may help you form your own opinion.  Proponents of extending the school year argue that it would provide several benefits. Firstly, it would prevent the ""summer slide,"" where students can lose some of the knowledge and skills they learned during the school year due to the long break. Secondly, it would provide more time for teachers to cover material and for students to absorb it, leading to better academic outcomes. Thirdly, it would make it easier for families to plan vacations and childcare arrangements, as there would be more breaks throughout the year instead of one long vacation.  On the other hand, opponents of extending the school year argue that summer break provides important opportunities for students to engage in non-academic activities, such as sports, arts, and travel, that can be difficult to pursue during the school year. They also argue that summer break provides a necessary respite for students and teachers alike, and that extending the school year could lead to burnout and decreased motivation. Additionally, extending the school year would require significant changes to school schedules, which could be difficult to implement and costly for school districts.  In conclusion, the decision to extend the school year or not is a complex one that involves balancing academic needs, family needs, and the well-being of students and teachers. Ultimately, the best approach may vary depending on the specific needs and circumstances of each community.  ",1
"Right now I am thinking about the convocation I have in about 45 minutes. But I'll definitely need to leave in around thirty. that boy Michael was really cute. really cute. he is the first nice looking Mexican that I have seen yet. Ok maybe there were a few others but he lives on my floor and he introduced himself. that's one of the things I don't like about this school. no one introduces themselves to each other. it's like everyone only cares about their own lives and won't be bothered by anyone else's. but you know what. I think everyone else wants to meet people too, at least the majority but they just don't know how to go about doing it so they act like they don't care and disinterested or they act like they are much too busy and much too good for anyone else. it's very sad I think. at the beginning everyone is all excited, expecting other people to be really nice and friendly and then they meet the first bitchy person. Now they realize how things work around here and in an effort not to get thwarted and rejected by another person, they too take on the same attitude and on goes the downward spiral. just because we all fear a little bit of rejection. Sad really. that was my friend matt from economics class. He's not really my friend but I sit next to him in class. he seems nice enough and he is going to let me borrow his econ book since mine has not come in the mail yet. I'm going to be so behind in economics. I tell you. I really like that class though. so anyways. I know how this goes because I thought everyone would be nice and friendly but I was met with blank stares when I smiled at anyone anywhere on campus with the exception of a few. A very few. whatever. I am still going to smile and I am still going to introduce myself and be nice because otherwise I will be miserable and unapproachable like those people. ugh. I just put ""so anyways"" instead of ""so anyway"" I think that sounds as dumb as ""laters"" when one really means ""later"". that is really very jr. high. I miss those days. I wonder how Cindy is doing. ugh. I really don't want to go to the convocation because everyone is just going to be with their own little group and I will be an outcast once again. I'm pretty and nice and outgoing and popular and smart. Damn that sounds really conceited. Maybe I'm a little of that too. I considered erasing a couple of those adjectives but I think that's pretty dumb considering I really do think those things about myself. it's not socially acceptable to think good things about yourself. It's much more appealing to not know any of the good things about oneself. I confess that I too am attracted to ignorance of ones own worth and humility and modesty. But if you know it about yourself I think it is worse to act like you are modest and humble than to just admit it. Within reason that is. so anyway. I am these things but I feel like people don't want to reach out and meet new people and therefore I get shafted. I know they will like me if they get to know me but it's that introducing part that is really limiting. kind of stops the whole getting to know you thing prematurely. I am so proud of myself lately. I am being such a good girl. Although my habit of exercising everyday at 5 has been rudely interrupted with today's events of the five o'clock dinner at Trudy's which was pointless to attempt because I missed it anyway. I should have just gone to work out anyway and not let meetings and such get in the way of my schedule esp. when they are unimportant. I'm really irritated by that. but back to the story. I have been developing such good habits. I make my bed everyday, I wash my face twice a day, I get all my assignments down early or at least I begin them really early. O shit. I just got a little flash of procrastination. That sneaky devil. NO GO AWAY!!!. I'm not going to be a procrastinator this year. I just don't have the time for that. I run every day . Mon-thurs. 2 miles a day. plus I see a few cute boys in the gym that's always nice. kind of a motivating factor. when I get back from the convocation I'm going to go run otherwise my whole system will be screwed up. Damn that dinner. UGH. What else do I do. O yea. I didn't even go out last weekend and I had no desire too. I haven't been drinking. I haven't been too flakey. With the exception of ross but that's quite not my fault most of the time. Anyway we are good terms at the present. I'm being a pretty good daughter. I finished my scholarship applications stuff. what to write about now. I want to write about something cool. No luck. I really want to join the p2 chamber music group but I hope that they allow flutes. Bad flutes in lol. I'm probably really bad by now. I wonder if there is practice rooms around. I need to find one anyway to practice the piano anyway. I thought it would be a lot easier to get guys here. I thought they'd be all confident and just come up to you. And then I would act all shy and innocent. It's just how I act. Natural reflex to wanted attention. Sometimes I think I'm so stupid. And then they would flatter me and ask me out. And I would act like I wasn't really sure. I little bit suspicious of their motives. (and rightly so I imagine) and then I would say ok and give them my number and things would be lovely. well I have to go to the convocation that will steal hours of my life away. see yaw. This has been a pleasant venting experience I tell you.",0

" When setting a table for a company, there are a few general guidelines that you can follow to ensure that the table is properly set and appropriate for the occasion. Here are some steps you can follow:  Determine the type of event: Different events will require different table settings. For example, a formal dinner may require more elaborate table settings than a casual lunch.  Choose the tablecloth and napkins: Select a tablecloth that fits the occasion and the size of the table. Make sure the napkins are clean, ironed, and placed on the left-hand side of the plate.  Arrange the plates: Place the dinner plate in the center of the place setting, with the salad plate on top of it if it's a multi-course meal.  Set the silverware: Arrange the silverware in the order that they will be used, with the utensils needed for the first course on the outside and the utensils for the final course on the inside. Forks are placed on the left, and knives and spoons are placed on the right.  Place the glasses: Glasses are placed above the knife on the right-hand side of the plate, with the water glass closest to the plate and the wine glasses arranged in order of use from left to right.  Add decorative touches: Add a centerpiece, such as flowers or candles, to the table if appropriate. You can also add place cards or menus if the event requires it.  Check everything before the event: Double-check the table setting to make sure everything is in place and clean before the guests arrive.  Remember, the key to setting a table for a company is to make it appropriate for the occasion and to pay attention to the details.     ",1
"Hello looks like a journal entry. Frustrating blank page as usual, not nearly as much  pressure as a true journal might be. No, true journals (at least the ones I know) come complete  with the most irrational, egotistical, subjective criticisms at all. Here, I might simply start to list  adjectives. Think I will. Chair, run, cake, spoon, sparrow, harly, make, spy, insult, laughter,  organization, economy, ----- complete crap!!! Ha! Adjectives are fun. What to make of this  phenomenal opportunity?  Don't be shy, be compliant. Or just spew forth venom, anecdotes,  general life lessons. Inclination says talk about ""me"". Here's what that is. Or so we'll try. Music, menus, frustration. Solitary, isolated, friendship social butterfly. Making waves the size  of anthills, feeling pretty depressed about it. The color of the water is green. Count the levels  of meaning there. Anaphor. Hyperbole. Homonyms. Czech Republic. Czeska Republica. The  United States of my Ass. Could I say here that I want to ______ the president?  Protect Identity. The blank might have been filled with ""make love"" or ""marry"" or ""help through important  issues"". Certainly not ""castrate. ""  What else?  Looking forward to making A's lots of A's, because  after all purpose belongs to those classes in which one might be rewarded for hard work and  ass kissing. Discombobulated this page may be, but organization's overrated. I know a quote:  one advantage of being disorganized is that one is constantly making new discoveries. ""  That  one's right above Dad's desk at the office. Why do I experience comfort in an environment less  than rational? or organized?  Possibly the same reason I love psychoactive mindbenders (by this,  of course, I refer to puzzles and games like scrabble!) Because true beauty in life exposes itself  not in the routine, as religious dogma might promise, but at an Indian buffet at which one can  stand before a plethora of unfamiliar treasures, waiting for the unfamiliar perspective of a  Western mind for validation. what else?  I think this weekend I'm going to stimulate myself with  something organic - or possibly inorganic - and clean up the house. Make normal people  sense of the place so that when Mom and Dad show up tomorrow they don't swallow their  tongues. Music makes everything voluptuous, adds another layer to experiences so that they  find their way to memory lane more frequently and effectively. Takeover from an armchair. Natural delicacies. TV numbs, music accentuates, pleasure reading enriches, highest level math  and science is God. School puts the kind of pressure on people that creates Ted Bundies. UT is  anything but a good school, just like college immidiately following high school is anything but a  good idea. Just going doesn't plant seeds of positivity or success. I was the fool, caught in the  wave of college matriculation, and still to this day I feel I need four more years. Just like that  fucking idiot GW Bush. Right now, and not because I endorse the use of any of the following  terms, I'm going to type into this mind drain a slew of derrogatory or defamatory terms that I  rarely use but that for some reason are to come out when I open the floodgates. It's because I  wanted to call Bush a faggot, or a fucking idiot, or a fucking shithead hyppocrite, but some  mechanism that pisses on creativity and ultimate truth caught me in the act and slapped my red  hand before any other utterance could follow. Well, here, you fuck, stop this!!!!  Oh, I was going  to go into some racial slurs, but that's just so stupid. How about cracker-ass whitebread honky  guerro americano puto!  that would be perfect for me. Still, something about WASPy racial slurs  isn't nearly as intimidating as ""nigger"" or ""spic"" or daggerhead, or whatever. This world exists  as a cesspool of religious dogma, hate, and a need to evolve. It's going to suck till that evolution  takes place, but God Damn it, I'll wallow in the shit till I die and I'll like it.

"  This is a complex and controversial topic that has no definitive answer. Different parents may have different views and preferences on how to raise their children and teach them financial responsibility. However, based on the information I found online, here are some possible pros and cons of giving children an allowance:  Pros:  It can teach children the value of money and how to budget, save and spend wisely1234. It can give children a sense of autonomy and independence to make their own choices123. It can motivate children to do well in school or complete chores if the allowance is tied to performance or behavior14. It can foster financial literacy and prepare children for the real world15. Cons:  It can create a sense of entitlement or dependency on parents for money623. It can reduce the intrinsic motivation or enjoyment of learning or doing chores if the allowance is seen as the only reward623. It can lead to poor spending habits or conflicts if parents have no control or guidance over how the allowance is used613. It can emphasize too much on the money aspect of an allowance and neglect other values or skills65. Ultimately, parents should do what they think is best for their children and their family situation. Some possible tips to make an allowance more effective are125:  Set clear rules and expectations for how the allowance is earned, given and used. Involve children in the decision-making process and explain the reasons behind the allowance system. Be consistent and fair with the allowance amount and frequency. Encourage children to save, invest or donate a portion of their allowance for long-term goals or causes. Review and adjust the allowance system as children grow older or circumstances change.           ",1
"I guess the way I feel right now is overwhelmed. I just came back from a class of 540 students, which is double the number of kids in my whole graduating class. Although there are many students here who are so excited to be away from home and all on their own I wouldn't mind going back home and staying their for a while. I am very pleased with my life at home and this sudden change has left me to start all over. Although I know this is a part of life I feel as thought I am losing some of my childhood friends yet no one is replacing them. At first I told myself that is just how I feel and if those childhood friends felt the same then I might be right but this whole summer all of my high school friends were ready to leave for college. Now that we are all separated we understand how much we depended on each other. I have been here three days and everyday for at least an hour I have talked to my friend back home. I guess what scares me the most is that when you meet someone here you have no idea where they came from, where they have been, or what type of person they are. Back at home we all knew each others families, knew what type of person they where etc. I can truly same that moving to Austin has definitely made me reevaluate myself. Not to be cocky but back at home everyone knew who I was and what type of person I was, but here everyone thinks I am a nobody. I feel as thought I have to impress someone for him or her to approach me where at home others approached me. I guess the comfort of home was my stability and now that I am here I have to build a new foundation to start from. I am very great full that there is one other person from my school here because we are together all the time and it makes this transition just a bit easier. Now that we have started classes I am trying to busy myself with my work, which is, a good thing and then it seem as thought time goes by a lot faster. I think I just have to mental got myself ready for this semester and then I will be fine. I do like challenges and that is why I came to this university but the challenges I expected are not the ones I am having trouble adjusting too. It is completely different aspects of college life that has thrown me off.",0

"Ok, it is 2:02 in the morning and I don't even know why I am doing this assignment --- I just spend over an hour doing the experiment pretesting and I should have gone to bed before I even started doing that, considering the faxct that it is not due for a while. but, I guess it is good that I did it now cause I tend to procrastinate and I probably would have ended up on the due day trying to get connected to the sight and have 40 million other people trying the same thing --- connecting to these sights are so ridiculous - it was impossible to get through the ut main sight to register for classes -- I'm spelling sight the wrong way, I think - spelling is one of my worst subjects, derek always makes fun of me for the way I spell and how I am the only graduate of high school who can't spell the simplest words (for example, that one!)  he also laughs cause I always say periferial vision the wrong way --- he's so smart, he makes me sick, I don't know what I would do if I were that smart - I guess that I could do anything that I wanted to, and I guess he sort of does too, he went to school last year and partied all the time and still got higher than a 3. 5 - that's what I got in high school, and I admit that I didn't study, but I also didn't go out every night - I guess I just procrastinated and pretended like I had more to do than I really did, but then all of the work piled up and I really did end up to have lots to do, but I also let the work pile up because I was talking to derek on the phone ---- my parents almost killed me because of the phone bill, and made me pay for it - and it was so expensive! my phone bill is already going to be skyrocketting and I have only been here for a week and a half, but most of it is to my parents, so that will be acceptable to them cause they were the ones who wanted to find out what rush was and how it went and they wanted every single detail, so I guess I can't really get in trouble!  ok, it is 2:09 and I don't have anything to write about already - I guess I have a short attention span casue this was fun at first and now I would rather go and call derek and talk to him on the phone, or check my email or something - I am so proud that I am actually trying to do my work ahead of time, then again this is the fun homework and I always get the fun stuff done first and then have all of the bad and boring stuff left till the end - if I type fast, which I think I do, I am going to have ended up typing a lot more stuff in 20 minutes than other people would have, and that's not really fair, but that's ok, cause I talk a lot and am sure that I will find stuff to talk about even if it is not in any kind of readable and understandable form ---- I don't like puncuation - I just like dashes like a thought afterwards or something, though that is normally what it is, I also don't like to capitalize a lot if I am writing something really fast and not stopping, so that is why this is not capitalized and has lots of hyphens, they are just more fun --- I wonder who was the first person who evewr thought to make little faces out of the symbols on the keyboard, I mnean, who sits down at his/her computer and looks at all of the punctuation keys, ect. and thinks, oh that would make a smiley face, ect?  the icq smiley faces are better than the ones on aol cause they automatically turn into the stereotypical yellow smiley face instead of the actual punctuation marks - derek bought boxers with me that were joe boxer once, and that was kind of embarrasing cause there was an old lady right there and I didn't want her to think that we were doing inappropriate things and that I was just used to seeing his boxers all of the time, so I pretended I was his sister, though that's what I feel like anyway - we have known eachother for so long, told eachother so many things, and done so much with each other that we are just like brother and sister - I don't know what I am going to do next year, I guess I can just I'm him, but that's never as good as talking on the phone and the international calls would get me killed, but I can't stand the thought of not hearing his voice and all of the different inflections therein!  how sad! I guess I won't think of that for now, but that's just going to make it worse next year, but then again, maybe we will have gotten in some huge fight and not be talking by then, which would of course e bad, but on the other hand, it could be good cause then I would not be wishing that I was talking to him - ok, I forgot what time I started writing this and it is 2:18 I think it was 2:05 - oh no I think it was 2:02 --- I am going to cheat and stop to look at what time it is for the sake of my poor hands that are getting ready to fall off - I need to get back into the habit of typing, though it was so hard for me not to be typing in classes today and yesterday - I have no hope of keeping up while I am taking notes by hand, I am just not used to it - there was one guy in my chem class taking notes on his laptop, so maybe I'll bring mine next time so that I will actually leave with good notes, but chem is the worst class to bring the laptop to cause there are lots of charts and drrawings ect. that take me too long to do on the laptop that I would have to do on paper, leave space on the word processor, print it out and then copy the picture back to the other sheet, but I don't htink I would do that, or I guess that I would wnat to - iam getting sleepy and want to go to sleep - my roommate goes to bed too early and has classes too early and I feel badly keeping her up, but she said that she was a night person and I todl her that I definitely was, and I guess she'll have to get used to it, but I still feel badly --- it is now 2:22 and I forgot to look and see waht time I started so I guess I willl look now and if it was at 2:02 I will not write any more and if it was at :05 then I will have 3 minutes left to write - is that right? I am so bad at mental math - derek is so good at it, he makes me sick - I can't do anything in my head and he can do more in his head than I can with the calculator, but that's ok I can do things that he can't so I guess we have to even out sometime - I guess that I will check the time now.",0
" On the one hand, the law does not prevent individuals with criminal records from running for office in most countries. Disqualifying someone from running for office based solely on their criminal history could be seen as discriminatory, especially if the crime was non-violent or unrelated to their ability to carry out the duties of the office they are seeking. Additionally, some people may argue that individuals who have overcome their past mistakes and demonstrated rehabilitation should not be punished indefinitely for their past actions.  On the other hand, allowing candidates with criminal records to run for office may undermine the public's trust in the political system. Voters may question the integrity and suitability of someone with a criminal record to hold a position of power and make decisions that affect the lives of others. In some cases, a candidate's criminal record may also create a conflict of interest, such as a lawmaker with a history of financial fraud making decisions related to finance and business regulations.  There have been numerous examples of politicians with criminal records being elected to office, including former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, who was convicted of tax fraud and sentenced to four years in prison, and former Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick, who served time for perjury and obstruction of justice. These cases highlight the complex issues involved in allowing candidates with criminal records to run for office.  Ultimately, the decision to allow candidates with criminal records to run for office should be weighed carefully, taking into account the nature of the crime, the individual's demonstrated rehabilitation, and the potential impact on the public's trust in the political system. It may also be beneficial for countries to establish clear guidelines and regulations regarding the eligibility of individuals with criminal records to run for office.         ",1
"Is U. T. for me? Should I have stayed with my friends in Houston? I thought I was going to meet to meet a lot of new people here. I don't know what to do? Why am I here?

"Right now, I am feeling a little tired, a little overwhelmed, excited, and also a little afraid. I am tired both because of lack of sleep and because of exercise. I am feeling a little overwhelmed because of all the new surroundings and situations that I have found myself in in the last couple of weeks. Its not really that I am overloaded with work (yet), it is just that I am still getting used to everything here: new and different classes, new ways of studying and testing, new teachers and techniques of teaching, etc. I am also overwhelmed with the new social surroundings: a new room, roommate, sleeping schedule, eating schedule, etc. I am excited because I think I am going to enjoy living and going to school here. I am excited about taking courses that I'm actually interested in, and about having teachers that enjoy their profession and know what they are doing. I am excited about meeting new people. One of the things that I enjoy most about Austin is the diversity of the people you can find here. No matter what kind of person you are, you can find someone similar to you who share the same interests and concerns. I have already met some very fascinating people. Austin is an exciting place to live even if you are not attending the University. If I'm not mistaken, it is the music capitol of the world. I could go on for a long time about all the reasons why I am excited. I am afraid mainly for the same reasons that I am overwhelmed. Mostly I am afraid that I do not know how to take notes and study properly. I find myself looking at others people's notes during lecture to see if I am writing down the important things and whether or not I am getting the point. My mom says that in time, I will learn what to write down, read, and study. I have never been a very good test taker. My biggest fear of all is the fact that I have always relied on the one on one attention that I received from my teachers in the past to get me through school. Now that I am attending the largest University in the county, I know that that is impractical. However, I plan on taking all advantages offered to me by my teachers and their aids. With an average of 540 students in your classes, I know that you cannot offer that same oneonone environment. That is my greatest concern.",0
" Diversity is a term that has many meanings and applications in different contexts. In general, diversity refers to the condition, fact, or quality of being different, varied, or composed of many different elements or types1. Diversity can be seen in various aspects of human life, such as culture, ethnicity, race, gender, sexuality, religion, age, ability, and more. Diversity can also be applied to other domains, such as biology, ecology, politics, education, and art.  Diversity is important for several reasons. First, diversity reflects the reality of the world we live in, where people have different backgrounds, experiences, perspectives, and identities. Recognizing and respecting diversity can help us to understand and appreciate the richness and complexity of human society. Second, diversity can foster creativity, innovation, and problem-solving by bringing together different ideas and approaches. Diversity can also challenge stereotypes and prejudices and promote critical thinking and dialogue. Third, diversity can enhance social justice and equity by ensuring that everyone has equal opportunities and access to resources and rights. Diversity can also empower marginalized groups and amplify their voices and contributions.  However, diversity also poses some challenges and conflicts. Diversity can sometimes create misunderstandings, tensions, and divisions among people who have different views or interests. Diversity can also be threatened by discrimination, oppression, or violence that aim to exclude or harm certain groups or individuals. Diversity can also be misused or exploited for political or economic purposes that do not benefit the common good.  Therefore, diversity requires awareness, education, and action to be valued and protected. Diversity requires us to recognize and respect the differences among us without denying our common humanity. Diversity requires us to celebrate and learn from the variety of cultures and experiences that enrich our lives. Diversity requires us to work together to overcome the barriers and challenges that prevent us from achieving a more inclusive and harmonious society.  In conclusion, diversity is a multifaceted concept that has many implications for human life. Diversity is both a source of strength and a challenge for our society. Diversity is not something that we can ignore or take for granted; it is something that we need to embrace and nurture for the benefit of ourselves and others.    ",1
" The question of whether Congress should pass legislation requiring automobile manufacturers to use more fuel-efficient engines is a highly debated one. On one hand, the popularity of sport utility vehicles (SUVs) has led to increased consumption of fuel and higher greenhouse gas emissions, which contributes to climate change. On the other hand, some argue that government intervention in the automotive industry is unnecessary and could have negative economic impacts.  There are several reasons why a law requiring automobile manufacturers to use more fuel-efficient engines could be beneficial. First and foremost, it could help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate the effects of climate change. According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), transportation is the largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions in the United States, with cars and trucks accounting for about one-fifth of the country's total emissions. By increasing fuel efficiency, automobile manufacturers could help reduce these emissions and make a significant impact in the fight against climate change.  Furthermore, a law requiring more fuel-efficient engines could also help reduce our dependence on foreign oil. The United States imports about 40% of the oil it consumes, and transportation accounts for about 70% of that consumption. By increasing fuel efficiency, we could decrease our demand for foreign oil and become more energy independent.  However, there are also potential drawbacks to passing such a law. For example, it could increase the cost of vehicles and reduce consumer choice. In addition, some argue that the free market should be left to determine the most efficient and cost-effective solutions, rather than government mandates.  In conclusion, the question of whether Congress should pass legislation requiring automobile manufacturers to use more fuel-efficient engines is a complex one. While there are potential benefits to increasing fuel efficiency, there are also potential drawbacks to government intervention in the automotive industry. Ultimately, the decision on whether or not to pass such a law will require careful consideration of all the potential impacts, both positive and negative.  ",1
"I guess I have no started my 20 minutes of writing for the psychology class. As I'm writing I keep on looking at the clock to see what time it is to see when I'm supposed to finish typing. I think about what I was thinking in class when you talked to us about this HW and how I wanted to talk about certain things while I was doing. But actually I start thinking about what happened tonight. We all hung out with the fraternity and just bonded by going to dinner and then going to just talk and catch up on everything we did over the summer and afterwards we played capture the flag. I wish my roommate would listen to better music. After capture the flag we all decided to go swimming instead of capture the flag because we had all gotten tired. We put it to the vote and that's what we ended up doing. Afterwards our President asked us to make this a dry event. I support him 100% because one I don't drink, two I don't think that it is necessary to drink to have a good time, and three I think that all the points that he made were very strong. My roommates had a problem with it because we are all part of the executive board and we thought that before saying that he should have asked us all instead of doing it by himself. I think that they are wrong anyhow because as President I think that Ted did the right thing in telling us not to drink and I don't think that there was a need for him to consult us. It was an executive decision. I'm debating whether I should go outside to the pool with everyone else when I'm done with that. I was supposed to get together with a friend of mine tonight but we have been playing phone tag so it's not going to happen but I will see her on Monday so I'm still happy. This weekend I have lots of things to do. I'm running through my schedule for the weekend. Tomorrow I have to meet for lunch with a friend and afterwards we are going to the lake to just hang out. I keep on thinking about what else I'm going to write and how interesting this paper really is. I have never really sat down and typed everything I'm thinking but at the same time many of my teachers have always told me that I type just like I think; this causes my grades in grammar to be much lower. My leg really hurt because me and one of my roommates were messing around and we both deadlegged each other. But after the pain that we have both caused we have promised each other that we will never do that again. We'll see if we actually will keep it but I think we will. I'm the only one in the apartment right now cause everyone else is outside. I think about everything else I could have done tonight but in all honesty the last thing I really wanted to do was to go out and actually do something. I am very happy with the way that the evening turned out even though I would still have liked to see my friend tonight. I kind of like this girl but I'm not sure. She's cute and everything but we haven't really gotten to know each other well enough to where I can say that I like her but I do think that she's kind of interested. I also think about my friend who is coming up from Southwest next week to come see and how she's going to spend the night. We have been friends for a long time and we get along great. But the thing is that we both have really flirty personalities so I'm kind of wondering if anything is going to happen. I know that it can't be too much because I have a lot of selfcontrol but at the same time I don't want thing to get weird or to have a girlfriend right now. If anything happens it will just be maybe a little cuddling here and there or maybe a kiss. We will most likely end up sleeping in the same bed but we'll see. I have the full intention of not having sex. I never have and never will until the day I get married. I have thought about being a priest for a long time so I'm just waiting for God to give me my call and I will follow His will. I really hope that he hurries up though cause I don't have a lot of patience. I think that I have a lot of qualities but patience is not one of them. I can be patient for certain things but I just hate waiting for people to give me an answer. I know that God doesn't count in that but I try to hurry Him up. One of my friends told me this summer that if you ever wanted to make God laugh all you had to do was to tell Him your plans. I'm wondering whether this will mean anything to you guys. I guess that it all depends on whether you are Christian or Catholic or simply don't believe in God or have another religion. I realize that there are a lot of people here at UT that simply doesn't believe in God and I think that that is really sad because they are missing out on a great part of life. I keep on looking at the clock and seeing how much time is left. I wish that everyone would be able to believe in God and receive the Eucharist everyday. It is the most amazing gift that God gave us. It's sad how some people just ignore God or sometimeseven laugh in His face. This was what I originally wanted to talk about when I was thinking about what I was going to write in this paper. I thought that it would be great thing to think about because there is so much that I can write on but then I realized that I couldn't do that because it would have been planned. So I decided to kind of clear my mind and just speak my mind. For the most part I think that it worked because as I think back of all the things that I have written for the past 20 minutes I have gone through various different topics. Ranging from drinking, to girls, to God. I think this was a really cool experiment and that other people should do it because it is a great way to realize what is going on in your head but also to help you put what goes through your mind in words. I realize that the time is up and that I no longer need to be writing but I'm also going to stop because my hands are really hurting. I notice that I almost finished a complete page of writing.",0
"the thought of everyone or anything making sense is no sense at all. people or things are living to be apart of the same things. to understand the most simplest of things is to want to understand the hardest of things. if we were to understand all that is around us then what? we seem as humans to conquer all that is unknown or well known as something we can overtake. why is this? if we understood everthing about ourselves then would we conquer overselves and in turn become so self absorbed that it turns out for the worst? maybe our own minds are the foundation and key to unlocking every mystery that lies in this world. that may be the reason that it is so complicated, since it does not want to be discovered in fear of damnation. we find ourselves seeking that which is not wanting to be sought after. maybe if we just left the hinding unknown come to the surface on its own then the world would be more peaceful than ever. we want to satisfy and gratify each other yet nothing is truly workin as a whole. in that case why don't we curse each other? would this work? there wouldn't be heroes without tragic situations that call on them. there wouldn't be compassion without suffering. this may be the other mystery of life. we suffer from all sorts of pains. anxiety, stress, and heartache. then this may be the key to how the  world goes round. there must always lie a purpose or mystery to be solved or individuals would possibly goe mad. living without purpose. the sights that are before us lie challenges that we all must go through. . animal. man. all the same in our   civilized  , yet primal instincts. we find that the more of one thing evolves another becomes a mystery. we try to understand our primal side of existance yet this is where we come from. our strive to learn, succeed, or conquer friends and foes. the animal coming out of us? no the animal coming back to us. these triumphes or downfalls are the minds tricks on itself that keeps everthing from total damnation. if we did unlock the nooks and crannies of our world then what then. find a way to kill or destroy it. with everything else we have. from finding how the world turns, our habits have caused an imbalance of many levels. the people all around us are capable of so much together that the universe wouldn't stand a chance. but that may be the reason we coannot truly get the whole picture of how we really feel for one another. the thoughts that we have are very primal. we seek out our sexes to comfort a zone but not a domain. if we all truly united then our common strength could destroy rntire galaxies since we have already done fractions of that with partial unification. this may be the clue to how realtionships may work in general. we find ways to unite and ways to spread out. everything that may be silly to an outsider like colthes, sex, or religion. these pose for issues that seperarte us at the same time. the same that our animal instincts may tell us as they come back and not come out as many think. think about the possibilities. or the downfalls. mysteries of any sort are our key that may never be unlocked",0
"  Sibling rivalry is common in many families, and it can lead to various problems and conflicts among siblings. Some of the common issues that arise from discord between siblings include:  Constant Fighting: When siblings do not get along, it can lead to constant arguing and fighting, which can disrupt the harmony of the family.  Jealousy: Siblings may feel jealous of one another, especially if they feel that one sibling is receiving more attention or praise than the other.  Lack of Trust: Sibling rivalry can also erode the trust between siblings, making it difficult for them to rely on each other.  Divided Family: If the conflict between siblings becomes too intense, it can lead to a division within the family, where siblings take sides and form their own alliances.  To handle a situation like this, it is essential to approach the problem with empathy, respect, and understanding. Here are some ways to address the issues arising from discord between siblings:  Encourage Communication: Encourage siblings to communicate with each other and express their feelings without fear of judgment or criticism. Parents can create a safe space for siblings to talk to each other and share their thoughts.  Avoid Taking Sides: Parents should avoid taking sides and treat each sibling equally, especially during conflicts. They can mediate and facilitate communication, but they should not favor one sibling over the other.  Teach Conflict Resolution Skills: Parents can teach their children how to resolve conflicts in a healthy and productive manner. This includes teaching them how to listen actively, negotiate, compromise, and apologize.  Promote Positive Sibling Relationships: Parents can promote positive sibling relationships by encouraging siblings to spend time together and participate in activities they enjoy. This can help them bond and develop a deeper understanding of each other.  In conclusion, sibling rivalry can create various problems within a family, but it is possible to address them with empathy, understanding, and communication. Parents can play a crucial role in facilitating healthy sibling relationships by promoting positive interactions and teaching conflict resolution skills.            ",1
"  On the one hand, the principle of ""an eye for an eye"" is often associated with retributive justice, which seeks to punish offenders in a way that is proportional to the harm they have caused. Supporters of this approach argue that it can serve as a deterrent to future crime and can provide a sense of closure to victims and their families. For example, in some cultures, the death penalty is seen as an appropriate punishment for murder because it reflects the seriousness of the crime.  On the other hand, critics of the ""an eye for an eye"" approach argue that it can lead to a cycle of violence and perpetuate a culture of revenge. Punishing someone in the same way they harmed another person may not actually restore justice or promote healing, but instead simply cause more harm. Additionally, determining an appropriate punishment based solely on the harm caused can be difficult and subjective, as factors such as intention, context, and mitigating circumstances may need to be taken into account. For example, a person who steals to feed their family may not deserve the same punishment as someone who steals out of greed.  Ultimately, the appropriateness of the ""an eye for an eye"" principle as a basis for determining punishment depends on one's personal beliefs about the purpose of justice and the role of punishment. Some may see it as a necessary form of retribution, while others may view it as a flawed approach that perpetuates harm rather than promoting healing and restoration.   ",1
" based on my vast knowledge, there is a book that I would recommend to everyone: ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" by Harper Lee.  ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" is a classic novel published in 1960 that tells the story of a young girl, Scout Finch, growing up in the Southern United States during the 1930s. The novel explores themes of racism, injustice, and prejudice through the lens of Scout's experiences as she witnesses her father, a lawyer named Atticus Finch, defend a black man, Tom Robinson, who has been wrongly accused of a crime.  The novel is an American literary masterpiece that has been widely read and celebrated for over half a century. It has won numerous awards and accolades, including the Pulitzer Prize, and has been translated into more than 40 languages. Despite its age, the book remains incredibly relevant today, particularly in light of ongoing issues with racial inequality and social justice.  One of the reasons that ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" is such an important book is because it forces readers to confront the difficult and uncomfortable truths about the history of race relations in the United States. Through its characters and storylines, the novel shows the ways in which racism and prejudice have been deeply ingrained in American society for generations, and how they continue to shape our world today.  At the same time, however, ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" is also a deeply moving and engaging story. The novel is written from Scout's perspective, and readers are able to follow her growth and development as she begins to understand the complexities of the world around her. The novel is filled with memorable characters, including Atticus Finch, who is widely regarded as one of the greatest heroes in American literature.  Reading ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" can be a transformative experience. It challenges readers to think critically about their own beliefs and biases, and to consider the ways in which they might be contributing to social injustice. It also offers hope and inspiration, showing how one person can make a difference in the world by standing up for what is right.  In conclusion, ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" is a book that should be required reading for everyone. Its timeless message about the importance of justice, equality, and compassion is as relevant today as it was when it was first published over 60 years ago. By reading this book, we can all gain a deeper understanding of our shared history and work towards building a better future for ourselves and our communities.         ",1
"This week has been so overwhelming!  I have taken in so much and my mind feels like it is in overdrive. I already feel stress and the semester has barely begun. I want to be involved in a many ways as I possibly can, but there are so many organizations to join, I don't know what to choose. The difference between college and high school is readily apparent. I hope as time goes by, I will develop better study habits and get used to waking up early. I am extremely nervous about the first exam in all of my classes because I do not know what kind of questions the professor will ask, and therefore, do not know how to prepare for them. Tonight I am glad that I get to go out and do something because I feel so couped up here in this dorm room studying all week. I am also excited about seeing my boyfriend and cousins this weekend. Everytime he calls, I light up with happiness. No matter what kind of day I am having, I always feel better when he calls. I still miss my ex very much though. Two years is hard to let go of especially when they have been your friend for an even longer period of time. I wish he would just call me because I really want to talk to him. We used to talk every night for hours and hours. He was such a big part of my life and now I barely see him, let alone talk to him. I think that he is mad at me because I am dating someone else, but I'm not sure. He usually returns my calls, but I have not talked to him in like 4 days. I am really hungry and I would love a big bowl of icecream. but I can't have one. I am really trying to stick to this stupid diet because of all of the ""freshman 15"" horror stories. I wish I had more time to take a nap during the day, but when I'm not studying, I'm working out or running errands. Another thing I'm worried about is having two finals on one day. My mythology and calculus finals are right after one another and they are both very demanding courses. Oh well, I guess I just have to make the best of it because there is nothing I can do about it. Thank god I don't have three on the same day--then, I would really panic. I'm thankful to have Julio because he really pushes me and encourages me when  I am doubtful or discouraged. I miss him so much more than I thought I would. I have only been with him for a month, but I already feel attached. I hope my parents like him when they meet him this weekend. Hes so smart and has good manners. Their approval means a lot to me and I guess Ill find out what they think of Julio this weekend",0

" Choosing a pet that matches your lifestyle is important to ensure that you can provide it with the care and attention it needs. Here are some steps you can take to choose a pet that suits your lifestyle:  Consider your living situation: Different pets have different space requirements, so consider your living situation before choosing a pet. If you live in a small apartment, a large dog may not be the best choice, but a small dog or a cat could work well.  Think about your daily routine: If you have a busy schedule and are not home much, a pet that requires a lot of attention, such as a dog or a bird, may not be the best choice. A cat, fish or a reptile that requires less interaction may be a better fit.  Consider your activity level: If you enjoy being active and spending time outdoors, a dog may be a great choice. If you prefer a more relaxed lifestyle, a cat or a small animal like a hamster or a rabbit may be a better fit.  Research different breeds or species: Different breeds of dogs or species of animals have different personality traits, energy levels, and care requirements. Take the time to research different options and choose a pet that matches your lifestyle.  Visit a shelter or rescue organization: Consider adopting a pet from a shelter or rescue organization.

By following these steps, you can choose a pet that will be a good match for your lifestyle and provide you with years of companionship and joy.     ",1
"I am thinking about an email I just read. It's from a friend from a      kickboxing class. He was giving me a hard time, Which is fine because I make fun of him too. He's a pretty funny guy but I am really trying to come up with a good joke to really bust his chops. I am also thinking about  how depressed everyone is today, being September 11th and all. I wonder how Sept. 11th will be in like 50 years. I also wonder how long it will take for it to get into student's text books. I hope they don't do the same thing that they did for Pearl Harbor and Titanic, and make a love story out of it. That's rediculous, there is more to it than some guy going off to work while his wife is at home and his lover is at his secret apartment. I bet a lot of people will be angry if someone manages to come up with one. I would hate to be President Bush now. He has some tough decisions to make. Half of the country says: Kill 'em all! While the others are screaming:   PEACE.   No matter what, someone will not get what they want. Even in the West Mall today, there are tons of people speaking their opinion, showing signs and passing out ribbons. But it's not totally black and white. I think there is a grey area. Some people say war and some say peace, but I think we can find some in-between. Killing innocent children isn't a good idea but we have to stand up for ourselves if we want this to stop. I don't know. . I don't like talking about politics or religion. Too much controversy. Everyone is too stubborn to see the sides of others. I am also thinking about when I was here in the computer lab yesterday. Some girl started crying really loud in the hallway. It was just like out of the movies. None of us knew what was going on. Some people got up and went to see, which (although curious myself) I thought was rude. I went to my kickboxing class last night. It really makes me feel self-confident. Learning those moves last night was a lot of fun. Why isn't the time and minutes thing doing anything? I am afraid that I will have to do this all over again. I am looking around the room and noticing that just about everyone here is checking their email. I guess no one does work on computers!!!  I like coming in here to check my email but I always feel like someone is reading what I am typing behind me. If they want to know so bad, they should just ask. I am very tired. I went to bed late, and slept through my alarm. But somehow I still made it to my 9:00 class. Barely! That class is fun. Learning sign language is very important I think. Just as important as learning Spanish or French or something. Going to the social events will be sort of weird though. Since I am not very good at signing, I will pretty much be a wall flower.",0
" Cooperation is the act or situation of working or acting together for a common benefit or goal1. It can involve association, joint effort, or assistance from persons or organizations12. It can also be a combination of persons for purposes of production, purchase, or distribution1. Cooperation can be helpful, wanted, or effective1.  To me, cooperation means being willing to cooperate with others, respecting their opinions and perspectives, and contributing to the shared outcome. It means being open-minded, flexible, and supportive of others’ ideas and efforts. It also means being accountable for my own actions and responsibilities, and accepting feedback and criticism.  Cooperation is important for many reasons. First, it can help achieve goals that are too complex or difficult for one person or group to accomplish alone. For example, cooperation can enable scientific discoveries, technological innovations, artistic creations, and social movements that require collaboration and coordination among different disciplines, sectors, or countries. Second, cooperation can foster positive relationships and trust among people who have different backgrounds, beliefs, or interests. For example, cooperation can promote mutual understanding, tolerance, and respect among people who have different cultures, religions, or political views. Third, cooperation can enhance personal growth and development by exposing oneself to new perspectives, experiences, and challenges. For example, cooperation can stimulate learning, creativity, problem-solving, and communication skills that are essential for personal and professional success.  In conclusion, cooperation is a valuable skill and attitude that can benefit oneself and others in various ways. It can help achieve common goals, build positive relationships, and enhance personal growth. Cooperation is not always easy or natural, but it is worth practicing and improving because it can make a difference in the world.  ",1
" Kettering's statement implies that progress comes with challenges and difficulties, which is often true. Many technological advancements have brought significant benefits to society but also caused problems and challenges that needed to be addressed.  For example, the development of the automobile revolutionized transportation and helped people travel more efficiently and comfortably. However, it also brought challenges such as air pollution, traffic congestion, and accidents that needed to be addressed through regulation and innovation.  Similarly, the rise of the internet and digital technology has transformed the way we live, work, and communicate. But it also brings challenges like online privacy, cybercrime, and addiction.  Therefore, while progress has undoubtedly brought many benefits, it has also caused problems that require solutions. To minimize the negative impact of progress, it is essential to anticipate and address the challenges that may arise. It is important to develop policies and regulations to ensure that the benefits of progress are widely shared and that the adverse effects are mitigated.  In conclusion, progress indeed comes with challenges and difficulties, as Charles F. Kettering said. However, it is possible to manage and address these challenges through innovation, regulation, and collaboration.     ",1
"right now I'm thinking about how I don't want to do this I just want to get to new mexico and start hunting. this is the fifteenth year me and my dad have been doing this. it all started when I was 3 I can remember my first time of course I didn't shoot anything that year just kind of watched but it was still fun. I'm also excited that my best bud justin gets to go with us I met him at church camp my freshman year of high school. he's not from kerrville he's from boerne but after that first year we were always kicking it together every weekend. we have had some fun times parties, going wakeboarding at the lake, snow skiing, spring break at south padre. its all good. well back to hunting now, its a good drive and here I am stuck doing my homework instead of driving in the car, I wish I had a lap top then I could do this while I was driving.

" On one hand, zoos have been an educational tool for many people around the world. They allow people to observe and learn about animals they may not otherwise have the opportunity to see. Zoos also contribute to conservation efforts, by supporting research and breeding programs to help endangered species. Additionally, many zoos work to provide habitats that mimic the animals' natural environments as closely as possible, ensuring their physical and mental wellbeing.  On the other hand, there are valid concerns about the welfare of animals kept in captivity. Some animals may become stressed, develop abnormal behaviors, or suffer from physical and psychological health problems due to the restricted living conditions in zoos. Furthermore, the process of capturing and transporting animals to zoos can be traumatic, leading to injury or death. Some critics argue that zoos prioritize entertainment over the welfare of animals.  In conclusion, there are valid arguments on both sides of this debate. While zoos can provide educational opportunities and contribute to conservation efforts, it is important to ensure that animals in captivity are treated humanely and provided with adequate living conditions. It is up to individuals to consider these factors when deciding whether or not to support zoos.     ",1
"  This is a complex and controversial topic that has many arguments for and against it. I will try to summarize some of the main points from both sides, but I encourage you to do your own research and form your own opinion.  Some of the pros of single-sex schools are:  They may reduce distractions and peer pressure from the opposite gender, especially during adolescence. They may allow teachers to use gender-specific teaching methods and tailor the curriculum to the needs and interests of their students. They may foster more confidence and leadership skills among girls and boys, who can see themselves as role models and achievers in various fields. They may challenge gender stereotypes and expectations, and encourage students to explore a wider range of subjects and activities. Some of the cons of single-sex schools are:  They may not prepare students well for the real world, where men and women work and interact together in diverse settings. They may reinforce gender segregation and discrimination, and limit the opportunities for social and emotional development of students. They may be based on questionable assumptions about natural differences between males and females, which may vary depending on individual factors and environmental influences. They may ignore or exclude students who do not fit into the binary categories of male or female, or who identify as transgender or non-binary. These are some of the pros and cons of single-sex schools, based on the information I found in 1234. However, there may be other factors to consider, such as the quality of the school, the availability of resources, the preferences of the parents and students, and the legal and ethical implications of single-sex education. Ultimately, the best choice depends on what works best for each student and their educational goals.🎓        ",1
" The question of whether schools should play classical music during exams or allow students to listen to it on headphones is a complex one, and there are arguments on both sides. On the one hand, research has shown that classical music can have a positive effect on concentration, memory, and overall academic performance. It has been suggested that the music's calming effect can help reduce stress and anxiety, which may improve performance on exams.  However, it's essential to note that music can also be a source of distraction, especially if the student doesn't enjoy classical music or if the volume is too high. Some students may find it difficult to focus with any background noise, while others may find the music itself distracting and may struggle to concentrate on the exam.  In light of these considerations, schools should consider a middle ground approach that takes into account the needs and preferences of individual students. For example, they could provide a quiet exam environment for those who prefer it, while also allowing students who find classical music helpful to listen to it on headphones. Additionally, schools could consider offering students the option to choose whether they want to listen to classical music during exams, rather than making it a mandatory practice.  In conclusion, the effects of classical music on exam performance are still not fully understood, and the impact may vary from person to person. Therefore, schools should consider a flexible approach that accommodates students' diverse preferences and needs to ensure the best possible learning outcomes.    ",1
"I'm hungry, but I don't have any of the food I normally eat. If I had a car, I'd go to the grocery store and buy myself some more Myoplex (protein shakes) and some cereal and some milk, but my parents heard too many horror stories about first year college students flunking out of school because they drove their roommate to wrestling matches and out-of-town football games and such, so they wouldn't let me bring my car this semester. If I had gone to school out of state, like both my brother and sister did before me, I wouldn't be getting a car for the entire first year, but since my school tuition is roughly one third of what theirs was, and I have some scholarships on top of that, my parents are considering letting me bring my car to Austin at semester. I really don't know where there's room to park a Ford Expedition in this town, but I'll find some place. My car would have been nice to have last last Sunday morning, because there was a rowing team meeting at the boathouse, which is too far to walk to, and I ended up not being able to go because I couldn't find a ride. I was pretty upset, but My R. A. Danny, the one who talked me into trying out for the rowing team, told me to go to practice this morning anyway, and the coaches wouldn't mind. He was right. I just added my name to their list of names that they got at different meetings that I wasn't able to attend, went through the workout, and they told me to come back on Wednesday. It was a lot tougher than I would have thought, in some respects, but a lot less strenuous in others, when I look back at it. The one mile jog wasn't hard at all, and neither were the pull-ups, but eventually the sit-ups wore me out, and the jump-squats actually made me nauseous after a few sets. I think that's mainly because my legs were really sore from the gym the day before, which was a bad move on my part, but it's hard to say. I've never done jump-squats before, so I might have felt sick afterwards without being sore. We didn't get to go out on the water, which was somewhat disappointing, but the group of guys I was with are supposed to take a boat out on wednesday, while the other groups run body circuits, since that's all our group was able to do. We did actually take a boat down to the dock, and set it in the water, but I wasn't able to get in, and the boat never left the dock, so it wasn't as much fun as it could have been. I'm somewhat nervous about the next practice session. We get to use the rowing machines for the first time, and I've never used one before. I'm not sure if three sets of ten minutes is going to be a breeze, or if I'm really going to throw up this time. I work out 6 days a week, and I run, and most of my workouts are repetition, not heavy lifting, so I could definitely be in worse shape for rowing, but I'm still not sure how far away I am from the kind of endurance I need for the urgs"" (rowing machines. )  I would actually be stronger, but have less endurance if my shoulder hadn't been giving me problems all through high school. I pulled it while unloading some suitcases for some elderly friends at the New York airport after a two week cruise through Southern Europe. We went to the doctor, they told me to lay off it, and I did, but apparently it wasn't long enough. I was too anxious to get back in the gym, and I never let it heal completely, so about six months later I hurt it again. Six months after that, when it happened the third time, my parents took me to a doctor, and eventually to physical therapy. The therapist told me that my scapular region was too weak in comparison with my pectorals, triceps, biceps, and deltoids. Apparently I hadn't trained my back well enough to keep up with the rest of my upper body, which was causing my shoulders to carry all the strain of my movements, where the muscles in my back were supposed to be assisting the shoulder. The doctor was amazed that both shoulders hadn't been more severely damaged, but I was told that I wasn't beyond repair. A full month of therapy, very specific exercises, cross-friction massages, and ice massages helped a lot, but my shoulder is still pretty fragile. If I push myself too hard on the bench press, or if I don't put ice on my shoulder while stretching it for about ten minutes after every workout, it's sore for the next few days. I'm hoping that rowing will help develop the muscles in my back, especially the scapular region, so I can push myself harder at the gym when I'm training the rest of my upper body. The pull-ups we did the first day of training worked parts of my back that I can feel had been neglected, because the muscles were all tight and sore after only two sets of the pull-ups. Apparently some muscle somewhere in my back is getting some work, so I'm happy with the training so far. I was actually worried for a while that I wouldn't be able to train the rest of my body if I got serious rowing, but the coaches talked to us about how rowing really only works out your back and your biceps, so the rest of your body will need developing too, like your chest and triceps. This means I can still go to the gym, and I actually have more reason now than ever, because I have to keep my chest strong enough to balance with the back muscles that I will undoubtedly be developing. Running and jump-squats in training won't come anywhere close to giving me the leg workout I want, but I'm not sure when I'll be able to work legs without being sore at training the following day. I suppose that after a few weeks of real practice, assuming I make the team, I'll be able to decide when to work my legs, and how hard. Some of the guys there seemed to have been working out, or playing football in high school, because they were pretty used to running body-circuits, and jogging, and weren't too beat at the end of the day. Some of the other guys were obviously novices in the world of fitness. A few people vomited, one guy passed out, and I heard talk about a guy who was trying the rowing workout a few days ago who fell flat on his face and started convulsing. I'm not sure exactly what was going on there, but I'm glad nothing like that has happened to me yet. I can't wait for it to get cold outside, so I can actually stand in that boathouse without wanting to collapse. It was so hot and stuffy in there today that going outside in the 80 degree weather felt like walking into a refrigerator. Once it gets colder, I'm sure I'll have to buy a sweatshirt, and some warmer gym shorts, but the cold will be much more welcome than the hot sticky boathouse. It'll be a lot colder if I fall in the water too, but I'm hoping that won't happen too often.",0
"  Climate change is a global issue that affects everyone and everything on our planet. It’s caused by human activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes that release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. These gases trap heat from the sun and cause the Earth’s temperature to rise, leading to more frequent and severe weather events like hurricanes, droughts, and floods.  The consequences of climate change are far-reaching and devastating. They include rising sea levels that threaten coastal cities and island nations, loss of biodiversity as species struggle to adapt to changing conditions, and food and water shortages that could lead to conflict and displacement.  But there is hope. By taking action now to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions and transition to clean energy sources like wind and solar power, we can slow down the effects of climate change and protect our planet for future generations.  There are many ways you can get involved in the fight against climate change. You can reduce your own carbon footprint by driving less, eating a plant-based diet, and using energy-efficient appliances. You can also support policies that promote clean energy and protect natural resources.  I hope this essay has convinced you of the importance of taking action on climate change. Together, we can make a difference!            ",1
" There are arguments both for and against offering classes in a student's native language, and the decision ultimately depends on the goals of the educational system and the needs of the students.  On one hand, offering classes in a student's native language can provide important support for those who may struggle with English as a second language. These classes can help students better understand course material and allow them to participate more fully in classroom discussions, ultimately leading to greater success in their education. Additionally, maintaining proficiency in a native language can have cultural and personal benefits for students, allowing them to stay connected to their heritage and family members who may not speak English.  On the other hand, immersion in English can be a more effective way for students to learn the language and become more proficient. In some cases, offering classes in a student's native language can lead to a lack of motivation to learn English, which can ultimately hinder their ability to succeed in the broader society. Furthermore, if students do not learn English fluently, they may face difficulties later in life when trying to obtain employment or engage with the broader community.  In conclusion, the decision of whether to offer classes in a student's native language ultimately depends on the specific needs and goals of the student and the educational system. While offering support in a student's native language can provide important benefits, it is also important to prioritize language acquisition and ensure that students have the resources they need to become fluent in English.

"  Advocates of GMO labeling argue that consumers have a right to know what they are eating and to make informed choices about the foods they purchase. Without clear labeling, it is difficult for consumers to avoid GMOs if they wish to do so. Labeling would also provide transparency in the food industry, allowing consumers to hold companies accountable for their ingredients and production methods.  Additionally, some consumers are concerned about potential health and environmental risks associated with GMOs, and labeling would allow them to avoid products that contain these ingredients. This would also help address concerns about the long-term effects of GMOs on human health and the environment.  Opponents of GMO labeling argue that it would be costly and impractical for manufacturers to implement such a system. They also argue that there is no evidence that GMOs are harmful to human health or the environment, and that labeling would only stigmatize these products unfairly.  Furthermore, GMO labeling could create confusion and mistrust among consumers, leading them to avoid products that are safe and nutritious. For example, some products, such as papayas and soybeans, are genetically modified to resist disease and pests, making them safer and more sustainable than their non-GMO counterparts.  In conclusion, the debate over GMO labeling is complex and multifaceted, with valid arguments on both sides. Ultimately, the decision to require labeling should be based on a thorough examination of the scientific evidence and a consideration of the potential benefits and drawbacks for consumers, manufacturers, and the environment.

"I am the egg man whoo I am the egg man whoo i am the walrus coo coo cachoopp? and that girl with the intriguing eyes looked through my spectacles and I could sense her ability to discern my anxiety. she knew she was pretty, and my sudden glance away from her, told her exactly what I was thinking. just from one moment, a bug's seconds glance, I was ashamed. as if I had stumbled upon a lady, naked or something horrible that would define my clumsiness of timing. but its all the same if you don't mind dear reader. I'm just a bit antsy, anxious, looking for colors undiscovered of nature yet. I am positive God has a predestined pastel palette that he has not yet utilized. I mean who knows? with all the toxins in the air, it makes one wonder who is the greater painter of a sky or landscape, man or God? so my friend and I are walking in a park and I said, ""wow what pink skies, I am so amazed at the beauty that surrounds me at this moment, I mean its all celestial, you know all of it """"hey, want me to burst your bubble,?"" she says. ""I know I'm going to regret this, but yeah tell me why!,"" I said. ""its because of pollution. the gases in the air. "" and then everything drowned in the void of her gibberish, hogwash, drivel, and my subconscious began to speak for her almost. I wanted to believe that it was something supernatural. something that was not polluted or tainted by the industry of man's ambition and stuff. ""no"" I said. ""that's not true,"" I rebutted. ""because if you look at the painters of 18th century romanticism, you notice the Delacroix pinks and blues of paint in the skies. or Turner's exaggerated oranges and stuff ""she didn't know what I meant, and I don't think I was talking much sense either. but those faded or bleached greens never leave do they? the trees, like that of an oil painting. its all too much it seems for some, I guess even me. they, those greens, speak of nature's affinity with the species it serves, and the congruence of it all. I think that if she, my friend, would have told Vincent van Gogh that same monstrous factoid she had told me, I could probably imagine him in a self portrait without any ears at all. coo coo cachoop? that damn Beatles tune.",0
"I don't know I fell kind of weird talking to a computer. Well today has been a really strange day. I didn't start school until 2pm so that was great. It lets me get lots of sleep. I think if I didn't get enough sleep I would be more stressed out then what I already am. Ok feeling weird again. I don't know what to type about. Ok, well yesterday I realized this guy that has three classes with me. So that is kind of cool. I went up to him and talked to him and told him that he was in my two classes. We later found out we had another class together, Philosophy. It is such a big class, I was not surprised I never notice this guy was in my class. After that I went to read by Psychology book because I'm kind of behind on my reading. Today I finally caught up. I feel better in that sense, but I'm still behind in my other courses. It's really stressful to have so many classes at the same time. But I see other people and they seem to be doing less work then I am. They are either smarter than me or they or procrastinating. If none applies then I kind of feel sorry for them. This weekend I finally get to go home. I'm kind of happy to go back because I miss my baby sister. She is like one year old, so I hate to miss her growing up. She is really funny and I love her a lot. When I'm at home she follows me everywhere. As for my parents I miss them too, buts its kind of relaxing to not live with them. More stress when you live at home because you have to live to impress. ""  I love my parents and all, but I like living on my one; well kind of, still have a roommate. When I go back home I get preferred treatment. This is because my parents miss me a lot. I'm actually not that home struck, I don't find it too difficult to live afar. I think this is partially because I know that if anything arises they are about a two or three hour drive away. I do feel sad that I'm not spending time with my family though. In this sense I feel inhumane, because I made the final choice of coming to Austin. Well it seems like half my time is over and I am starting to run out of mind speech. Ok, I'm just typing to type. Well, then that water bottle looks really good about now. I actually find college possible as long as I find time to study. That is the hard part because I spend most of my time walking from class to class, cleaning my room, doing laundry, taking a shower, eating, or just relaxing for a moment. There are so many little things that we have to do everyday that actually take a lot of our time. It's kind of aggravating but I guess that's just the way life is. I guess someday I'll get to rejoice in all that I have accomplished in the far future. I am scared of failure, but I deal with it. It's not the end of the world. I like this concepts but try not to remind myself of it or else I will use it as an excuse to not do something. I think Psychology is going to be my hardest exam because those old tests are really specific. I was like wow, I remember reading about that but don't exactly remember the detail to answer the question. That is another thing I am afraid of. Not being capable to learn all the stuff I need too. I know that if I gave myself enough time, like years I could definitely remember the details. But in the allotted time I have to learn all this information, along with other classes, just thinking about it makes my head hurt. I can't picture myself learning every single thing the book has. Especially when I have 5 books, and I have to learn almost all the information in all the books. Yeah, well I got my head hurting again. One good side is that this typing thing is almost over and I can continue studying. Although this might seem like a summarization of my daily life, this is what actually goes on in my head all the time. Especially the headache part. I think one of my major weaknesses is my English. Basically I learned English from tv because no one at my house spoke it. I guess my first language was Spanish, until I began watching tv and understood it. I hate having weak English skills though because I always below average. I guess its the one thing I'll never be good at.",0
"As I'm sitting here at my computer I'm thinking about how bad I started off this semester. I know that I should have handled my financial aid situation a lot earlier. Plus not to mention a class of mine got cancelled which threw off my whole my whole schedule. Causing not only a first week of overcrowded bookstores and no parking, but also one of unnecessary involvement in the mass confusion of adding and dropping courses. I'm also thinking how tired I am from staying up all night studying. In the back of my mind I'm hoping to get this work study job so that I can be independent and have money but something keeps telling me it may be too much for me to work and try to stay focused on school, considering how I took 12 hours and worked this summer. I keep smelling my cologne (CK1) that I accidentally poured on my clothes this mourning. A lot more came out then I expected and it has a distinct and very strong smell that overlaps anything else. Had I not been so tired maybe I would have realized that I only needed a couple of drops. Not to mention everywhere I have went today people either say, someone put on to much cologne, or , you smell good. I 'm looking at this clock above the page trying to pace my thoughts and time. I'm also looking at the clock in my room trying to set a schedule for my self that will allow me to do all assignments and class work in a good timely manner. My brain feels cluttered with many thoughts of how much work I need to do. I'm homesick already. I miss my family and I have only been here a couple of weeks. I didn't expect this my sophomore year. I thought it only happened to freshmen. I feel really hungry too. I haven't ate all day unless you call a frappachino from starbucks as a energizer a meal. I feel pain in my knee from over playing yesterday at Gregory. I'm hoping to get a chance to play on the the basketball team. But with my luck they won't have tryouts for the second year in a row. I wonder how all my high school buddies are doing in there schools and colleges. I wonder if they found the transition from high school to college as hard as I did. Probably not because they all play sports. I think if you play sports it makes you work harder because you know if you don't you won't play. I think a lot of people have a misconception of college athletes. they think they have it easy and that they get free grades. They don't. They have a job. there coaches expect them to be robots that never get tired. While fighting through the daily soreness and injuries, they have to try to get school work done. I think that is tough. I have sympathy for them. I hope that I can get everything done today that needs to be done and also I plan on changing my shirt before this CK1 gives me a headache. I probably will never wear CK1 again. I hope all my friends and family are doing well. I plan to get some good sleep tonight also, of course after all my work is done. time is running out so bye.",0
"What do I write about? That is a good question, but I guess I should write about writing, or think about thinking. The thoughts streaming through my head right now mainly consist of how fatigued I am at the moment. I have been running around all day doing errands for the actives, and I just want to sit and do nothing. I guess this is almost doing nothing except for the movement of my hands and the flow of my thoughts. Part of my relaxation method at the moment is coming through my ears in the form of some music. Jimmy Buffet is streaming through my computer waves and out into my room. I wish I were sleeping and I wish I did not have to report to the house in about 40 minutes because I just want to do nothing right now. I don't feel that physically tired but more mentally fatigued. I did not have much class today, so I got to sleep in, but I could still use some rest. Perhaps I need to get outside and exercise to increase my energy in the future. I just don't have much open time with pledgeship at the moment for anything but class. I have been in school here for about two weeks, and I think it is really quite a cool set up. You don't have to go to class if you don't want to, but it certainly crushes your grades with low attendence. Sometimes the lectures are really quite boring, but this is never the case in Psychology, only my other classes. The biggest adjustment I think from High school to college is the format of testing with only a few test grades determining your whole grade. One of my annoying friends just walked in the room and is tearing up my room by bouncing a basketball. That guy is such a mess and I was not serious about the annoying part because he is cool, but now he exited the room to go find something exciting to do as opposed to watching some guy sit in his room and type on his computer. Let's see here, it has been 11 minutes of streaming thoughts and this is pretty fun. It is even more fun that this is not graded on content since surely my dull writing is sure to bore any living human. I am trying to search for thoughts, but I just realized that defeats the purpose of the exercise because there should be no interruption, just natural thoughts. All of the jimmy buffet music is taking me away to the beach and ""margaritaville. ""  I wish I were on the beach right now instead of at school, but its not all that bad. We have our own semi- beach environment with the river and other stuff around Austin. But now my hands are kind of aching because I don't think I have ever typed this long without taking a break. I am certain that I wil have great stamina in my hands when I am through with all of the writing assignments, and if it does nothing else, atleast my typing speed should increase significantly. It is pretty quite around here as opposed to like last night or other days  because usually a lot of people are hanging out in our room or playing loud music. I like this serenity with just me, my computer, and jimmy. I look up at the clock and see I am at the eighteen minute mark, and only two more minutes. I feel like this is some type of race, like a time trial or a running race in which I have 20 minutes to run as far as possible and must finish strong. This writing is not so painful as I though because I was sure that I would just go braindead and have nothing to say. I do have a lot to say but it might not be the most earth shattering writing. Looks like I am  out of time.",0
" On the one hand, supporters of these exams argue that they provide a standardized and objective way to evaluate a student's academic abilities. These exams cover a range of subjects and skills, including math, reading, and writing, that are essential for success in college. Furthermore, colleges and universities often use these exams as a factor in their admissions decisions, alongside other factors such as GPA and extracurricular activities.  On the other hand, critics of these exams argue that they are not an accurate measure of a student's potential for success in college. Some argue that the exams are culturally biased, and that students from certain socioeconomic backgrounds may not have had the same educational opportunities as those who can afford expensive test preparation courses. Furthermore, some critics argue that these exams do not take into account a student's unique talents and abilities that may not be reflected in a standardized test.  There are also arguments that the SAT and ACT are not always the best predictors of academic success in college. Some studies have shown that a student's high school GPA may be a more accurate predictor of college success than their SAT or ACT scores.  In summary, there are valid arguments on both sides of the debate about the accuracy of the SAT and ACT as measures of a student's aptitude for college. Ultimately, the decision to use these exams as part of the college admissions process is up to each individual college or university.     ",1
" One thing I have noticed is that change can be difficult, but it can also be transformative. It's common for people to get stuck in routines, habits, and ways of thinking that don't serve them well, but making a change, even a small one, can lead to improved well-being and better outcomes.  There are many changes people can make to improve their lives and the lives of those around them. One example is taking steps to improve physical health. Regular exercise and a balanced diet can help prevent chronic diseases and improve mental health. Quitting smoking or reducing alcohol consumption can also have significant health benefits.  Another change that can improve one's life is to cultivate positive relationships with friends, family, and colleagues. This can involve reaching out to people, having meaningful conversations, and showing genuine interest in their lives. Simple gestures like a smile, a kind word, or a thoughtful gesture can go a long way in creating positive interactions with others.  Another way to make a change for the better is by volunteering or engaging in charitable work. This can give a sense of purpose and fulfillment, while also making a positive impact on society. There are many causes to get involved in, such as helping the homeless, supporting education, or promoting environmental sustainability.  Finally, making a change in one's mindset can have a profound effect on life. Learning to practice gratitude, mindfulness, and positive self-talk can lead to increased happiness, resilience, and well-being. Practicing these techniques can help people manage stress and anxiety, and improve their overall mental health.  It's important to remember that change doesn't have to be dramatic or all-encompassing. Small changes can still make a big difference in one's life and the lives of others. It's also important to be patient and persistent when making changes. It's normal to encounter setbacks and obstacles, but with perseverance, change can become a habit and part of a daily routine.  In conclusion, making a change for the better can improve one's life and the lives of others. Whether it's improving physical health, cultivating positive relationships, volunteering, or adopting a more positive mindset, any step towards improvement is worth taking. Change may not be easy, but it can be transformative and lead to a happier, healthier, and more fulfilling life. ",1

" Communication is the process of exchanging information, ideas, feelings, and emotions between people. Communication can take many forms, such as verbal, written, visual, non-verbal, and digital. Communication is essential for human interaction, socialization, learning, and development.  In the last 20 years, communication has changed dramatically due to the advancement of technology. Technology has enabled new forms of communication that were not possible before, such as instant messaging, video calls, social media, blogs, podcasts, and online forums. Technology has also improved the speed, accessibility, affordability, and quality of communication across different platforms and devices.  Some of the factors that have caused the biggest changes in communication are:  The Internet: The Internet is a global network of interconnected computers that allows users to access and share information online. The Internet has revolutionized communication by providing near-instant and unlimited access to information and people around the world. The Internet has also enabled new forms of communication, such as email, instant messaging, voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), video conferencing, discussion forums, blogs, social networking, and online gaming. The Internet has also facilitated the creation and dissemination of user-generated content, such as videos, photos, podcasts, and blogs. The Internet has also increased the diversity and interactivity of communication by allowing users to communicate with different audiences and perspectives.  Mobile phones: Mobile phones are portable devices that allow users to make and receive phone calls and access other services, such as text messaging, multimedia messaging, Internet browsing, email, social media, and applications. Mobile phones have changed communication by making it more convenient, personal, and ubiquitous. Mobile phones have also enabled new forms of communication, such as texting, emojis, stickers, voice notes, video calls, and group chats.

" There are arguments both in favor and against raising school standards, but here are a few reasons why higher school standards may be beneficial:  Increased preparedness for college or the workforce: High school is meant to prepare students for the next stage of their lives, whether that be college or the workforce. Higher standards could ensure that students are more prepared for these challenges.  Improved critical thinking skills: Raising standards could encourage students to think more critically about what they are learning. This can be a valuable skill for students as they go on to college or the workforce.  Greater competitiveness: Higher standards could help American students compete with students from other countries. Many other countries already have higher academic standards in place, which can make it more difficult for American students to compete with them.  Better overall education: Higher standards could lead to a better overall education for students. This could help students develop a more well-rounded understanding of the world around them.  Of course, there are also arguments against raising school standards. Some people believe that higher standards could be too difficult for some students, which could lead to a higher dropout rate. Additionally, some people believe that higher standards could put too much pressure on students, which could negatively impact their mental health.  Ultimately, it's up to policymakers, educators, and society as a whole to decide whether or not to raise school standards. It's important to consider both the potential benefits and drawbacks before making any decisions.              ",1
"Ok so here I am sitting here writing what I am thinking. crap forgot to look at the clock. ook 4:43. kinda took me a while. analog clocks. hey what did the digital clock say to the analog clock?  look ma, no hands!  yea that is pretty lame but it just popped into my mind. hah I almost wrote pooped into my mind. that would been shitty. does anyone care if I write curse words?  because I think in curse words all the time. dammit my eye itches. alrighty that is a little better ok I'm still just writing not really thinking about what I'm writing or at least trying not too because I keep making all kinds of spelling errors. I can type fairly fast but when I do its fairly shitty. I keep making mistakes and having to go back and erase my mistakes so it kinda takes away from my train of thought. or stream of consciousness (sp?) as u call it. I'm not really a psychologist type person. I'm only taking this class because it sounded like the least boring of the 30 or so choices I had. plus I could tell my friends why they are so stupid. or, well, that was my original plan. I don't know now, but it still seems fairly interesting. I'm not trying to kiss ass there like I sometimes do, and am fairly good at by the way, I really think its interesting, for them most part. like the lie detector test. I found out how to beat on of those things. just lie a lot, then tell the truth occasionally and switch it up enough that it confuses the shit outta the machine. and also make sure that the investigator person does not know whether your lying or telling the truth, you know kinda play stupid. lie when you don't need to. tell the truth but make it sound like a lie. convince yourself its a lie even though you know its the truth. heh my foot itches. reminds me of that time in class you were talking about this assignment. whenever you mention this stream of consciousness writing my foot always itches because you had that stupid itch comment. it was not really stupid just annoying and it bugs me and it was annoying. and it still is. hey my typing has gotten somewhat better of the the last few minutes probably because I'm not concentration so much of fixing my mistakes. so you'll just have to live with all my shitty typos so there ha!  yoo can't stop me because you just said write what on your mind and what if there are a lot of rtypes in my mind?  hihn?  huh?  what u going to do about that?  this charis too low. there we go that is better but now it won't rock. htere fixed that too ok now this is linda wierd because my legds are pusing against the bottom of the desk which sucks because/ I can't lean bakc as much. and my wrists are stargting to get tired because they have nothing to lean on. I have no where for mu wrists theya re ruined! damn my desk for now havign a wrist rest. ok this chari is too high now. and mt arpmits are sweating and I have no idea why. thta happens a lot and I hate it. it makes me look like a nervous fool evcen if I am. ok chair lowered back to where it origicnlly was ok now I'm not even looking at the words I type I'm just staring at my fingers as they type the words and not relallyt thinking about what I'm typeing that sit be interesting to see wat kinda crasyt shit comes of out omy  head I know what kind of mistakes I'm makeing but I'm trying tnot tot chrorect thim and now I'm tryinf nor ro ecen hink just let my ifngers flow and let them do the talkjing not me oand now my eytes are closed that is not workingbla bla bla bla bla I'm still writing now how do u like that?  ur not even going to read therse are you?  I just know it your just doing this for some reason that no one knows yeet but it will be so obvious after u explain it that everyone or at least me will fdeel stupid. u know kinda like that lie detector tesxzt. if u had explained it before then it wouldnt have worked. if I knew how a lie detector test worked then it wouldnt really be that hard to beat. and since u said that they're so accurate, that is making us think that they work all the time so then if we ever get convicted of a crime, or at least on trieal then we'll think that the lie detector works and we won't be able to fool it but then you told ous how it worked and so now we know that is it is not har as accurate as u originally tol us that it would be ok maybe I should just randomyl type letters and see what comes out I'm fsitting here typeing words onto my computer screen and I really doint beel like isttint here typing words I really want to be sleeping of playing counterstaiek or fucking my girldfirend. ytes that last one idont know wny trs last but that sounds really good right now, don't u think. /  but you have a wife I'm sure that uve been doing for a long time so it kinda lost its spart me and meagan have been together 2 years and have been fucking for one yea she thot that she would wait till he was married but yea that is just jddidnt turn out and its not like I forced her we just did it one day without really thinking about it and it was good and I'm getting a little hard now just thinking aobut it myabe I shouldnt be tell ing u this shit but hey u asked its ur own fault if u don't like what I'm witing mmm yea that sex sessions sounds really gfood right now I wish she was here. shed kinda bubm tho so she is goin to acc but hopefully she will be smart enough to transger to a good skoo like ut next year and we can get an appartment together and fuck all the fuck we want. that wousld be fun I would like that. come home after a long day of school to come in my woman  yea, tat would be nice. are you still following me?  hey my roommate just walked in es in his air force unouiform hold on I'm going to explain to him what I'm doing ok no I'm not he didn't ask so he problably does not carel;  ill assume he does not care. aww I stopped thinking about meagan and my erection went away now I see what u mean about how himans can just think about a ember of the opposite sex ad get ariysed but then they can be in the same room as them an not be. let me tell u that does not happen that often. the second one that is. us being together and me not wanting to jumop on her. unless we;kre fighting or my friends are around. either of those. ok my roommate is talking on the phone and its kinda distracting me ookk he is done now well I think its beed 20 minutes I just looked at my watch and yteal I think tis 20 minutes, 5:03  ok cya in class oink",0
"My roommate just asked me if I have any homework due tomorrow and I don't but yet I still feel as if I need to be reading or studying gor something. I'm afraid I'm doing what I sould be doing, what everybody else is doing, studying. I feel as if my classes aren't hard. I also feel as if everyone knows what they want to do in life and I have no clue. I feel so ashamed that I don't know. Before I came to college, I knew what I wanted to be and do so I was going to come here and work for that goal. I would rather do nothing else but be a teacher. I want to teach so much but there is absolutely no money in it. And thats terrible because teachers can be so influencial. I have had several teachers that have been awesome and make me want to teach even more. I want to help and to influence and to have that feeling that I was a part in that student's recieving and A on a test or a paper. I would want to teach either a math class or biology for highschool students. I was always tutoring and helping my friends or anyone that needed help and I enjoyed it so much. I graduated in a whole year early to get out of highschool. Don't get me wrong, I had a great time in highschool but it was time for me to leave. It was time to start my life. I am in a hurry to grow up, I'm tired of being young. I feel as if I've been the youngest in everything. I was the youngest one at all my family reunions, I was the youngest model. Yeah, I model. It goes on like that for a lot of things. And now I'm the youngest in college, its seems anyway. I graduated early for lots of reasons. Everyone asks me what made me decide to do it and I never really go in to it because I din't like to tell people my sob stories unless I trust them or they know my background. But since I have to write for 20 minutes, I'll tell you. It all got started when my parents got divorced when I was in 8th grade. I really feel as if I had the perfect life if thats even possible. Both my parents got remarried to other people within a year of their divorce. I went through a really hard time then, and I know its completely cliche but I would love it if they got back together. I think they're perfect together. The woman my dad married was a complete idiot. I mean, its sad being 10 times smarter than someone twice your age. But now they're divorced, my dad just wasn't happy with her. I'm happy she's out of the picture. The man my mom married is a big reason I graduated early. I loathe and despise him with a burning passion. I know its immature and selfish, but I will go out of my way to be a bitch to him. I think he's a horrible, miserable man and is completely wrong for my mom. A lot of people say, no youjust don't like him because he's not your dad, blah blah blah. But then they meet him and understand exactly what I mean. I think my mom was a little selfish when I she decided to bring this man into our lives knowing no one liked him. I have this wierd ability to pick out people I know are not good people. My parents had this friend who I hated since I was a little girl, the first day I met him. Later, when I grew up i find out he was a big cocain addict and was always calling my parents to pick him from jail or get him out of whatever mess he got himeself into. I never liked him. I get the same feeling with my step father. I don't even like calling him. I usually refer to him as my mom's husband. I feel so bad about leaving my little brother. He's 9 years old. I hate to leave him with at home with no one to defend him against my step dad. I always stood up for him shen Bert, thats my stepdad's name, would be rediculously rude for no reason. There's sometimes when my mom would step in and say something. My real dad is there, always around doing things with us, don't get me wrong. I have the greatest dad. I feel sorry because my dad is not onw for being alone and I think he's very lonely right now. Especially not that I'm gone, thats one less child for him to be with. I have an older brother too who goes to school at Vasser in New York. He's kind of lonely there right now and he's thinking about coming home and going to school in Texas. I love texas, I wouldn't want to live anywhere else.",0

"It is 12:53 on Tuesday and my roommate and I just finished eating lunch and  came down to the computer lab to work on our assignment. My computer in our  room is not hooked up to the Internet yet, so for the time being I have to come  down here. That's ok. The guy just came over because we forgot to give him our  IDs. Oops. Oh well. Anyway, I'm really sad lately. I miss all my friends from high school. Everyone I've met so far has been really nice and everything; I just miss how close we all were last year. I could go anywhere, to any school function, and see people that I knew and would feel comfortable with. Here, it's not that there are so many people - it's just that there are so many  people that I don't know. Every face that I pass on campus is another stranger. Actually, I have seen a few people that I know from other places. Earlier today I saw Brittany. But it's just not the same as walking down the hall and knowing every single person. I was so comfortable there. I don't know. I should  probably be writing on the other assignment topic, since I'm going off about  high school and college and what have you, but I'm kind of just blabbering so  whatever. I am ready to be comfortable with lots of people again. I miss my comfort zone that I had at Anderson and I want it back!!   Hey!  I just looked at my watch and it has already been ten minutes. I guess I  can't really say that it's been ten minutes, because of that guy that came over. It's probably been more like seven minutes. I don't like this keyboard. It's kind of hard to type on. This assignment is actually harder than I thought it  would be. I mean, it's not hard, because I'm not really writing on anything in particular, but it is kind of hard to think continuously for twenty minutes. I think it's crazy that so many Anderson people are in my psychology class. It  also freaks me out that Alex is in our class. Since you don't know about Alex, just let me say that he is the most intimidating person in the world. I think  underneath that tough guy Russian thing he has going for him he's really  probably a very nice person, but I don't know how easy it is for me to look past  the fact that he actually chased someone with an axe on the last day of school our junior year at City Park. So I wouldn't fail Alex if I were you. He might come to your office with his axe (do you spell it ""axe"" or ""ax""?  I don't know) or his machete or any of his other assortment of weapons that he totes around with him. I would really like to get to know him though - I think he would be an interesting person to get under his skin and see what he's really like. Not to mention the fact that it would be cool to have him be your friend in case someone was giving you trouble. I think that time is probably almost up, but I would kind of like to keep  writing. I think I will. The temperature in this room is perfectly comfortable. I don't know where that thought came from. I am scared about having to write papers. What if my professors don't like the way I write?  I've always loved to write, but I like writing creatively. I'm pretty bad at comparing and  contrasting and all my research papers are boring. I mean I got good grades on  them, but later I'd go back and read them and be like ""Hey did I actually write this?  Yuck. ""  I think I'm probably being hard on myself. I wonder how many  times I have used the word probably in this assignment so far. I bet a lot. I hate when people don't know that a lot is two words and not one. I wonder what Angie's deal is. She used to be so nice, but ever since Dis and  I rushed she has been so rude. That's her problem, I know. And it kind of  always justifies the fact that I didn't like her that much. I always had to  act like I did, and she was nice enough, but just something about her has  always rubbed me the wrong way. That's what I told Brian. Brian -- what to do about Brian?  I wish I knew I wish I could have some answer. I hate  leading  him on the way I did the other night, but that just seemed unavoidable. I know he needs me  and that's what I love about him. When I'm around him I feel  special and needed and important. But I just don't know if that is enough.",0
"Twenty minutes seems like a long time. It amazes me how weird time is. Like when you're sitting in a plane waiting to get off and it seems like hours, but it's only minutes. I spend alot of time on planes. My dad is a pilot. I fly free. I don't know what I will do after college, because then I don't fly free anymore. I won't be able to go anywhere whenever. My roommate is in the shower. She has a sorority thing tonight. I'm not in a sorority. I'm glad, it's not the place for me. A guy died in my hometown last weekend. I t was strange, because my roommate had just commented on deaths happening in threes, and Mother Theresa and Princess Diana had just died. I didn't know the guy at all, but still, that could have been anyone. I think about that a lot. Death. Like what if someone died that I knew, but I had never told them what they mean to me. That's selfish, I know, but that's what we are, we're selfish. We as in humans. A friend of mine in my psych class knew the guy who died. I like country music, but most people don't. I just started liking it last year, because my boyfriend at the time got me hooked on it. My back hurts. I like to rub people's backs. I wish someone was here to rub mine. Tonight I'll be alone in the dorm. I like that sometimes everyone just gets on your nerves. My roommate and I knew each other in high school. We have gotten along amazingly well so far. Knock on wood. I have never been in a car accident, when I was driving. My brother messed up his knee in a car accident. I like this song. He had to have his ACL ligament redone. He can be such a baby. I think men have an amazingly low pain tolerance. I really think that they just aren't as well equipped for pain. That's just a personal opinion. I give lots of personal opinions. People tell me I'm opinionated. I don't like people who can't discuss their opinions and thoughts. It's important to be able to communicate. I'm a speech major. My undergrad advisor is great. I met him at orientation, and I love him. He tells you exactly what he thinks and that is so important. I don't like this song. It's one of those depressing love songs that is so typical of country. I wonder if I'll get married. I think I want to, but not kids. I do not want kids. That's another one of my opinions. How can we bring a child into this world?  So then people ask me if  I wish I hadn't been born. Two completely different concepts. Anyway, I'm gonna call my Aunt Holly. She is like a second mother to me. I live my mother. She really is my lifeline. That's a scary thought, like could I survive without her?  Of course, she raised my to be a survivor. I love basketball. My mom and I watch games together all the time. The Rockets are my favorite team. I also like Dennis Rodman. But I hat e the bulls. Rodman always says what he is thinking. Some people think he's a little tooo crazy, but I love it. H breaks the mold. That's commendable in my book. I miss my cousins. One of them is a big basketball fan. He and I always talk basketball. I'm almost done, twenty minutes did not take as long as I thought it would. I really like this song. I'm finished!!",0
"I am very stressed out right now for several different reasons. For starters, I was half way done typing this paper when my computer messed up and everything was erased. Also, I have fake nails which makes it very difficult to type. At this moment, I am trying to write this psychology paper yet all I can think about is everything else I have to do. I wish I had a pen and lots of post it notes with me at all times because I am always thinking of things that need to be done, yet I can never seem to remember them. I am constantly bombarded with thoughts of what books I need to go buy, what sections I need to read for what class, and how I am going to pass this semester living in Castilian. It is wild and very loud which makes it very difficult to study. Also, my ex-boyfriend Derek is in the hospital. He has Multiple Sclerosis and it happens to be very bad right now. I feel so guilty because I have not had the chance to visit him since he has been admitted into the hospital. I think that my mom and I are going to send him some flowers, though. We broke up almost two months ago and he has had a difficult time excepting that fact. It makes me sad to know that he is in the hospital doing absoultely nothing while I am away at college having the time of my life. I don't want him to think I don't care about him anymore or that I have forgotten about him, but this is my own way of really moving on. Last night we had our first date dash for my sorority. I invited this guy named Jordan who lives at Castilian. He is really good looking and we had a lot of fun together last night. Usually I am intimidated by good looking guys, but for some reason I find him very easy to talk to. We also had fun dancing together which is a definate plus because I often feel self-conscious when dancing with good-looking guys. I am a little upset becuse he left me after we got back to Castilian. He told me that he was going to go talk to his friends for a few minutes and that he would be right up. Too bad he came up an hour later when we had already left. I am not even that mad though because I know he feels very bad about it. I am hoping that he invites me to Delt pledge line. I am also very excited because this guy I met and dated at camp this summer wrote me an e-mail! It may sound pathetic but I was really glad to get it. He is a lot older than I am so I was expecting him to forget about me after camp. We are planning on getting married in four years as long as ""college doesn't change me. "" He is a TA at OU and is one of the most interesting guys I have ever met. We share a lot of the same beliefs and have such a good time together. When I graduate from college we are going to move to a beach in Mexico together. We just sarcastically talk about that, but I wouldn't mind it being a reality!! The other night I put some closure on an event that I had needed to for years. It felt really good to do that. And now I am going to put closure on this paper because all I can think about is what I need to do and how I need to be back up at school soon so I can start getting ready for the game.",0
"What a strange assignment. Why did the typing start indented? Twenty minutes seems like a long time and the timer does not make anything go any faster. It's weird that the one thing you look forward to all day turns out to suck. What do wounded ducks look like? Alright, 1% complete with this assignment. Physics is really hard, but I actually understand everything fairly well. I suppose that's a plus. I wish Lindsay would talk to me. I really miss her companionship. I suppose now is where you notice that I am a normal college kid going through the feelings and emotions. I really hate to be normal. I am not somebody who is outrageous to be not normal because that is conforming to another standard. I instead just do what works for me and disregard most everybody else. I really miss Lindsay. I wish I knew what to do to get he back. I think that is the problem, you can't get someone back, you can only hope they come back. I really hope the power doesn't go off in the middle of this assignment (knock on wood). It's been going out recently. Alright, almost 25% complete. Maybe I shouldn't track my progress. Is anybody really going to read this? Is this simply an experiment? Maybe it's a wpm counter like in computer class. Here comes the scary part in the music. I am listening to Firebird Suite. It really is a neat song, but it lacks something, not sure what but something. What if you started this assignment at 4:50 on Friday? That would really be horrible, but it wouldn't be quite as bad as starting it at 4:41. That would actually be ironically funny. Good times. Something is odd. Not sure what, but something seems a bit strange. I want some natural light, I really can't stand these fluorescent lights. These buildings also are disturbing. I didn't live in the country, but I really miss the trees I had around my house. Living amongst these lonely trees is strange. It's like they are put on display as something that used to be. I want to go to a school that is in the trees. I am talking a tree house. In the trees of the Amazon. That would be a sweet experience. The window, right. Haha, of course I open my window and see construction. Great, just great. It's rather depressing. Alright, more than 50% complete. This could really be a dangerous thing if you really tapped into your thoughts. Might find something you don't want to find. Hmm. I hat that feeling of being hungry after you've just ate. Is ate the right word there? I think it might be eaten"", who knows. I feel like I have something to do, but I really don't know what it is. It felt really good to sleep in this morning. I kind of felt lazy, but none-the-less, it felt great. I saw Cedric Benson in his Escalade XLT today. That is a very nice vehicle he has. Almost 75% completed. What a bunch of crazy rambling. It must suck to be the one to read all of these. I suppose you just search for keywords and check their frequentness. Is that a word? Who cares? I know you don't. I am running out of thoughts and my right pinky hurts, perhaps I should learn how to more properly type. I type pretty well I think, I just have this mysterious pain in my pinky. Shadows are the only two dimensional objects. Shadows are cast from three dimensional objects. So is it safe to say that three dimensional objects are shadows of 4 dimensional objects? Can we say that we are shadows of time? There's a predicament. What is time? That's also a predicament. That would be cool if somebody would call me right now. I really don't want to have to get up so early on Saturday (7:00). Oh well, can't do much about it I guess. I wonder how Phoebe is doing? That thought was brought on by a song that I just heard. Time is almost up. Check you on the flip side. Ciao.",0
Im sitting at the computer. I just got done working out. my arms and chest are sore. The pain is good though. I want to go out. I want to start playing golf again but it is too expensive golf is fun but I like to go out partying but its expensive my girlfriend is bothering me oh well I like it my friend is talking about a boat it makes it harder to write but it is ok because Im using his computer I want to play lacrosse but it is very rough I dont understand how they play but dont hurt themselves badly ya know well anyway I feel like running oh not really it is weird how my mind says stupid things that make no sense I think I will go to the steamboat and watch those two girls play again this will be their last time to ever play like it is a monumental breakup or something but hey what if one of them becomes good maybe I will be able to say yo man I saw them play live. noway  bro yea. cool They are pretty good I cant believe e I ever liked country music because it is all so fake I mean nobody writes there songs they dont do anything but sing and look pretty especially the women. if you are ugly it is nearly impossible to be a country singer. unless you are Leann Rimes then you can tell every one that you are 14 and thats ok because instead of the rednecks saying damn shes got a nice ass I guess they could say shes only 14 and that makes them happy. but if you think that ugly women is 14 you are sadly mistaken shes back ok well I sure miss my Jim Roam I liked that show but it is on the air in Austin oh well Austin is cool anyway even if there is no damn parking. I miss the old days of just driving around town and then thinking to myself  I go there and hey what do you know there is a parking spot or even a whole lot of parking spots. yea but then I would have to live in my boring ass town where there is nothing to do at all I mean take tonight for example Im going to watch a band play in pearland I would be sleeping but here Im going to start drinking a couple minutes in fact I will start drinking now oh no there is a man possessed by alcohol on the computer you must stop him he could easily kill some innocent family of 4 walking along and that would be very very unfortunate. ok whatever Im crazy no not really so I am just about done here according to the little clock in the bottom of the screen in the bottom of the screen cool Im going to party I quit bye,0
" Writing a good resume is important for anyone looking for a job or trying to advance their career. Here are some tips for crafting a strong resume:  Tailor your resume to the job: Customize your resume to the specific job you're applying for. Read the job description carefully and highlight the skills and experience that match what the employer is looking for.  Keep it concise: Your resume should be no longer than two pages. Be selective about what information you include, and use bullet points to break up dense paragraphs.  Use clear headings: Use headings to clearly label each section of your resume, such as ""Education"" or ""Experience.""  Use action verbs: Start each bullet point with a strong action verb, such as ""managed,"" ""created,"" or ""developed.""  Quantify your accomplishments: Use specific numbers and data to demonstrate your accomplishments, such as ""increased sales by 20%"" or ""managed a team of 10 employees.""  Highlight relevant experience: Focus on experience that is most relevant to the job you're applying for. If you're applying for a marketing job, for example, highlight your marketing experience before your customer service experience.  Check for errors: Proofread your resume carefully for spelling and grammar errors. Ask a friend or mentor to review it as well.  Include a summary statement: A brief summary statement at the top of your resume can help grab the employer's attention and highlight your most impressive qualifications.  Make it visually appealing: Use a clean, easy-to-read font and format your resume with plenty of white space. Use bold and italicized text sparingly to draw attention to key points.  By following these tips, you can create a strong, effective resume that will help you stand out from the crowd and get noticed by employers.       ",1

"Geez, I'm trying to think about what I'm supposed to write about for 20 minutes. This is weird. I wonder if people use this assignment as a Dear Diary"" thing. I wonder if the psych people are going to read every single one of these writing assignments. That would be a lot of reading to do. How can they read so much? I get so tired of reading all the time. I want to have fun. Instead of having fun though, I'm always stuck in my room reading all the time. I hate reading. School reading isn't fun. text book reading that is. I don't like reading textbooks on weird classes to read on like chemistry. Why do we need a next book for that class besides for doing homework problems. No one reads the text book crap. I don't even understand why some classes have certain books. Hm. I just don't like reading. I think this means that I'm going to have problems in college later on. Everyone always tells me that when you're in college, you have to have the patience to read everything. If what I read what actually interesting, I wouldn't have a problem. Hmm, well I remember in English in High School, a lot of the books that we read were really interesting. I liked Lord of the Flies and Anthem, and the Scarlett Letter. Those were really cool books. The bad thing about the readings was that we had to analyze EVERY SINGLE thing! I hated analyzing. I mean, analyzing is important, but not when you have to analyze stupid stuff. I remember on the Scarlett letter test we had to analyze why the grass was green. what the hell was that all about? I don't' get it! There are some things that don't really need explaining. They're just fact. How can you explain fact? Seriously, I think teachers just want to see how well we can think of things at the top of our head. I think they're trying to teach us something on that. How well you can come up with some explanation in a split second. Actually, I guess that can come in handy. Like for example it can help you with coming up with an excuse to your boss on why you were late. You wouldn't get a ""good grade"" if your reasoning wasn't valid enough. Hmm. I don't know. Some teachers are cool. I miss my teachers back at home. I miss Mr. Fred, he was such an awesome teacher. I somewhat liked calculus because of him. He had a weird personality. that's what made him cool. I also miss Mrs. Conrey. She was fun to talk to too. I miss our little group in Bio2. That was my favorite class! I loved hanging out with the gang. Geez, I can't believe that time is gone. life went by so fast. I wish I could go back and relive some moments. not to change them. but to feel that kind of happiness again. Now, everyone is so concerned with getting to know new people. I mean, I don't mind getting to know new people but not everyone likes the whole ""hi, my name's Rebekah, what's yours?"". I think certain people would get really annoyed by that. Geez, there are so many people in this school, it's not even funny. I miss knowing everyone you pass by. It's kinda like that Cheers song. ""Where everybody knows your name. dum da da dum. and they're always glad you came. dum da da dum. "" I love that show. Hehe, it's great. Geez, life passes by way too quickly. It's kinda funny to think about how that was the ""Seinfeld"" or ""Friends"" during that decade. Hehe, but it's still funny. It's funny how people don't like watching those old shows anymore. I don't care how old they are. if they're funny, they're funny. That's all that matters. It gets annoying how everyone puts up with the same Friends reruns. It's so annoying. but still a great show. I remember when a new season would start, everyone would say ""ohh, this is the last season!"". the last season is finally here. I mean the show is still really funny and all. but come on. everyone knows that it was getting really old. Everyone's hooking up with someone else. it's kinda annoying but kinda cute how that worked out. But I think it's wrong how Joey hooks up with Rachel. I'm sorry but Ross and Rachel belong to only each other. It's wrong to see them not together. I really hate how they're not married on the show. Dude, you shouldn't have a kid unless you're married. You're just asking for your kid to have problems if you're not. What the hell is this all about how girls have sex b/4 marriage. I think it's so stupid! What the hell happened to good morals and traditions? Now everyone's a whore. that's so disgusting. How can you share yourself with everyone you see? Grr, people annoy me.",0
"I just got back from math class, and surprisingly, I feel good despite my lack of sleep for the past 2 weeks. Or I should probably say my irregular sleep patterns. But anyway, I'm not looking forward to my economics class, but my psychology class is a different story. I like my professor, he actually keeps the class interesting, as well as entertaining/comical, unlike my economics class. I dread that class every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, and I would not be surprised if I fell asleep in that class today. But there is one advantage to going to economics Salina, or should I say Natalie. I got to stop calling her Salina. I wonder if she gets offended. I hope she knows that I mean well, and besides, she's so cool. Not to mention, fine as all hell. I wonder what I'm going to do tonight, I hope I see Amy. Woooooohh deeee! She is the most gorgeous, absolute prettiest, hottest girl I have ever seen in my entire life, hands down, bar none. And yes, I am keeping Annie in mind. Annie would be a close second. I wonder how Annie is doing, I miss her. I should probably respond to her email, considering she did email me 2 WEEKS AGO! That's alright, I can just come up with another excuse, like always. That could be the problem with me. I just put things off and blame it on laziness. But I don't want to go into that right now, because I would need 20 different 20 min writing sessions. That sucks that I was just interrupted by my roommate's phone, because I was about to be on fire. I wonder how many words per minute I've been typing. Pretty good, I'm sure. It's surprising that I haven't mentioned Jared, or Dom I don't give an F about those guys anymore, and I wouldn't be one bit discouraged if I never saw them again. You better believe that. I could have hit those bastards, for the sake of keeping this writing assignment somewhat clean. Anyways, I believe that it will catch up to them someday, and I'm going to let Nature take it's course. I know for a fact that Miles doesn't have anything going for him, I mean he got fired from my friend's dad's restaurant, and then got fired from Subway! Not to knock Subway, but I would expect more out of him, or maybe not. Dom will somehow make an important person feel special, he'll win his or her respect and make a living out of it, but he'll never earn respect from anyone. Jared, I hate to admit, is smart, for now. But oh yeah, it'll catch up. All those drugs are going to bake his head, I can already see it happening. Sure, he's textbook smart, but that won't last for long. Usually, I would wish for their wellbeing, but I have been through far too much. Right now, I seem malicious towards them, but in 2 weeks, I'm sure I just won't care. Has it been 20 minutes, because it feels like about 2 hours. I'm going to check the time, I know, I know, that's cheating, but I HAVE TO! Here I go. I'm back, I've got 4 minutes left. So, there's this kid I used to know from middle school, his name is Iraj. He's Iranian, and to my surprise, he's so cool. I'm sorry, that's sounds mean, but this is middle school feelings mixed with high school feelings. He's got PINK hair for crying out loud! And I think he's the only kid that I have ever met able to pull a stunt off like that. I think it suits him, and suits him well. I'm very impressed with how he matured, not to mention his full beard. He actually told me that I used to look more Iranian in middle school, which I think is just crazy. I would say it's the other way around. Basically, he's really cool, and I wish him well. I just hope that he outgrows the not caring much about academics. It's either he doesn't care, or the alarm just went off. Alarm? Oh yeah! I guess I didn't have to check half way through. I don't think I can stop typing, it's like I'm permanently in this stream of consciousness mode, and I really like it. It's like I can express, or spill all of my feelings out, without having to hear feedback. However, feedback would be so beneficial. I'm going to force myself to stop right now.",0
"it is 7:30 right now and I have to write for 20 minutes. my roommate is going to come in here and read this and make fun of me. she said she would be home at 7;30 I bet it will be a lot later. damn, I'm really bad at typing, iwish I did't have to look at the keyboard while I did this. I wonder who will be reading this thing. I would really like to read someone elses. I hope after this I can get back on that pretesting thing because it sure as hell wasn't working for me earlier. what if I can never get back on it. I'll probably fail this class. man, I just got a call from someone at atm. I could see it on the caller id. shit, that means I'm going to have to calle them back and pay for the long distance. I couldn't answer it and let it skrew up my thinking process. ireally wonder who is going to read this. I wonder how much more time I have. I don't want to look at the clock that will make it seem worse. I wonder what my parents are doing. I bet they're pretty bored. I really suck at typing maybe I should take keyboarding class or something, am I going to run out of room here? it looks like it, oh no ican keep going. I feel like doing something fun. I wish bryce would stop calling so damn much. watch him get on line and be able to read this. iwonder if thatsa possible. I bet you have to know my social security number or some thing. but the university knows it. I wonder if the computer is like timing me or something. my mom would be really proud of me for doing this she doesn't think I know what I'm doing when it come to computers. my roommated will also be impressed when she come home from whereever she is. I bet this would be a lot harder to do in that class room with 400 people. iwould probably start writing about the people around us. by the time I finish a sentence I've already thought about 10,000 other things. I wonder if other peoples are going to be like this. they are probably going to talk about something worthwhile. I used to think it was worthwild. I hear voices outside my window I wonder if they can see me. they're probably saying that girl looks at th e keyboard when she type instead of the screen. wow time is going by really fast, I only have like 4 more minutes. I wonder what will be done with this and if I will ever see it again. where the hell is lindsay? I think I'm starting to get a crick in my neck. I have 2 more minutes. computers are pretty fun I wish I didn't have such early classes. I keep thinking some one is going to knock on my door. geez my suitemate is really weird. I wonder what she does. damn almost all my thoughts from 20 minutes recorded. that is pretty cool. shoul;d I read over it?",0
" Thomas Mann's assertion that war is a cowardly escape from the problems of peace suggests that nations and leaders may choose to resort to war as a way of avoiding difficult political or economic challenges. This statement reflects a pacifist perspective that regards war as a destructive force that causes immense human suffering and destruction.  While it is true that wars often arise out of political and economic difficulties, it would be too simplistic to assert that war is always a cowardly escape. In some instances, war may be an inevitable response to threats to national security or to protect the basic human rights of a group of people. For example, the Allies fought in World War II to defend against the aggression of Nazi Germany and to stop the atrocities committed against Jews and other minorities.  However, it is also true that many wars have been fought for reasons that were not necessarily justifiable. For example, the Vietnam War was fought primarily to contain the spread of communism, but it caused immense suffering for the Vietnamese people and resulted in many American casualties. Similarly, the Iraq War was waged under the false pretext of weapons of mass destruction and resulted in the deaths of thousands of Iraqis and Americans.  In conclusion, while war may be a necessary response in some instances, it is often a destructive and avoidable tragedy. The decision to go to war should be made only after careful consideration of all other options and with a clear understanding of the costs and consequences. Ultimately, peace should be the goal of all nations, and efforts should be made to resolve conflicts through diplomacy and peaceful means whenever possible.    ",1
" Some argue that requiring students to recite the Pledge of Allegiance is a patriotic tradition that instills a sense of national pride and unity. It is seen as a way to promote respect for the country and its values. Those who support the mandatory recitation of the pledge also argue that it is a way to honor the sacrifices of the men and women who have fought for the country's freedoms.  On the other hand, opponents of the mandatory recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance argue that it violates the First Amendment's guarantee of freedom of speech. They believe that forcing students to say the pledge goes against the principles of democracy, which allows individuals to express their opinions and beliefs freely. Moreover, some people argue that reciting the pledge in schools is a form of nationalism that is exclusionary to non-American students or students who do not share the same values as those expressed in the pledge.  Ultimately, whether the Pledge of Allegiance should be mandatory or voluntary depends on one's interpretation of patriotism and freedom of speech. Some people may see mandatory recitation as a way to instill values of loyalty and respect for the country, while others may view it as a form of forced patriotism that goes against the principles of democracy. Whatever the case may be, it is important to ensure that students' constitutional rights are respected, and that they have the freedom to express themselves in a way that aligns with their beliefs and values.

"I really don't know which house I liked best. The first one was alright but I don't know if I would like living in a duplex. What if they are annoying or out of control? I liked the second house a lot more. It was huge and nicely kept but it was a little pricey. We would definately need at least like 7-8 people to live with us to bring down the price. It'd be cool if Emily and Singer would live with us but I don't know if their parents would like the idea of them living with guys. It would definately hook us up for meeting girls and what not. Better parties for sure. I'm so tired, getting up early for that stupid ticket drawing that got sold out really sucked. And now we don't even have tickets so we woke up early for nothing. I have so much reading to do in all my classes but I know i'll be fine. I need to call kathy back too. I wish she could have stayed up here longer but that's not possible so there's no reason to dwell on it. I wish i had more time to take a nap before our next meeting with the other realtor. But i am pretty excited to see some more houses. Supposedly there's a nice one across from the frat which would be ideal. We need one close to campus too because i don't know if i can afford a car next year. I'm going to have to find myself a big paying job this summer. Damn my head is killing me. I really should try to take a nap. I'm really pissed about my phone. I don't understand how a top of the line phone can lose its battery in 10 minutes of use when it's supposed to have 4. 5 hrs worth of talk time. If this new battery doesnt work im going to lose it. I don't have the patience to be dealing with this crap. I need to take a shower before i leave tonite because there won't be any time before the party i don't think. Why does my room not get any cooler. I'm sweating and im just sitting here typing. I have a horrible taste in my mouth, i should go brush my teeth or rinse my mouth with listerine. How have only 9. 5 minutes passed. I'm starting to get a little tired here. I really didnt like that first realtor. He kept rushing us and stuff and he just seemed annoying. But if he has the house we want i won't deny him the business. My blisters finally healed so wearing those boots won't kill me anymore. My cold is starting to go away too which is good. I hope Emily is taking good notes in chem because i just couldnt make it today. Way too tired. Whatever i'll give her a call when class is over and see how things went. It's not a bad class its just really basic and easy stuff right now that i remember from high school. Plus it is a pretty long walk. Ok 8 minutes to go, not too bad. I'm pretty hungry now that i think about it. I would love some spicy wings from pluckers. But i have to cut down on expenses so there goes that thought. Casey was hilarious today when we were trying to get donations for charity. I couldnt stop laughing. That was fun. I need to get my plane ticket for winter break. They are so damn expensive even though it's so far away. I should do that today or tomorrow so that they don't get any worse. OK 5 more minutes it's almost over. My fingers are starting to cramp up a bit. And my hunger keeps growing so i hope these minutes go by fast. I hope everyone still takes the bus to dallas for the game because at leat that will be fun. Rima said we may be able to stay in her when we go so that would be a sweet deal too. Craig just got out of the shower. I need to take one too. I need to do some laundry as well soon becaus my basket is starting to fill up. I got to find someone to do it with so its not so boring. OK im too hungry i need something to eat now. Twenty minutes is definately longer than i thought but i guess it is almost over. About 1 minute to go. . nice. Josh got some really cool things to hang in our room today. Definately gives the room some more character. 30 seconds left. 20 seconds left. 10 seconds. 5. 4. 3. 2. 1 bye",0
"I work at a daycare in the mornings on Teusday and Thursday before class and friday after class. During the day I am in my classes and at night I have meetings or readings to do. I am sytressing out right now, and I am trying to not think about how much I need to do. Each time I finish with one task I feel a little better but after a few minutes I get stressed out again. I can not wait for the labor day weekend though, because I am going to spend some of time catching up with all of my readings and some of my time just relaxing. I think after Labor day I will be relaxed and I will not be so stressed out with all of my work. I like my job in the mornings on Teusday and Thursday, I work at a daycare for infants. I work with the two months to two years, from eight in the morning until twelve-thirty in the afternoon. I like working with that age of children, because they are so trusting. They are away from their parents, but they still are so relaxed and trusting with all of the teachers at the daycare. I feel dumb writting this, because I have so much going through my mind but I can't write it all down, because most of it is the same thing over and over. Wondering how I am going to finish all of my homework and go to work and go to my meetings. I geuss for the most part I am just stressing out because it is the begining of the semester, and my goal for this  semester is to make at least a 3. 75. I feel that if I get behind at the begining of the semester, I will never be able to catch up, and I will not reach my GPA goal. I am a very opptimistic person though, so I know that if I keep up with my work I will be able to reach my goal, and maybe even get higher. Another thing though is that I should be a junior in years, but I am nine hours short, so over next semester and the summer I have to catch up, so that I can graduate on time. I am not worried about that, I am more concerned with my grades, because I know that I can catch up in summer, and next semester. I feel a little bit better no that I have almost completed this assignment, so that is a little off my head that I do not have to worry about. Now all I have to do is read 300 pages for three more of my classes, and do the pretesting, although it won't let me on right now. maybe when I am done with this assignment I can get connected to the pretesting, but if not I will have to wait for tomorrow to do that, because right now I have to go buy some more books. Then I have to go eat, because I have not eaten all day and after I eat, I have to go read about Russian ecconomics. After that it will be time for class and then I have the pre-law fraternity meeting tonight. After the metting I am going to go home and go to sleep right away, because I have been up since six in the morning and I am tierd now, and I still have laods to do. So I am done with this for now, I have to get started on the rest of my schedule.",0
"Well, I really don't know what to talk about now. I can't really think of what I am feeling. I guess relaxed and at the same time stressed. I have so much chaos in my life now that I can't even think straight. I just moved to a new city and a new home. I joined a soroity where I am suppose to meake all new friends in 1 week or less. I have a boyfriend that is non-exsistent in my life now. I have school work that I don't even know how to work on. I am just a mess. I am going home next weekend so maybe that will calm my nerves. I was very much overwhelmed when I came here about 3 weeks ago. I wasn't ready at all for this new experience in my life. I was but I wasn't at the same time. I was so ready to leave my parents but not to be on my own all the time. I sometimes feel depressed that I have no life but in actuality I really have it the best. I am waiting for my ""boyfriend"" to come and see me tomorrow. I have been waiting for 2 weeks. Don't know how long it will last. There are a lot of guys here that are also interested. I don't know. One minute I feel upset and just want to cry and roll up and the next I just want to go out and have so much fun. I miss my parents and brother so much. My dogs are also important to me and I dearly miss them. In high school I never use to study and now I am forced to or I will fail. Which the tachers don't give a crap about if anyone fails or not. In high school they did. I have so much to get use to and I am scared to tell the truth. I don't know why this is a question because no one will read this so I won't get into a lot. I am having fun though. I have met some really cool people and I know we will be friends for a long time. My soroity has also been a big aspect in my life right now. AEPhi is the name of it. I feel comfortable there and I know I will enjoy it immensley. Well, I don't know what else to talk about. I hope everything will turn out for the better and I can realx and actually enjoy myself and everyone else.",0
"It is weird to be here because usually people are here and I could visit them but no one is at home. My brother is now doing all the stuff I did last year and it's kind of a weird role reversal. I am also frustrated because I am here and if it was normal circumstances Jared would be here but of course his family decided to take a vacation and they are out of town. and it's so weird and frustrating to be here and not be able to just call him and see him, I guess it is part of the annoying ""sensitivity"" that girls seem to employ. I need to get out of that habit. But, in an hour and a half or so, I will be driving back to UT and bringing my roommate's and also my friends from here. The whole situation did not work out exactly how we planned because I was going to stay here this whole weekend but then Jill's ride got all messed up so if I don't bring her up today I have Chris and Emily who will be very disappointed and I would feel guilty if I just stayed here instead. but actually I kind of just do want to stay here at home for awhile and actually get some stuff done and just relax but I also am torn the other way too. Whatever, my mind is so strange sometimes. and also I am feeling stupid writing all these thoughts down. Am I going to be diagnosed with some kind of disorder by what I've written? rhetorical question. computers can be very frustrating. It is really getting on my nerves that I am not allowed to complete my pretesting requirement on here. at first I couldn't even access the screen to type in my social security number and then when I could do that it won't accept my password or user name. That is all very frustrating and I've tried all these different computers trying to access it. Oh well. Hopefully, I will finally figure it out. As I just skimmed over what I've written thus far, I am worried. The blurb above says there is no right or wrong thing to say but I have before, just done completely the opposite of what was intended on an assignment and I had to redo it so this makes me slightly nervous as to if the content of this is adequate or not. It is very quiet in this area right now and my thoughts seem so loud in comparison since they are all that I can ""hear"" and it all the activity that is going on. This assignment is actually kind of ironic because usually, I do write down everything that is in my head, like my thoughts and my feelings, and it helps me sort things out. It usually angers my friends because then they never know what upset me before because I wouldn't say anything because I'd have to go write it down to figure it out. Yet, while I'm typing this, it seems so forced to have to write down my thoughts. I guess because the ""audience"" I am typing for is so unknown and I feel self conscious of what I write. I just thought about this calculus homework I've been trying to work on for the past hour or so. It is so aggravating to try and understand something and completely fail or only understand a little bit which does nothing for progress toward solving the problem. I guess that is something I miss. I miss my smaller classes where there was always a lot of discussion and interaction. I guess in a way I'm being selfish but I can't help feeling that way. Oh well, I guess I am still in transition but I'm used to everything I just am not sure how much I like everything. well, I guess that is all my thoughts for now. I am so random sometimes. My train of thought that leads me to some comment or question is sometimes so mixed up and completely out of nowhere that I can't even believe how I think of some things. I'm not sure. But I bet a psychologist somewhere could figure that dilemma out. : )",0

"When I got online tonight I was prompted with an instant message from an unknown person. The person, aka MuffinCheeseqn, asked me if they remembered me from last night. Last night! Last night I was with Sarah, my roomie, watching Shrek! I was totally freaking out. I was telling Sarah that I had a stalker! This ""MuffinCheeseqn"" kept telling me that they were beginging to get to know me better so they wanted me to keep talking to them. Talk about freaky! Well finally a message box came up stating that it was one of my friends that had played a joke on me. What a friend! It ended up being my roomie's cousin! 'Lil punk! Anyhoo, that made my night though. I've been over at my friend Danny's dorm working on a computer science program that is due tomorrow. I've been there since 5! I don't like the first program and I'm majoring in CS! What was I thinking! They should have a major in learning the ABCs! Oh man its only been 5 minutes. Man, I think Sarah needs to be quiet so I can concentrate on this writing assignment! lol! So Sarah has some pretty cute guys in her classes! I've seen some although she has failed to introduce me to them! OO I just remembered that I need to finish the pre-screening for the experiment requirements cause I really don't want to write a five page paper! I'm not very good at writing papers. Obviously! I'm not very good at calculus either. Although, today I actually understood something in my calculus discussion class! I probably will have trouble applying it to my homework problems though. Oh my gosh. I have a calculus midterm on FRIDAY! well next Friday. I have to do some major studying this weekend. This weekend my parents will be out of town. It will be the last time my parents can take a vacation for a year. My mom just got a new job! Yeah for my mom! She's been really therefore leaving my mom was out of a job. So we were living off of my dad's salary which isn't enough to pay all the bills. Thankfully my parents savings saved up but still taking a little every month will eventually end in 0. My mom looked for a job for almost 3 months before she just got hired last week. She doesn't have a college degree so that made it hard for her to find a job. That's why she wants me to get an education. She doesn't want me to. Sarah needs to shut up! She just walked into my room. OH MY GOSH she's singing the Fresh Prince of Bel Air Song! lol She just read what I wrote. OH MY GOSH now she's playing her mello. She's in the longhorn band. She's a big band nerd. I was once a band nerd. I played the sax! Wow I have like two minutes left! Well right now I'm feeling. Hungry! Obviously my thoughts are everywhere! Good-bye!",0
" On one hand, requiring teachers to pass competency tests before they can teach can ensure that they have the necessary knowledge and skills to provide quality education to students. It can also help to raise the standards of teaching and improve the overall quality of education. This can have positive effects on student outcomes, including higher academic achievement and better preparation for future careers.  On the other hand, some may argue that requiring teachers to pass competency tests could be too restrictive, limiting the number of qualified teachers available to teach. Additionally, such tests may not be a reliable indicator of teaching ability or effectiveness. Some teachers who excel in the classroom may not perform well on tests, while others who perform well on tests may not necessarily be effective teachers. Moreover, such tests could disproportionately affect teachers from underprivileged backgrounds, who may not have had the same educational opportunities as others.  Therefore, it is important to strike a balance between ensuring that teachers have the necessary qualifications and skills to teach while also considering the potential drawbacks of requiring competency tests. Alternative methods for ensuring teacher quality could include ongoing professional development opportunities, teacher mentorship programs, and performance evaluations by school administrators and peers.

"As for now, I feel as if quite a weight of stress has been lifted off of my shoulders. I had many things to accomplish once I started school here at The university of Texas and I am finally beginning to lighten the stress little by little as I achive the goals I need to. for instance, today, I needed to petition credit of hours which I earned off of the ap testing which I took in highschool. I attempted to do it off of my compuiter but for some reason, even though I typed the correct web site, I could not actually claim my hours. Thus I actually went to the Measures and Evaluations building which allowed me to finally claim and petition my scores. also, the week before school started, I was ecxperiencing stress due to the fact that the ethernet card I purchased for my computer had a cd which was burned and incompetent of following the demanded preocedures. at that time, one evening I finally cried because of the accumulated stress which had built up immensly. thankfully, right now I am a  much happier person both on the enterier and teh exterior. for example, I began to write to all of my friends back home as well as write to my penpal who lives in Cicago Ilinois. I am starting to miss all of my friends and my family. the voices of my loved family do not leave my head. instead, their words repeatedly play in my mind as they are right now. I remember things my brother said to me whether it was great advice, or even a comment which brought me down. many times I feel that I can trust my brothers opinion since he tells me anything I need to know extremely bluntly and straight out. all my female friends I know may try to beat around the bush by telling me a point. I do the same thing. I care for my friends and try to tell them everything in a very nice way. however, when it comes to my biological brother,  he is probably the most honest boy who has ever spolken to me. who has ever spoken to me. I miss him a lot. actually I probably would not have been so homesick had my roommate not convinced me how much more comfortable and relaxed I would be at home. last weekend, she went home to visit her family and friends. when she came back, she told me that she was looking forward for the next weekend so she could go home and sleep in her own room once again. wow, how could I not imagine how nice it would be for me to go home as well and see all my old friends again. I really miss them. in addition, I miss my friends which go to different schools. I keep pictures of them to reminfd me of the friendship they shared with me. it is almost as if they are close in a way, but, not really. my mom on the other hand may just miss me quite a bit. I am looking forward to seeing her since she is in california visiting my precious grandmother right now. I'm very close to my mom and that is why I believe that my leaving may affect her and me. we are like best friends who tell each other anything in our lives. she cares for me and I hope that whatever I choose to do with my life I can impress her. however I would never do anything simply because of the reason that only she wants it of me. in fact she trusts me well enough to know that I will be able to grow up to be an independent person with great values, goals, and striving ambitions. my mother also helps in relieving my endless stress. just knowing that I can count on both my parents aids me in relaxing and doing the best that I can.",0
" In my analysis, the statement ""Friendship is the only cement that will hold the world together"" is an idealistic notion that lacks practicality in the real world. While friendship is a crucial factor in building trust and social cohesion, it cannot be the only force holding the world together.  There are many other factors, such as economic ties, political alliances, shared values, and cultural understanding, that are essential for maintaining global stability and peace. For instance, countries often form partnerships and trade agreements based on their mutual economic interests, which are driven by financial gains rather than friendships.  Furthermore, friendships can be transient and subject to change based on individual interests, circumstances, and personality traits. In contrast, the world requires more stable and long-lasting bonds to function smoothly.  Moreover, history has shown that even close friendships cannot always prevent conflicts or wars. For example, during World War II, the United States and the Soviet Union were allies, but after the war, their ideological differences led to the Cold War.  In conclusion, while friendship is an essential ingredient in building relationships, trust, and social cohesion, it cannot be the only force holding the world together. Other factors such as economic, political, and cultural ties are equally crucial. Therefore, the statement made by Woodrow Wilson is an idealistic notion that lacks practicality in the real world.     ",1
"I am waiting for Brad to get home. I hope that he's talking to Michael because they need to figure out what's happening before things get worse. I can't believe he's being so petty about this whole ordeal. Seriously, was he expecting us to pat him on the back and say how proud we are that he's started smoking pot. . not just a little either. . but massive amounts?  I don't quite understand how on earth he can simply think that just because he's been on medications and is immune and he's sick and is in pain that that is a valid excuse. We all have our issues to escape from, while i'll agree that yes none of us face exactly what he's going through with his disorders and his back, we have our problems too. I hate to see him like this, feeding himself bs to justify it. He knows it was wrong, i honestly think he knows its wrong and he claims he regrets it but deep down i don't think he does. This is his rebellion. What kills it the most is that it shows just how hypocritical he can be. Maybe a year ago he was bashing one of his really good friends for doing something so similar. . the guilt trips, the icq away messages, the finger pointing. Its all the same. I know thats what scares brad so much about it, because michael is his best friend, and he can't stand to see him turn into benny. Neither can i. I've known one too many people who end up permenately stoned so bad that they can't remember anything past the last fix. Its so sad to watch them as they stop being able to function. I know, just know that one of these days i'm going to get a call from someone saying that one by one they're dying off. Its so sad. Some of my best friends have become drug addicts and have nearly lost their lives because of it, and yet they continue to use it. Now they might as well be dead. . they have no personality and they'll never be the same people they once were. Drugs make you petty. They've all become petty. I worry how this effects brad. He's right, Michael basically is his only friend, guy friend anyway. If Michael were to hold this against him it would definately kill him and would seriously screw with his future. Brad has a hard time making friends. I'm actually incredibly surprised we're even together conisdering his track record. He's the shyest drama major I've ever met. He won't talk to people. I have to talk for him sometimes, and he gets upset if i don't introduce him. Most people know who he is, they just don't believe me. When i talk about him i talk about either why he's got me frustrated or how great he is, and when he meets my friends nothing. . he sits there and stares. He promises he'll try and its not something i hold against him. . yes it kind of annoys me but i seriously don't hold it against him. Marked up as one of his quirks. I have so many i guess i can't really hold his agianst him since he doesn't hold mine against me. I can't believe that Michael would hold a grudge. . he's always gotten so mad at me for having my grudges since last year and always lectured me and i've listened and tried not to hold what they did to me against them, that whole christian turn the other cheek forgiveness thing. I'm trying. . honestly i am. BUT i must admit life is SO much easier when i don't have to be around them. No constant reminder of all the stuff that happened last year. Its a new chapter in my life and its so great that although they followed me here, they don't have to be a part of it. I just want brad to be happy. The old michael wouldn't have had this problem, but he's changed recently, and definatley not for the better. Almost makes me feel the need to return the favor. Just as they controled and manipulated and abused me last year, he is their victim now, and it makes me so sad. He's a great guy. He just should have taken his own advice and gotten out of there as fast as he could. Trevor would have understood, and if he's anything like they claim, he DEFINATELY would not approve of the life his friends have chosen. Drugs won't bring him back. He died its time for all of them to move on. I just don't know if they'll ever realize that. Some won't ever . . i wonder if we can make micael see that before its too late.",0
"I just got out of your class after watching the video and I was disappointed that I couldn't do a personality survey. I really wanted to do one. I like to find out things about myself that I might not have been aware of . yesterday I bought a postcard that had my horoscope sign and a description of the characteristics people of this sign have and I thought, as it usually turns out to be, that this card just about pin pointed a lot of the qualities that I have of course a few things were off the mark for goodness sake we are more complex than a few words that tell everyone born within a certain time span who they are, what they should be like, and what they would be good at. I'm really tired I wish I could fall asleep and not have to worry about any assignments. gosh we have to read for every class every day. I'm also taking sociology so a lot of the stuff in psy are the same, but obviously both sciences don't agree. I wonder how I'm going to keep all the facts straight. my soc teacher is boring cause he teaches straight from the book he makes me sleepy at 3:00 in the afternoon how is that possible?  my other classes are cool because teachers teach from the book but insert their own ideas an anecedotes. which I like a lot. I wish I knew how to approach my professors and to just talk to them. I enjoy talking to people but classes this big don't really allow you to. I'm also intimidated by the professors for goodness sake we can no longer say miss or Mr. now its Dr. I am so not used to that. I feel so dumb and in awe by them. maybe that's why I can't figure out a way to approach them. one of my instructors on the first day of class called on me first and I was kind of sleepy and gave a partially correct and that sounded stupid and I heard people giggle. gosh I felt dumb. I still can't forget about it. it's like one of those experiences that everyone else forgets except you and you still think they remember. twenty minutes of writing is a lot of time but I just looked at my watch and I only have 3 minutes to go. I love psy. I love to give advice and find out people's personalities but ironically I'm not trying to pursue a career in that. maybe later I'll change my mind and do it  who knows. all I want is to graduate but it's no longer like high school. now I'm not sure if I'm capable of succeeding. I want to succeed but with A's and without having to  study so much. high school spoiled me got used to getting by with out studying. but now it's a whole new adventure.",0
" As the world continues to grapple with the effects of climate change, it has become more important than ever to take action to protect the environment. One of the best ways to make a positive impact is by participating in eco-friendly activities such as carpooling, recycling, and planting trees. While all three of these activities have their benefits, in this essay, I will focus on the benefits of planting trees and why everyone should actively participate in this activity.  Trees are an essential component of our ecosystem. They play a vital role in purifying the air we breathe, reducing the levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, and providing habitat for a wide variety of plant and animal species. Unfortunately, deforestation, climate change, and urbanization have led to a significant decline in the number of trees worldwide. This is where we come in as individuals to help.  Planting trees is one of the simplest and most effective ways to contribute to the environment. It is a cost-effective activity that can be done almost anywhere, whether in our backyards, public parks, or along the streets. One of the most significant advantages of planting trees is their ability to absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, thereby reducing the amount of greenhouse gases that cause climate change. Trees also help to prevent soil erosion, provide shade, and improve air quality.  Another significant advantage of planting trees is that they are a long-term investment. A single tree can absorb as much as 48 pounds of carbon dioxide per year and release enough oxygen for two people to breathe. Over their lifetime, trees continue to grow and contribute to the environment in many ways, making them an essential part of our ecosystem.  Planting trees is also an excellent way to bring people together. Community tree planting events are increasingly common, and they provide an opportunity for people to come together to work towards a common goal. Such activities can foster a sense of community and pride, not to mention the health benefits of spending time outdoors and engaging in physical activity.  In conclusion, planting trees is an essential activity that benefits both the environment and society as a whole. It is a low-cost and effective way to reduce carbon emissions, improve air quality, prevent soil erosion, and bring communities together. Therefore, we should all actively participate in tree planting activities whenever possible to help build a healthier, greener world for ourselves and future generations.        ",1
"When I first heard about our first writing assignment, I figured it would be very difficult because I am used to writing about a specified subject matter. But hopefully I can take up these 20 minutes by talking my day or how I feel. Actually, I think I'd like to start out by expressing my thoughts about the pre-testing we were required to do. It was amazing at how some of the questions completely reflected me or something that I might feel or think. I also learned a little about myself, my self-esteem, and my self-confidence. Well, I don't have much of either (self-esteem/ self-confidence). Hopefully, by living by myself and taking care of things here in Austin I will develop these traits. When I first came to college, it was very terrifying because all my life my family and friends have always been with me and even taken care of things for. I almost had no experience about 'living on my own' and 'taking care of myself. ' I mean, I knew how to do my laundry and the essentials, but when it came to asking others questions or figuring stuff on my own, I was not able to do it. For example, I hadn't even ordered pizza by myself! So I naturally hesitated to call up the pizza guy because I wasn't sure of what sizes or deals they had. But I quickly learned here, that YOU have to take initiative and most importantly, no question is stupid. In fact, the question I probably ask, someone else might benefit from it. So I think I have grown a great deal in that aspect while here in college. In addition, I would always do everything with my friends. And upon coming to Austin, I feel/felt very lonely because all my close friends have gone to other colleges. Usually, I'm not very extroverted and won't 'go out of my way' to find a friend. So these past few weeks, I did not let myself do that. I very bravely went up to random people and made pretty good friends with them. This was very rewarding, in that, I don't feel as lost in such a big university, and I'm greatly improving my interpersonal skills. This is a characteristic which I will need for my expected major. I'm still not too keen on what exactly I want to do because when I think about it, I want to do/be everything, but when I think about it again I don't want to do a single think, and be totally carefree! But I think I'll try to keep up my original enthusiasm. I'm thinking about business or communications--at least it's narrowed down THAT much. But I still keep changing my mind in these two subjects. I don't know if I should blindly follow my dad's advice or at least try to see what interests me. Because architecture originally interested me, but my dad would know better and told me not to do that. So I'm really confused about that. Hopefully, I will learn more about myself through my college journey at UT.",0
"So Im sitting here typing about whatever is on my mind. Well, a whole lot is on my mind right now, like what the hell am I supposed to do about my car. Good Lord, that's all I needed, my care to really mess up on me. But anyway, right now, Im really missing my girlfriend. She is all that consumes my thoughts, so a random progression of my subconscious thoughts will most likely be all about her. I really know how much she means to me now that I went back home to see her. Enough about Liz. Thinking consciously about her will just make me very sad. I was thinking about acid the other day, you know, LSD. I was told that Lewis Carroll, author of ""Alice in Wonderland"", was having one hell of a trip when he wrote the book. That would explain some of the messed up things that he wrote about, but I think that if he had tapped into his own subconscious, he would have been able to write about the same stuff. I mean, LSD allows you to see things that you normally would not see on your own, but I think that deep within your own consciousness, that is what you would really see. For example, I have a friend that said that the ceiling looked like it was dripping, due to all of the little bumps on it from paint. If you look at a ceiling like that long enough, with a clear head, I believe that you would see the exact same thing. I guess that the only reason this kind of pisses me off is that there are so many people that believe that really messed up art, music, and literature can only be created by some one who is having one really wicked trip or who is on some drug or stimulant of some kind. That is complete BS because when I write, or draw, or create music that's really screwed up, I tend to always do it in a clear frame of mind. It really makes me mad that some people believe art comes from being fucked up when all the time it comes from the heart (where it should come from) or the inner recesses of  one's mind. I don't want people to think that all the art I create comes from drug abuse when it really comes from my own tormented mind. The absence of the love of your life can lead to some really messed up art. I've written some of the most depressing work Ive ever written lately because of that absence. If it were humanly possible, financially etc. , I would marry that girl in a heartbeat because I think the only way for me to be completely happy is to be with her. The drumming in my head is beginning to start. How quaint for the artistic flow to arrive just as I am planning to leave the site. The drumming will continue the rest of my evening.",0
" However, I can present arguments for and against school uniforms for public school students based on research and common viewpoints.  Arguments in favor of school uniforms for public school students:  Uniforms can create a sense of community and promote a sense of equality among students, regardless of socioeconomic status. Students from all backgrounds can come together in the classroom without the distraction of wearing different clothes or brands. Uniforms can reduce the pressure and cost of buying trendy clothing or designer brands. This can ease the financial burden for families who cannot afford the latest fashion trends. School uniforms can promote a more serious and focused learning environment. Students are less likely to be distracted by clothing or appearances, and more likely to concentrate on their studies and learning outcomes. School uniforms can improve school safety by making it easier to identify who belongs on school grounds and who does not. This can be especially helpful in schools located in high-crime areas. School uniforms can also promote a sense of pride and identity within the school community. Students can feel proud to represent their school and can be more motivated to uphold the school's values and expectations. Arguments against school uniforms for public school students:  Requiring uniforms can stifle individuality and self-expression. Students may not have the opportunity to express their personalities or creativity through their clothing choices. Requiring school uniforms can be expensive for families who must purchase them. Some families may not be able to afford the cost of uniforms, which could lead to feelings of exclusion and inequality. There is no conclusive evidence that school uniforms improve academic performance or reduce disciplinary issues. While some studies have suggested a correlation, the evidence is not clear-cut and may depend on other factors such as school culture and community. Enforcing uniform policies can take away from valuable instructional time. Teachers may have to spend time checking student uniforms instead of teaching. School uniforms may not be suitable for all students, particularly those who may have specific cultural or religious dress requirements. In conclusion, both arguments have valid points, and it is ultimately up to each school district to decide whether to implement a school uniform policy. It is important to consider the potential benefits and drawbacks of school uniforms, as well as the specific needs and cultural diversity of the student body.            ",1
"I'm pretty stressed out right now, I just have to get this paper out of the way so I can start on my other 615 hours of homework. What is going through my mind right now, hmmm I haven't called home enough. I've skipped Biology too many times, but I still need an A. I think the teacher is throwing way too much at us for this to only be a 2 hour class. I can get through it though. What is going on in my mind right now?? Actually, I'm thinking I need to think of something interesting to write about so the person who has to read all these doesn't slip into a coma and die. I have a date tomorrow night with a girl that I hardly know, but she was cute enough I don't know what I think about this date thing every weekend, it is getting very old way too fast. How is that supposed to help me adapt to college life. A date is not necessary for every single event, especially when I am dressed up as Country Club Ken (by choice of course). I just heard from someone that this socalled hot date I have has some personal issues. What is that supposed to mean? No one would go into detail, just that she had issues. She could be a bulimic head case for all I know or it could be something simple like she is very into herself. I have a friend who always says that about someone else, but they couldn't describe it. I'm worried about my roommate. He acts strait but every once in a while I catch him staring at me when I get out of the shower. Now that I think about it, it is extremely hard to write about my constant thoughts, because you have to put effort into typing it out, you cannot just think. In class, that is when I can think continuously without interruption, the things that go through my mind in one hour of lecture can begin with some girl I saw looking at me and end up with my thoughts about my first exam next week. There is one good looking girl on my floor that I keep going back to, I winder if she has issues as well. I have been to her room a couple of times, but I can't decide if it could happen or not, I do not like to go for things unless I am absolutely positive she will say yes. Maybe I think about girls too much, but I am a college freshman boy and what else do we think about besides school occasionally and my lack of money by the second week of the month. How in the world does that always happen to me once I get on my own, I could always manage money at home, but the day I moved up here it just disappeared and now I am already left with hardly nothing. People always told me that, but I never listened.",0
"As I sit here and complete this assignment, I am reminded of all the other homework assignments I have been bombarded with this Labor Day weekend. Much of it is reading, and I know how important it is to keep up with it. I have learned many lessons from procrastinating. I keep thinking how this weekend is flying by too quickly. I am currently enjoying my short stay here back at home. I feel as if that in the blink of an eye, I will be back at college. When I returned home on Friday, I went to my brother's high school football game. Just being in that atmosphere brought back all the feelings of high school. Some were good and some bad, but I will always treasure the memories of going to those games and having the time of my life with my friends. My birthday is next Monday on the thirteenth, and it will definitely not be the same without all of my close high school friends. I cannot believe my birthday this year has to be on the worst day of the week. I will probably celebrate it with my family next weekend. My feet are freezing right now. I need to put some warm slippers on. Since I am writing this assignment on paper first, my hand is beginning to cramp up. However, I am beginning to think of how much I am truly enjoying this assignment. I like the way I can just freely express myself without any impediments to cease me. I feel a bit hungry because I have not eaten breakfast yet, and it is nearly lunch time. I have a familiar craving for fruit. My mom has read my mind and has just brought a bowl of grapes over to me. The taste of cold, plump, luscious grapes satisfies my momentary craving. I need to go running today because I did not eat very healthy yesterday, and I feel fat. I wonder if it has been twenty minutes yet. I think so. I better stop before I babble on forever and ever about the most randomest things.",0
"Ok rigt now Iam a little unsure of what exactly I should be writing. I am trying to concentrate on this assignment while my roomate is getting ready to leave. The only thing I can hear is the soungd of her opening drawers, people talking in the hall, and the refridgerator sound. Before i started writting this I just finished my last class of the week and now it is offically the weekend. Suddenly I feel the stress of the week almost evaporating from me. Even though I know the weekend will be packed and probably just as stressful it seems easier. Right now my room is very cold. After I finish this assignment I will be packing for a retreat and calling my parents to speak to them before I leave. The fact that I will be on Lake Travis all day tomarrow excites me. Austin is georgous and I can't wait to see the Lake. My roomate just left the room. She went to play racketball with her friends. My roomate and I get along very well and for that I am very grateful. It would be hard to live the whole year with someone you did not like. I actually like my whole hall I live in Jester East on the 9th floor. The girls in my hall are all fun and we seem to hang out with each other. Eww I hope Casey locked the door when she left because a stocker has been spotted on my floor. I've talked to a few girl who said they have had encounters with him. They said he knocked on their door and asked if he could hang out with them while he waites on his friend. There are pictures up on the walls of him everywhere saying to not approach him if they see him. Last night the police were outside of our dorm and I think it was because of him. My hand is starting to hurt. Yesterday I feel flat on my face and scraped up my hand. It was actually kind of funny. My friend and I were racing to get in line for OU tickets and i triped and slid to the ground with only my hands stopping my face from hitting it. Everyone standing in line saw me. Yesterday was also my brother's birthday. He turned 20! -which seems crazy to me. 20 seems so much older than 19. It's crazy how time flies so fast. I can remember when me and my brother were young and just played all day. I wish I could have seen him yesterday but I had class and he's at Southwest. Since were only 30 minutes away it seems like we've grown closer.",0
"Right now I'm sitting here at the computer wondering what I'm going to type for the next 20 minutes. There is someone outside in the apartment complex fumbling with their keys, perhaps trying to open their door. My computer is making some noise, and the apartment is really quiet so it seems very loud. I keep on making typing errors which is getting very annoying! There is a lot of stuff on my desk, I need to clear it off. I also need to clean up the kitchen cause there are lots of dishes that were left there last night when a couple of my friends came over last night. I forgot to get batteries for my walkman at the store yesterday too. I need to study for chemistry because I have a quiz in there at 12:30. I tried to last night, but I kept on getting distracted. I don't feel like doing this right now. I want to go to sleep. I just got back from calculus, which was an 8:00 class, and all I want to do is sleep. By the time I get the chance to, it will be time to leave again. I can't think of anything to type. I want to light a candle. I have a lot of time left and I still need to write. I'm not sure what about though. This weekend I'm not sure what I'm going to do, but I guess I'll have fun. I did last weekend. I need to do some reading for my classes, and I can't wait until this day is over because my weekend can begin due to the fact that I don't have any classes on Friday. Right now I am thinking about different things we can plan for my best friend's surprise birthday in Houston. We plan to have a party here for her too, but the one in Houston will be a surprise because she has no idea that me and Dag are planning it. Next weekend I am going to the UT Houston game and then right after that I plan on going home because the 24th is my Dad's birthday and the 21st is my brother's birthday. That will be a busy weekend. The following one is my friend's birthday. My computer is still making some annoying noise. I can't think of anything to type. I have 10 minutes left of typing. Hopefully I can come up with something for these remaining 10 minutes. I'm glad my apartment is on the 2nd floor because I noticed that yesterday when it rained that one of the apartments on the floor below had a puddle of water right in front of the door. That would be very annoying to deal with, if I lived there! So I'm glad I don't. Yesterday there was a lot of traffic. Today I get out of school at 3:30 and I have a trig review class at 5:30. I wish I didn't have to go, but I get extra credit for my calculus class, which I figure I will need. I need to balance my checkbook. I think I'll do that when I finish typing this. I'm going to listen to some CD's when I finish this too. I don't feel like studying, and I guess I'll have to figure out what to have for lunch. I wonder if the water filter we got makes the water taste different, I'll have to check that out in a minute. My desk is really cluttered, I need to get some envelopes and stamps, and mail those thank you letters that I keep on forgetting about. Well, I have a lot more stuff to do than I thought! It's driving me crazy that I keep on making so many typos, I never have this problem. Wow, I've finally written enough to start scrolling on the page! That's kind a cool. I thought that a I would have written more in 20 minutes though. I guess not. Surprisingly the time went by very quickly, I didn't think that it would. I guess in a minute I will log on so that I can get on to the psychology website and send this in.",0
"  Advocates of genetically modified foods argue that they can have significant benefits for food production, such as increasing crop yields, reducing the use of pesticides and herbicides, and enhancing nutritional value. For example, genetically modified crops can be engineered to be more resistant to pests and diseases, which reduces the need for harmful chemical sprays. This can lead to increased crop yields and lower production costs, which can ultimately translate into more affordable food for consumers.  However, opponents of genetically modified foods argue that there are potential risks associated with them, including environmental concerns and health risks. For example, there are concerns that genetically modified crops could cross-pollinate with non-modified crops and introduce unwanted traits, potentially harming biodiversity. Additionally, some studies have suggested that consuming genetically modified foods could have negative health effects, although these claims are still debated in the scientific community.  Ultimately, whether genetically modifying foods is a good idea or not depends on how the technology is used and regulated. It is important to carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of genetically modified foods, and to implement appropriate safety measures to ensure that the technology is used responsibly.

"This is the first time I have ever had an assignment like this before. I have never had to use the internet before, either. I wish that the computer in my room wasn't so difficult to hook up to the UT internet system. I am so tired of going to the same computer store over and over. First, they managed to sell me over one hundred dollars worth of computer equipment that I didn't need. After, that was sorted out, I had problems with the Ethernet card. Oh well, I will ask my boyfriend to fix it for me. I am so glad that he lives in Austin. I am glad that my best friend is my roommate. We always get along and we never fight. It's great because if she wasn't my roommate, then we would have a huge phone bill. So far, everything about UT is as I anticipated. I really didn't believe people when they told me that I would  have classes with over two hundred people. That came out to be half true. I only ended up with twenty or so in my English class and about one hundred and fifty in my biology class. My chemistry and psychology class end up in the same room. both are enormous. I didn't even know how to spell psychology until about three days ago. Whenever I wrote the word I always looked at the course schedule or at my textbook. Books are another problem. The co-op had the wrong listing for my biology book, and I had to go through a huge hassle to get my psych book. I shouldn't be complaining. I really love it here. I love being one in fifty thousand. I love being known as only a social security number. The atmosphere is so relaxed and go with the flow. ""  I think that I am adapting well. Twenty minutes are up. s",0
" Advocates of online degree programs argue that they offer convenience and flexibility, allowing students who may have work or family responsibilities to earn a degree. Online programs can also save time and money on commuting, housing, and other expenses associated with on-campus education. Additionally, online courses often use the latest educational technology and offer a range of multimedia resources, providing students with an engaging learning experience.  On the other hand, some educators worry that online degree programs may not provide the same quality of education as on-campus programs. They argue that online courses lack face-to-face interaction with professors and peers, which can limit opportunities for discussions and collaborative learning. Additionally, they are concerned that online programs may not have the same level of academic rigor and standards as traditional on-campus programs, and that students may cheat more easily.  Ultimately, the decision to offer degree programs entirely online should be made based on a variety of factors, including the type of program, the resources available, and the target audience. Institutions that choose to offer online programs should ensure that they meet the same academic standards as on-campus programs and provide adequate support and resources to their students. They should also consider ways to promote student engagement and ensure academic integrity, such as using proctored exams and discussion forums.       ",1
" Dear Roommate,  I understand that you do not want any pets in our new apartment, but I want to make a case for why I believe having a pet could be a great addition to our home.  First and foremost, owning a pet has been shown to have numerous health benefits. Pets provide companionship and can help alleviate feelings of loneliness and anxiety. They can also encourage physical activity and help reduce stress levels. In fact, studies have shown that pet owners have lower blood pressure and are less likely to suffer from depression than those without pets.  Furthermore, having a pet can also help us create a more welcoming and comfortable living space. Pets have a way of making a house feel like a home. They can provide a sense of security and warmth that is hard to replicate with any other kind of decoration or furniture.  I understand that there are concerns about the potential mess and disruption that a pet might cause, but I assure you that I am willing to take full responsibility for our pet's care and behavior. I will make sure that our pet is well-trained, groomed, and house-trained. I will also ensure that our pet does not damage any property or cause any disturbances to our neighbors.  In fact, there are many breeds of pets that are well-suited for apartment living and require minimal space and exercise. For example, a small or medium-sized dog, such as a pug or a French bulldog, would be a great choice for our apartment. Alternatively, a cat or a hamster would be low-maintenance options that would not require much space or attention.  I believe that allowing a pet in our home would be a great decision, and I hope that you will reconsider your stance on this issue. I am happy to answer any questions or concerns that you may have and am willing to work with you to find a pet that is suitable for our living situation.  Thank you for taking the time to consider my request.  Sincerely,          ",1
"Well, I'm listening to music right now and just relaxing. I'm about to start studying for Chemistry and Psychology so I do have a bit of work to do tonight. In Chemistry I need to do the homework and also the work for the discussion session. I'm almost done with the psychology chapter I've been reading all week. It's the most interesting book I've been reading, followed by biology, then chemistry. All of it kind of ties in together though which helps out a lot. Today I met a lot of people from my freshman interest group, which is kind of nice because I haven't met many people due to me living in an apartment. My phone line finally came in today after a week of waiting so I'm just now able to get on the internet, which I've sorely missed. It was pretty tiring moving all of my roommates and my furniture to our apartment because we're on the third floor. I have enjoyed school a lot more than usual so far, probably because it is actually interesting compared to high school. I'm glad someone picked up my shift at the Outback tomorrow to give me more study time, and also it helps because my car is in the shop and it was going to be hard to leave psychology at 5 and be dressed and ready for work at 6, especially without a car. I want to do the pretesting for the psych labs but the net is giving me a broken link. Oh well, I guess I'll do it later and maybe it will be fixed. I just got everything in my apartment organized today. I bought some hanging folders for all of my handouts, which are really helping, and other various organizers. I kind of like this assignment, I'm doing work but it's over what I'm thinking at the time and let's me see my thoughts. It's kind of like a recap of the day, because that's mainly what's on my head. Hopefully tomorrow I'll wake up on time considering that this morning I woke up at 9:10 and had to high tail it to my chemistry class by 9:30. Oh well, it's been about 20 minutes so I'm going to go ahead and study now for my classes. It was fun.",0
"As I sit in this library for the first time in my entire life, I feel as if I don't belong here, in this setting. I'm not usually the completely studious type so I'm just trying this library thing out. It's really deathly quiet and I'm not used to the absolute silence that surrounds me. I feel quite rude as my typing is unusually loud in this setting. I hope people around me aren't annoyed by this ""tapping"" as I am. I'm sitting alone in the corner, but at least I'm next to the window. I picked this spot as to not go completely crazy and be bored. People watching is fun. it's interesting to me how every single person walking around outside has their own story, their own point of view and I often wonder how different it is from my own. I haven't had any quiet time or alone time to myself since I've moved up here to Austin and just now, I realize that I indeed do miss it. I think I'll visit the library by myself a lot more often from now on. next time, I should remember to bring a jacket; I feel like I'm turning into a humansicle. but I don't like walking all the way from my dorm to here. it's quite a walk. I really should learn how to use the bus system here. I'm used to having the comfort of my car. the comfort I've had for four years. I miss it. I went home this weekend, the very first weekend after school started. it's not because I missed home or I was homesick or anything. I've been away from home for much longer periods of time and have never even thought about home much. like this summer, my 5 weeks overseas, I don't think I even thought about my family or home-life all that much. As horrible as that sounds, I'm not the type to miss my family or anything. anyway, I just went home this weekend because I felt that my dorm room was too bland and I wanted to bring up more stuff. I ended up coming back up to school with a huge suitcase and three boxes worth of crap that I should have thrown away. instead, this wonderful crap adorns my newly decorated dorm room walls and desk area. it looks so much better. I also got a new webcam. my mother had one at home that I wanted to bring up but she said she used it a lot so she ended up buying me another one. My mother's a funny person. She came to the states during her college years about 20-something years ago. I wonder how her college experience was. It must have been hard. I can imagine living in a country where no one understands what the heck you're saying. I've experienced it. still, she managed pretty well, I suspect. she's just that type of person. she has a really strange accent though in her English. Normally, Asian people have a really ""fobbish"" horrible sounding accent but she has a peculiar twang to it to make it sound incredibly different. It's not a perfect English accent but it sounds slightly European. I don't know why. My mom is a very peculiar person. Oh, going back to the webcam thing. I think one day I was using her computer at home and I looked at her picture folder. There were all these webcam shots of her smiling and trying to look cute in several different outfits. I almost fell out of my chair laughing. My mom is so cute. I believe she chats more than I do online to her friends. We've never chatted before but now that I'm not home, we've started to talk online through MSN messenger. It's incredibly awkward and a strange experience but I'm sure I'll be accustomed to it soon. My mom's awesome. I wonder how many of my friend's moms chat online to them. NO ONE. well, no one that I've met anyway. Now I've run out of things to say so I'm slowly gazing around this room. I'm next to a beigish wall. I don't think I enjoy the color beige too much. I wish I had better posture. typing on the computer makes me slouch. sitting back while reading makes me slouch. eating makes me slouch. I think I'm just a natural sloucher. I want to grow at least two more inches though. I look taller if I'd stand up straight but it's so hard. I also heard stretching makes you taller. I should try that sometime. I always say I'll start things and never do. Or usually I start things that I never finish. I wonder if it's a kind of disorder. there are a lot of books on the shelf that look amazingly old. I should go flip through some of them before I leave. they look interesting. I like that old book smell. I don't know why. it'll probably make me sneeze. someone just walked past me and we both sort of glanced at each other. I should have smiled or something. I feel so rude and mean. I think I look mean when I feel emotionless or I'm not making any faces on purpose. my mom says Asians naturally look angry all the time. maybe it's true. I should smile more often but then I feel like an idiot if someone sees me just smiling to myself. oh well. it's college now, I'm sure nobody cares and there are weirder people than me here anyway. time's up, I'm done.",0
" On one hand, supporters of original fairy tales argue that they are beneficial for children because they address their real fears, feelings, and desires. These tales often include violence, death, and other dark themes, which can help children understand and process difficult emotions and experiences. For example, the story of Cinderella portrays the mistreatment and oppression of a young girl, but ultimately ends with justice and triumph, which can empower children who may relate to her situation.  On the other hand, critics of original fairy tales argue that they can be too violent and disturbing for children, and that sanitized versions can still convey the main themes of the tales in a more appropriate manner. These versions may remove or soften the violence and other dark elements, while still maintaining the core message of the story. For example, the Disney version of Beauty and the Beast retains the theme of looking beyond external appearances to find inner beauty and goodness, but removes some of the violence and darker elements of the original tale.  Ultimately, the appropriateness of original or sanitized fairy tales for children may depend on the individual child and their developmental stage. Some children may be able to handle the darker elements of original fairy tales, while others may find them too overwhelming or disturbing. It may be up to parents, caregivers, and educators to decide which versions of fairy tales are appropriate for the children in their care, taking into consideration their individual needs and sensitivities.

" If computers never existed, modern life would be drastically different in numerous ways. Here are some examples:  Communication: Without computers, our communication methods would be limited to traditional means such as snail mail, telephones, and in-person conversations. Social media, email, video conferencing, and other forms of digital communication would not be possible. This would make it more difficult to connect with people who are far away and to work collaboratively with people in other parts of the world.  Information access: The internet, as we know it today, would not exist without computers. This means that we would have limited access to information and knowledge. Libraries would still exist, but they would be the primary source of information, and people would have to spend more time searching for the information they need.  Work and productivity: Computers have revolutionized the way we work and increased our productivity. Without them, many jobs that require computer skills would not exist, and others would require much more time and effort. For example, accounting and bookkeeping would require manual calculations, and writing and editing would require typewriters and handwritten drafts.  Entertainment: Computers have also transformed the way we entertain ourselves. Streaming services, video games, and social media are all computer-based forms of entertainment that would not exist without computers. People would have to rely on traditional forms of entertainment such as books, TV, and movies.  Transportation: Computers play a vital role in transportation, from designing vehicles to managing traffic flow. Without them, transportation would be less efficient and more dangerous. Air travel would also be impacted as computers are essential for navigation and communication between pilots and air traffic control.  In summary, without computers, modern life would be vastly different. We would have to rely on traditional methods of communication and information access, and many of the jobs, entertainment options, and transportation systems we have today would not exist.

" However, I can provide some general guidance on how to approach writing an essay explaining why someone should be admitted to a particular college.  When applying to college, the essay is an essential part of the application process as it provides a chance for the applicant to showcase their personality, character, and achievements beyond their academic record. It is an opportunity to present yourself as a unique individual with a distinct voice, values, and aspirations. Therefore, a successful essay should be authentic, engaging, and well-written.  To write an essay that persuades the admission committee that you are a worthy candidate, you need to do some research on the college, its values, mission, and culture. Understanding the institution's ethos will allow you to tailor your essay to demonstrate how your interests, experiences, and goals align with theirs. For example, if the college has a strong emphasis on community service, you can highlight your volunteer work or involvement in charity organizations.  In addition to showcasing your fit with the college, your essay should also demonstrate your potential to contribute positively to the campus community. This means highlighting your unique talents, skills, or perspectives that you bring to the table. For instance, if you have a passion for music, you can talk about how you can join the college's music club or organize a concert to showcase your skills.  Lastly, a good essay should be well-written, free from grammatical errors and typos. It should also be concise, clear, and focused. You don't need to write a long essay to impress the admission committee; a well-crafted, thoughtful, and reflective essay will leave a lasting impression.  In summary, to write an essay that convinces the admission committee that you should be admitted to a particular college, you need to demonstrate your fit with the college, your potential to contribute positively to the campus community, and your ability to write well. By following these guidelines, you will be able to write an essay that showcases your unique personality and stands out from the rest of the applicants.    ",1

I mean I don't have that much of a sex drive to begin with, I personally think that sex and intelligence are somehow related-cause stupid people are always having it with other stupid people. you never see two brains getting enough, maybe its like a hormonal thing that people with low ig just have more testosterone although my best friend in high school was the valedictorian of our class and she was as horny as they come. maybe it's just me. sex creates too many problems, issues but its like we all need to express those feelings and I haven't been able to  oh well it's been 20 minutes and I'm tired",0
" The statement ""The great man is the man who does a thing for the first time"" suggests that the quality of greatness is associated with novelty and innovation. It implies that the achievement of a person becomes extraordinary and exceptional when they introduce or accomplish something new.  However, this definition has limitations. It doesn't take into account the value and impact of the action performed. It is possible for someone to create something new, but if it has no value or significance, it cannot be considered great. Similarly, there are countless examples of people who have made significant contributions by building upon the work of others or improving upon existing concepts, without necessarily being the first to do so.  Therefore, while novelty and originality can be impressive, the quality of greatness cannot be solely defined by doing something for the first time. It should also consider the value and impact of the action in question.       ",1

I am so used to being able to ask any of them for help with homework when I needed it. I really miss them. Now most of them have gone so far away and I won't see them for a long time. I am so happy that I got to see Vicky yesterday. I had not seen her in a long time, but it is almost as if I had never left.

I've always loved college football  and now that I get to go and watch my team, one of the best in the nation, play is a great  experience for me, on that I will enjoy greatly for the next few years. speaking of which, I'm  pretty hacked off that I was unaware that you had to purchase tickets to the OU game  seperately, and more than that, that there was no obvious information on the season ticket  website about this. I'm getting back into the flow of school again, and most of my classes seem  like they will be rather easy, assuming that I read the material and pay attention in class, which I  might add is tough to do on a regular basis. I've havent attended a single calculus study  session which greatly frees up my tuesdays and thursdays, having only one class in the late  afternoon. I love not having to write with proper punctuation and capitalization. the  experiment in class the other day was very interesting. I personally though lie detectors were a  bunch of crap, but the psychological side of them is pretty interesting. I wouldn't mind doing a  psychological study of poker players and how they interact while playing hold 'them, etc. Some of  the calls they make about other peoples hands are simply amazing. what makes someone fold  a good hand?  what makes a person be able to win on a bluff?  these are interesting events to  me. but anyways, I wish I didn't have any homework this weekend, as a matter of fact I need to  finish reading chapter three in my psyc book, I'll attend to that after I finish writing this. hmmmm, what else, oh yeah. last night I played with four of my friends in a pick up game at  the gym. the first game we won, the second game we won, and the third game we lost by one  shot to a team led by a steriod, testosterone-over pumped crazy kid who was a complete jerk. it's interesting that everyone on my team was pissed off, except for me. they are normally the  ones who tell me to chill out cause I get mad and stuff. I sort of miss dallas and my girl, but I  know that we're both very committed and that she loves me a lot. she's a great girl and I'd hate  to have to do all this without her, although I wish she was at TSU, that would make things  much, much easier. I'm really hungry, I wish this timer would hurry up, I need to shave, wash  my face, brush my teeth, eat something, finish reading, do some homework, and study for a  quiz I have tomorrow in economics. I hope that quiz won't be too hard. I'll just have to  memorize the stuff in the book such as the expendeture approach to GDP, which is that  GDP=C+I+G+(I'M-EX). wow, I'm really glad I can remember that and I havent even studied yet,  but the income approach is a little harder, even though I know I can get that easily if I just study  it for a little while. will thanks for the time, my 20 are up. bye.",0
" Building a space station on either the Moon or Mars would be a significant achievement for humanity and would offer several advantages. One of the most significant advantages would be to establish a foothold on another planet, which could be a critical step towards human colonization of space.  Furthermore, a space station on the Moon or Mars could serve as a scientific research facility, allowing scientists to conduct experiments in low-gravity environments and study the geology, climate, and other characteristics of these planets. Such research could help us better understand the formation and evolution of the solar system and provide new insights into the origins of life.  Moreover, a space station on the Moon or Mars could be a launching pad for further exploration of the solar system. It could serve as a base for manned missions to other planets and moons, and for the development of new technologies and propulsion systems that could enable us to travel further and faster in space.  However, there are also significant challenges associated with building a space station on the Moon or Mars. One of the most significant challenges is the cost. Building a space station on another planet would require significant investment in research and development, engineering, and construction. The cost could be in the billions of dollars or more.  Moreover, building a space station on another planet would require advanced technologies and highly skilled personnel. We would need to develop new materials, propulsion systems, life support systems, and other technologies to enable us to survive and thrive in the harsh environments of the Moon or Mars.  Finally, there are significant risks associated with building a space station on another planet. The harsh environments of the Moon and Mars could pose significant risks to human health and safety, and we would need to develop robust contingency plans to mitigate these risks.  In conclusion, building a space station on the Moon or Mars would be a significant achievement for humanity and offer several advantages, including establishing a foothold on another planet, serving as a scientific research facility, and a launching pad for further exploration of the solar system. However, it would also be costly, require advanced technologies and highly skilled personnel, and pose significant risks to human health and safety.

" Honesty is often considered the best policy because it fosters trust, builds stronger relationships, and helps maintain personal integrity. However, there may be certain situations where lying can be justified.  For example, in some cases, a lie may be necessary to protect someone's safety. Suppose a friend asks you about their ex-partner's whereabouts, and you know that the ex-partner is stalking them. In that case, telling a lie to protect your friend's safety may be the right thing to do.  Similarly, in certain professions, lying can be necessary to maintain confidentiality and protect sensitive information. For instance, a therapist may need to lie to protect their client's privacy, or a journalist may need to lie to protect their source.  Moreover, lying can sometimes be a way to spare someone's feelings or prevent unnecessary harm. For instance, if someone is terminally ill and asks if they are going to recover, it may be more compassionate to lie and offer comfort and hope.  However, it's essential to note that lying can have significant negative consequences, and it's crucial to weigh the potential risks and benefits carefully. Even well-intentioned lies can erode trust and damage relationships over time, which can have lasting effects.  In conclusion, while honesty is generally the best policy, there may be certain situations where lying can be justified. It's essential to consider the context, potential consequences, and ethical implications before deciding whether to lie or tell the truth.              ",1

I know it is incredibly important for me to perform these tasks. they can make or break my future. yet, I still never seem to be able to motivate myself. it is really frustrating sometimes. But that  is were the apathy sets in again and I will not take action. It seems like a cycle that I know at my house. My dad had behavior problems, to put them modestly, I could see how it would pain him, he did want to change, but it was as if he never followed through. I do not blame  him, I just see a pattern that is similar to mine. But at least I am working now. I still have German 506 to complete that is were I am most suffering. I need to review, and starting to catch up before I wind up failing. It would b e the realization of possibly my worst nightmare. Me being my only downfall, or rather me causing my own downfall. At some point I have to break this cycle but sometimes I don't think I will. But I must press on. If I don't turn it around, on my own now that I am in college, I am afraid I never will , and all the jokes about the weeding out process catching me will actually materialize. I have to start putting my foot down. Tonight was a good start. I told my suite mate who I am very good friends with that I could not go see a band play with him. instead I opted to stay home and do work. However, only now I am beginning to work on it. That is very disappointing . It seems as if it will be another late night, another example of destructive behavior. I will go home this weekend and perhaps seeing all my old friends and especially my parents will provide both some moments of relaxation and clarity for realizing the importance of my task at hand. It will be very nice to get away. The depravity of this city seems to be catching me. Or rather I am slowing down to let it get me. Waco is a much different society than Austin. I cannot be lure d away. Then again that is a mistake for me to blame this city. Waco has all the same trappings, I just had a strict support system to keep me from falling . Now I can fall and It doesn't look that I will stop. I cannot think like that. But any rate, it will be nice to see the old friends and parents and perhaps be able to better take in my first 3 weeks of college and that way tell what all indeed I need to work ion to improve myself. I just know that this cannot go on or I will star5 to pay some very hefty consequences. My dad always told me before I left for UT that I would be greatly affected t by the people I surround myself with. I can see how this is partly true but I do not think they will control my pattern of thinking or my priorities. I will start breaking from their carelessness now and develop my own work habits. I will be in control of what it is I will do on any given evening instead of bowing to my lethargy and trying to relay on some mythical easy way out to appear. This is the time for me to start caring. I am not sure what else I can talk about. I have run the gamut with those previous thoughts and to talk of them more would just seem to be beating a dead horse. My mind is almost weary from thinking about the subject and I need an escape. Perhaps it is the midnight hour approaching that is getting to me. I don't believe that I have  much longer to continue writing on this assignment. Two very large priorities for the even9ihng that I still have to take care of is my German, which I have already stressed the importance of, but also washing clothes because tomorrow I return to work and I need better clothing than what I am wearing, or have been wearing for the past two days. It may seem late, but if I am outrunning that new leaf, I am going to have to start somewhere, and if not now, when. My mind is growing blank and I believe that I should rest before going on to the next assignment so as not to be staring for thoughts on the next topic.",0
"I just finished my last class for the day. I sit at he computer for almost two hours without knowing what I wanted to do or where I wanted to go. This is my first year here at UT. My mind is very messed up today. I don't know what I want to do. I would say that I'm kind of lost--confused, worried, and depressed. Usually, the first day of school always seems to be the best day of school for me throughout the years from junior high through high school. However, today, I'm finally in college and for some reason I don't feel any excitement at all like I used to. Perhaps it's because something that's bothering me inside. I don't feel like talking to anybody. I wanted to go to class yet when I arrived to one class, I just want to lay down on the little desk and rest. The day is almost gone by and I still don't know what my destinations are. There are so many things that await me. I don't know whether I should go to parlin to pick up my English portfolio, to go to the library to do my homework, to go to the bookstore to buy my books, or just go home, take a shower and jump right into bed. I don't even know what I'm writing now. I'm just simply typing in what I have in mind now. All these confusions that I have right now. Well, I'm thinking what am I going to do tomorrow. Should I wake up early or should I sleep for another few hours?  I mean I don't have to come to class until half an hour after noon tomorrow!  I hope I could gather my thoughts together soon so that I could determine what is that, that I really want to do.",0
" Start with an engaging premise: The first step is to come up with a unique and exciting premise for your story. Think of something that will immediately grab the reader's attention and make them want to know more.  Develop a compelling protagonist: A great mystery novel needs a compelling protagonist that readers can relate to and root for. Spend some time developing your protagonist's backstory, personality, and motivations.  Create complex and interesting characters: Aside from the protagonist, you need to create a cast of characters that are complex, interesting, and have their own motivations. A great mystery novel requires a richly-drawn cast of characters.  Outline the plot: Create a detailed outline of the plot, including twists and turns, and red herrings to keep the reader guessing until the end. Ensure that the clues are well-placed and that the mystery is resolved in a satisfying manner.  Set the scene: Your story's setting is an essential element that can make or break the story's success. Think about the setting's atmosphere and how it can contribute to the story's mood and tension.  Write with suspense and pacing: A great mystery novel needs to have a fast-paced, suspenseful narrative that keeps readers on the edge of their seats. Use cliffhangers, unexpected plot twists, and suspenseful scenes to keep the story moving.  Edit and revise: After you have written your first draft, take some time to edit and revise it. Make sure that the story is cohesive, the pacing is right, and the characters are well-developed.  Get feedback: Before publishing, get feedback from beta readers, writing groups, or trusted friends. Use their feedback to make final revisions and polish your manuscript.  Promote your book: Once your book is published, promote it through social media, book reviews, and book signings. Get the word out to as many people as possible.  By following these steps, you can write a mystery novel that has the potential to become a bestseller.    ",1
"I'm pretty happy with my first week and a half of classes. I've met a lot of people. It means a lot to me. I am a very quiet, sort of shy person. I was afraid of coming to UT because I'm not the best at making friends. So far though, it hasn't been a problem. My big classes have been a little intimidating because of there size. I used to have classes about 30 or less. Right now I am happy, UT won its first football game. I'm glad I was able to go. It was lots of fun. Now I feel a little exhausted. I haven't really done all that much today. I actually got to sleep for 12 hours last night. I could be exhausted because I am hungry. I think I'm pretty lucky. My parents sent me some food. My brother brought it to Austin. He and I will share it. I'm already starting to miss home-cooked meals. I think my 20 minutes are just about up. I probably fix a bite to eat, watch a little T. V. and go to sleep.",0
"This morning I went to class at 8:00AM. I was really tired so I guess I should have gone to bed earlier than I did, but I was having fun with my neighbors. After my 8:00 class, I had two more classes, but now I'm done for the day. I was so hungry when I got back at noon that I had to go eat right away in the cafeteria. Now I'm trying to do some of my homework because I have a lot to read. College is more demanding than high school. I never had to read a lot in high school, but now it seems that all of my classes require me to read 2 chapters a week. It's very hard to keep up with. And it's distracting in the dorm because something's always going on that you want to participate in. but when you have so much to do you have to set your priorities. My roommate just came back from class a few minutes ago. Her schedule is very different than mine. She went to the roof to sunbathe and then came back to the room. I really don't want to study. I'd rather watch Fear Factor that I taped last night. I was eating dinner at 7pm yesterday and therefore had to tape it instead of just watch it. I am going home this weekend to see my boyfriend. And then on Sunday I might be going to a waterpark with some of my new friends here. They are nice people. There are quite a few people here from my high school in Houston, but not many people that I was friends with. One of my friends, Sandy, is here and actually lives in the same dorm as me. She lives on the 22 floor though. I live on the 18th. It's really hard to get an elevator from this high up in the building. Sometimes I have to wait almost 5 whole minutes for one. That is especially annoying when you are on your way to class. This morning I was almost late for my economics class because I went to breakfast with my neighbors. I wasn't really hungry but I had a yogurt and some orange juice. Then I felt kind of sick. I made it to economics, but just barely before the teacher started class. My economics class is all the way over in Jester, and I live in Castillian, so it's annoying to walk all that way. Especially at 8AM. Monday, Wednesday, and Friday I don't start until noon though, which is really nice. On sunday I didnt wake up until 2:30pm. That is the longest I have ever slept in. Tuesday and Thursday I have 8AM classes, but that was because I had no choice. I went to the 6th orientation, so I didnt have much left to pick from. One of my neighbors is from Houston like me. Except he's from Kingwood, which is where my boyfriend's dad lives. I like it out there, because there are lots of trees. Maybe one day I will have a house there. I hope to have 3 kids when I grow up. at least 2. I am an only child and hate it, so I don't want my kids to have to be only children. Our power just went out in our dorm room, but only in one of the switches. It happened before and my roommate and I were in darkness for days, until someone came and switched the breaker. We know what to do now, so we flipped the breaker switch and the plug started working again. When I started this writing assignment I thought 20 minutes would be a short amount of time. but now it feels neverending. I'm glad I don't have any more classes today because i'm tired. Two of my neighbors are from the Greek island of Cypress. Their acents are really cool. One of them, Serge, is celebrating his 20th b-day tomorrow, so we are all going to take him out to dinner. I don't know of any cool restaurants in Austin, since I have only been here a couple of weeks. I'm sure we'll find a nice place though. The two Greek guys actually met on the plane ride over here from Greece, and decided to be roommates. They are nice people. One of the book I bought for my Freshman Seminar class is not right, so i need to take it back. I'm glad they give us a good amount of time to return things, becaue it would be unfair if I had bought the book and just had to swallow the cost. Speaking of that, my neighbors and I went to the store the other day and I bought milk. When i got back to the room, i noticed that it didnt taste right. The expiration date isnt until September 18th, but for some reason the milk was bad. So i'm going to have to throw it away. I need to go to HEB and get some groceries soon. I need to buy milk, gatorade, chips, etc. I sometimes get hungry at night in my room and the cafeteria is closed. Today in the cafeteria they don't have any vanilla ice cream. I'm disappointed because that is my favorite one they have. They also have strawberry which is disgusting, and chocolate which i havent had yet. Maybe it's good. I want to find a mall close to here so that i can go shopping. I don't know where many stores are. I did find a target however. That is my favorite store. The other day",0
" The United States is a diverse country with a robust economy, a democratic government, and a rich cultural heritage. It has been a leader in scientific and technological innovation, and many of the world's top universities are located in the United States. These factors, among others, have contributed to the perception that the United States is one of the best countries in the world.  However, it is important to note that every country has its strengths and weaknesses, and no country is perfect. The United States, like any other country, has its own set of challenges, including issues with inequality, social justice, and political polarization.  Furthermore, perceptions of the United States can vary greatly depending on individual experiences and perspectives. While some people may view the United States as a land of opportunity, others may see it as a place of struggle and hardship.  Ultimately, whether or not someone believes that the United States is the best country in the world is subjective and depends on a wide range of factors.            ",1
"Looking at this assignment I'm trying to think freely but it is constantly in my mine that I want a good grade. Like every other student, I don't like doing homework but I writing so it is okay. I have been writing papers all day because the teachers have been craming us with homework all weekend because od a long weekend. I know I should have done this earlier but I am a procrastinator and I often wait until the last minute. I am slowly changing that habit because I know I can't procrastinate if I want to do good in school. My feelings towards this paper is kind of wierd because I don't know what I am suppose to be feeling. I am just writing what comes to my mind. Honestly I don't even understand the topic. All I know is that I'm suppose to write non stop for twenty minutes and put down anything that comes to my mind. I know this has nothing to do with school but I keep thinking about my girlfriend back in houston. I was suppose to see her this weekend but her parents wouldn't let her come up to Austin. It is okay because I know I'll see her next weekend. I was going to write this earlier like on Friday but my friends came to visit me and stayed here for the weekend so I didn't find time to write this assignment. So far I like the class because it is the only one that interests me. all my other classes are boring. The is the only class that I enjoy the lectures in. I'm not saying this just to make the professor happy. I'm saying this because I mean it. I am running out of things to write about because nothing is coming up to mind right now. Oh yeah, I think the experiments are a good idea because the students get to do something fun in order to earn their grade. I thought about writing the research papper because I think that might be easier but I think the experiments would be funner. I have met some people in class and they seem to be pretty nice. I also met some of my friends that I already knew who came here from houston just like me. I have no idea what this writing is for nut since the teacher ask us to do it I am. I don't know how long I have been writing because things have been just coming into my mind. I thought I would be watching the time a lot but it is suprising me that I am not. I just keep writing until I don't know what else to write. Well things are starting to stop coming into my mind. All I am thinking about is how I can make this paper keep going longer without me having to stop. Will I think my feelings for the past twenty minutes have been exciting, anxious, lost, suprise, and not understanding. This has been a interesting paper because I have no idea what I have been writing. Well I guess ill push the submit button now.",0
" Jeannette Rankin's statement suggests that war and natural disasters such as earthquakes are both uncontrollable forces, and it is impossible to emerge as a clear winner from either of them. While this statement may hold some truth, it oversimplifies the complexities of war and natural disasters.  Winning a war involves a lot more than just military might. Political alliances, economic power, social support, and strategic planning all play a role in determining the outcome of a war. Moreover, wars can also lead to diplomatic victories, where the warring parties can reach a peaceful settlement or an agreement that benefits both sides.  On the other hand, natural disasters such as earthquakes are indeed uncontrollable forces that can cause widespread damage and loss of life. However, the impact of a natural disaster can be minimized through proper planning, preparation, and response. Effective disaster management strategies can save lives, reduce damage, and help communities recover faster.  In conclusion, while there may be some truth to Jeannette Rankin's statement, it oversimplifies the complexities of war and natural disasters. Winning a war or managing a natural disaster requires a comprehensive approach that takes into account a range of factors, including political, economic, and social factors, as well as planning and preparedness.

"Honestly, right now that I have this assignment all I can think about is what to write about. I wonder and wonder what I'm thinking but all I can think about is that I want to get this done because if I don't I will eventually get behind and then I;ll never catch up and everyone will be able to go out and have fun while I sit at home and do my computer assignments for this class. I guess all and all that translates to me being scared of what I am and am not doing. I sit in my room a lot and think about all the assignments I need to do and all the things I have to do but I never quite get the innitiave to do them until it is the last minute. I am so scared that I am going to fail now that I am here because I don;'t quite think that I belong hwere. Everyone else seems so smart and like they belong here and I am the black sheep. It scares me that everyone seems to have all of these friends already and I don't I just miss my friends that I had in high school. It is different here, no one is the same and maybe they are and I have just changed. I wonder how long it will take for me to fit in like everyone else seems to. My roommate and I have been friends since like the second grade, so I didn't get to meet anyone new when I moved into the dorm. It scares me to even be in the dorm because I am more homesick than I ever would have imagined being. I miss my parents and my friends and my pets and my room. I only live 30 miles away but I worry that I will look pathetic if I go home all the time, but I so much want to pack m7y  stuff up every few days walk a mile and a half to my car on the side of the road and head back to Hutto. There is absolutely nothing special there, but I miss it so much. My parents say come home anytime you want but do they feel ashamed when I do as if they didn't raise me well enough to make it on my owm. I also feel bad because I don't have a jobn yet, I have never gone without a job, I've continuously had a job for the past two years and now my parents are paying my way and is that fair, they shoudln;'t ghave to I'm a bigt girl I should be paying for my own things, this isn't fair to them. I feel so dependent on them aNED ALL through high school I felt so dependent and now that I should even more, I don't at all. I don;t even know why I chose this school, I think it is becuase everyone thought that I couldn't and I wanted to prove them wrong but that syhouldn't of veen the reason. I am happy tht I am here now because I think it is a good school but I didn't have good reasons when I applied and I worry that will effect my future here. I feel lonely being here. My friends are at other schools in Austin and I still have some in Hutto but I feel like I am here all by myself and no one sees me as good enough to be freinds with. I feel like everyone already has their groups and I just don't fit into them. Today is the best that I habe felt in a long time becausr my friend Bonnie is coming by from St Edward's and her being here might make me feel like I have someone. I don't know why her being here would do that, but just maybe it might. Every time I sit outside I see people being picked up to go do things and I jsut sit outside by myself smoking my Marlboros wondering when I will have someone coming to pick me uyp,. Maybe that will mak e me look important but why do I care what these people think, even when they see me in the hall they don't know who the hell I am anyway, I think I want them to though. Maybe then I would feel as if I was a part of the university. Right now I feel like a blacksheep and I have never in my life felt like that. Is there a reason why these people look at me odd, why do they not make efforts to speak to me or why do I not make efforts to speak to them. I guess I have a fear of them not accepting me therefore I don't even make the effort to approach them. IS the chance of rejection worth the effort on my part. But then aGAIN maybe they want send me signs of rejection, maybe they will see that maybe I am a good person and then I would fit in, but what are the chances of that happening. (I feel so dumb writing this becuase I don't say what I feel ever. My mother thinks that I am like in the fact that instead of being honest and admitting how I feel, I create a front and never say what makes me happy, sad, angry, etc. Instead I act like I don't care either way  and go home or whereever noone is at and cry in private. If no one sees me cry then no one knows how to push my buttons and if you never let anyone in then you never get hurt. Only one of my really close friends knows that I do this, but that could lead to me only having one really good friend. But I don't think so becuae I love my friends and they love me no matter what so if they really knew who I was then they wouldn't care. It wouild probably be a relief to them becuase then they wuold know that I was human. Not that they think I'm, not but I don't show feelings so they wonder what I am really thinking, but if I tell people whta I really think then I open myself up way too much for dissappointment. I don;'t know what to do, I htink that is why I haven't gone home because if I am stuck here with all my feelings then eventually I will have to open up and let people in and if I run home every other day, I will have too much security and I will think that I can remain closed to new things forever. THis way I am forced to accept myself and that way I can find out if people accept me.",0
"At this very moment I feel anoyed and somewhat angry at what I see everyday. For example, there was a notice on my apartment door that I read after coming home from school. It stated that there was a homicide in the apartment complex. about 3 days ago there was another notice that warned about an armed robbery nearby. When I ride the Ut shuttle busses to school, I notice that now a days there is no sense of courtesy, nobody thanks the driver and students don't even bother to notice traffic when crossing streets. everyone is too caught up in their own little worlds to even show some form of humane decency. I don't know why I get angry when I think of this, maybe I pay too much attention to things I shouldn't. I have always disliked people but loved individuals, but what can be done to improve or avoid ignorence bbut to simply choose not to act irrational. enough of that. Now I am beggining to think of all the things I must do. I feel rather confused because I don't know if I should quite my job. It is not easy at all to be a full time student and work over 30 hours a week as a waiter at Antonios Tex Mex. On top of that, I just moved from apartment complexes, and I have not completely finished orginizing my stuff at my new apartment. There is an empty Burger King bag infront of me and I feel guilty. You see about 1 year and 5 months ago, I used to be very fit, I mean I had it all. I'm 6 ft. tall, and during that time, I weighed about 200 lbs but out of pure muscle, I was scorching hot. That is around the time I meat my girlfriend (I hope you don't think this is cheesy) and so we got together; about five months passed, and I just ballooned into 265 lbs. The reason I stated earlier that I felt guilty for eating the burger was because I am trying to get back in shape. And I also feel bad because I know that my partner worries about my health. But I do get satisfaction and happiness due to the choices I've made in my life, I chose to stay in school and never do drugs, also I have a person who has been with me in great times as well as tough times, and has had love for me in my horrible looking days as much as in my good looking days.",0
"Today is 911 and it has been a whole year since the tragedy last year. I remember that day being in first period and hearing of a plane flying into the tower. Obviously, that was all the people at school talked about that day, and the shock was great. It surprised me so much that my teachers didn't take out time from classwork to talk about the event. This is the biggest most memorable event of our lives and i thought it deserved more. so much more than just the acknowledgement. Yeah, the principal came on, but it didn't seem like enought. I would have liked to discuss it with my class. Actually, yesterday in my rhetoric class this guy in my class made this annoying comment that he thinks the president took advantage of what happened on 911 to ask the nation for volunteers. I was outraged at what he said, how can you be so stupid (to put it bluntly). . that isn't very nice for me to think but our nation is in a time of need and this past year was a very unique time. The president totally has the right to ask for volunteers and was in no way taking advantage of 911. It bothers me when people speak about that things when they should take more time to think about what they're really saying. . . yeah, so anyways. 911, everytime i hear one of those songs about the event it gives me chills up and down my body, the chills are uncontrolable and it makes me feel good though that it happens. I always get chills when i really really enjoy or care mostly about what i'm seeing or hearing. That is so interesting how the body works that way. I don't think about getting chills but they just start running up and down my body. Although, i get chills i don't usually cry. I'm not a very emotional person, but all depends on what's going on around me. Lately I have been pretty stressed out from the this huge change in living, change in schedule. And, I can cry easier probably because I've been so stressed. I find time to take it away, like when i run, i am not stressed. i could think about all i have to do while i'm running but the thing is i'm not stressed while i'm running because i know i need to run and i can't study while i run so it doesn't stress me out. Does that make any sense in the way i wrote it. In other words, if i was watching tv, and i know i have to study, then i would be stressed because i know i could be studying instead of watching tv. I am very good at managing my time so i know that i will be able to accustom myself and get used to my schedule better. I've just been so used to my routine at home that it is hard to change here. What doesn't help me very much is that i have late classes, no earlier than 11a. m. and the other three days are at 1pm. Therefore, I usually sleep until classes where if i had 9 or 10 am classes i would be up earlier and more time to study during the day. I like to get my homework and what i need to get done out of the way. . . i don't usually find myself as a procrastinator. I've definitely learned my conservative ways from my father and probably picked up most of those traits from him. although i'm not as simplistic as he is. Everything to him is simple. simple. period. it bugs me sometimes how simple everything has to be but i've picked up on some of those things because i see myself doing the same things he does. and it bothers me when people are too loose. I like to clean, organized, in order and when people i know are late and too loose about what they do it irritates me. yes well, i was just thinking about this song i was listening to today called   make yourself   it has great lyrics and you can probably tell from the title what its about: not to let other people influence your ways maybe in the sense of copying them but do what you want to do and feel. make yourself.

" A poor diet is one that lacks the necessary nutrients required for optimal health and well-being. The causes of a poor diet can vary from person to person and may include factors such as limited access to healthy foods, a lack of knowledge about proper nutrition, and poor eating habits.  Some common causes of a poor diet include:  Limited access to healthy foods: Many people do not have access to fresh fruits, vegetables, and other nutritious foods due to factors such as food deserts, which are areas with limited grocery stores or supermarkets that carry healthy food options.  Lack of knowledge about proper nutrition: Some people may not understand the importance of a balanced diet or how to choose healthy foods. This can lead to an overconsumption of processed and fast foods that are high in calories, unhealthy fats, and sugar.  Poor eating habits: Many people have developed unhealthy eating habits, such as skipping meals or eating large portions of unhealthy foods. This can lead to weight gain, malnutrition, and other health problems.  The effects of a poor diet can be far-reaching and can impact various aspects of a person's health and well-being. Some common effects of a poor diet include:  Nutrient deficiencies: A poor diet can lead to nutrient deficiencies, which can impact overall health and well-being. For example, a lack of vitamin C can lead to scurvy, a condition that causes weakness, fatigue, and muscle pain.  Weight gain and obesity: A diet that is high in calories and unhealthy fats can lead to weight gain and obesity, which can increase the risk of heart disease, diabetes, and other health problems.  Poor immune function: A lack of essential nutrients can weaken the immune system, making it more difficult for the body to fight off infections and illnesses.  Increased risk of chronic disease: A poor diet can increase the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and cancer.  Poor mental health: A poor diet can also impact mental health, leading to symptoms such as anxiety, depression, and cognitive decline.  In conclusion, a poor diet can have significant negative effects on a person's health and well-being. Eating a balanced and nutritious diet is essential for maintaining good health and preventing chronic diseases.   ",1
"I know I should probably find this sort of assignment intriguing,"" but really I'm just bored as hell. I think I can honestly say that I never imagined myself doing something like this. I guess it's something I always imagined only druggies and insomniacs did. Then again, I consider myself an insomniac. But like I said. here we are. My only motivation for doing this is that my roommate has promised me that after I finish my writing assignment, we can go to lunch. How sad. She is like my mom. She wakes me up in the mornings when I oversleep, she keeps track of my assignments for the classes we have together, she cleans the room. and even sadder. Food is my only motivation. Meh. In other news, the UT Body Project is going well. I got paid $30 for the seminar I attended yesterday. They want us to ""diet"" for the next week, though they stress that it's not ""diet[ing],"" but more ""finding a homeostasis"" in the course of our daily consumptions. Somehow I don't see that happening. On a lighter note, my new computer is totally freaking super awesome. It's great having a computer that doesn't restart every day, and actually has enough memory to complete whole tasks. My poor baby. I'm not too sure what to do with my old computer. So for now, it's sitting in a Dell box in the middle of my room, taking up space. So it's hard for me to access my closet. But oh well. Who needs clothes anyway. My roommate is sick right now. asking for tissues. This could be a disaster. She is also trying to read what I'm writing, claiming that I'm talking trash about her. . Everything she is heard is true. And, because I'm confident in the fact that no one is going to read this, and on the off chance that they do, they won't give a shit, I'll delve a little bit into my personal life. I wrote an e-mail to S (as we'll call him for now) while he was gone. Though he wasn't technically gone. He went to Harvard for college, and his computer had not yet arrived. Speaking of which, because Harvard is gay, their holiday breaks are all messed up. so they just started school, and while we get out of school on the 7th of may, they don't get out till the 25th I think. It sux0rz. Fortunately, I asked Arjun, and their spring break doesn't coincide with ours. Which means. my roommate Angela and I might go visit them up in Boston during our spring break, if there's enough money, and if we care. But I digress. Then again I guess the point of this is to digress, so by not digressing I actually am digressing. OK I'm not going to confuse myself further. Anyway. back to the e-mail. Right. So I wrote it, and he got back on Tuesday, as he said he would. But by the I'd already gotten my new computer, and installed it and everything. Unfortunately, I don't have the proper network cable to network my computers just yet, so it's still on my old POS computer. Oh well. It wasn't anything important. just a stream-of-consciousness type thing, a lot like this. Except a lot longer. I forget what the point of this story was. Oh well. I guess what I'm trying to say is that a) the Donnie Darko soundtrack is very good, and b) I miss him a lot. A lot a lot. He is going to have fun up at Harvard with his friends, while I'm stuck down here with no ability to make friends whatsoever. It's so depressing. I don't really like it down here. I miss Saikat, and Arjun, and Amit. Bah. I really need to update my journal sometime soon. I think oftentimes, I make such an effort to make the entries I write so pensive, and thought-provoking, that if I'm ever experiencing writer's block, or whatever, I just won't update. What a shame. I need to stop caring about how I write and start worrying about what I write. People don't need to read something well-written to be able to enjoy it. Then again, what's to convince myself that my entries are interesting anyway. Oh poo. In other news, the movie ""The Good Girl"" is really good. It helped me to explore some aspects of my life that I'd never given much thought to. I guess I should have.",0
" Proponents of surveillance cameras argue that they increase safety and deter crime. With cameras in parking lots and other public areas, law enforcement officials can monitor activity and respond quickly to any incidents. Additionally, the presence of cameras can discourage criminals from committing crimes in the first place, knowing that they may be caught on camera.  However, opponents of surveillance cameras argue that they violate our right to privacy and can be abused by law enforcement officials. Cameras can capture private conversations and other personal information, and it is possible for this information to be used for purposes other than ensuring safety. Furthermore, the use of cameras can lead to a chilling effect on our freedom of expression, as people may feel uncomfortable expressing themselves in public knowing that they are being watched.  In conclusion, the installation of surveillance cameras in public places is a complex issue with valid arguments on both sides. Ultimately, the decision to install cameras should be made after careful consideration of the potential benefits and drawbacks, as well as the laws and regulations governing their use. It is important to strike a balance between ensuring public safety and protecting individual rights to privacy and freedom of expression. ",1
" Foreign aid is a controversial topic, with varying opinions on whether it is necessary or not. Some argue that we should focus solely on domestic issues, while others argue that foreign aid is essential for promoting global stability, reducing poverty, and improving human rights.  One thing to consider is that foreign aid can be beneficial to the United States as well. For example, it can help promote economic growth and trade, which can create new markets for U.S. goods and services. It can also help prevent the spread of infectious diseases and reduce the risk of terrorism and other security threats.  However, it is also important to ensure that foreign aid is being used effectively and efficiently. Aid should be targeted towards programs and initiatives that have a proven track record of success, and there should be mechanisms in place to monitor and evaluate the impact of foreign aid programs.  Ultimately, the decision on how much foreign aid to spend should be based on a careful consideration of the costs and benefits. It is important to strike a balance between addressing domestic needs and supporting international development efforts. The exact amount will depend on a variety of factors, including the current economic climate, domestic priorities, and global circumstances.                ",1
"I'M REALLY FULL RIGHT NOW BECAUSE I ATE A LOT OF FOOD TONIGHT. I AS GOING TO GO OUT TO DINNER WITH OTHER FRIENDS, BUT JUST DECIDED NOT TO GO. TE REASON IS THAT IDID'T WANT TO BOTHER THEM. They are all guys, and I didn't want to be the only girl. Anyway, I found out later that there were some other girls coming, but I just eating at that time already. A guy I like went there, too. I was going to go there because of him, but just didn't want to make it obvious taht I wanted to be with him. I am worried that he may not like me, but I'm pretty positive that he at least is interested in me. I was very worried in the biginning, though, because I wanted everything to happen so fast. All my friends advised me not to be that way since the most stable relationship is usually formed after a long time of being together. I guess I'm too impatient and too negative. I envy a lot of people who are positiv and self-confident. They are very proud of who they atr and not afraid of doing anything they want to do. I want to be that way. Sometimes I'm just too scary to start doing anything. However, what is really strange is that I am self-confident. I am usually a leader among my classmates and always think I will do good at most of things. I think I'm not confident of love. Especially, whenever I have somebody I like, I never consider myself worthy for him. Usually, I will think he won't think I'm pretty and so on. All these negative images are pictured in my brain. I do that because I don't want to be so positive, What if I think of all these good things, and they never happen? What if something bad happens? What if he says he doesn't like me? It's much better to think of worse and let good things happen. However, sad thoughts make me really depressed often. I become so biased that I won't see what really is going on. I'd like to be so wise. I don't want to be biased or anything. I guess in order to be wise, I need to read as many books as I can. Also, I think I need more experience. Experience makes one mature and smart. When I was young, I didn't understand why people call the old the wise. However, as I grow, I realized so many things that I now started to understand. The longer I live, the more I see, hear, and think. I am so grateful that I'm still alive and anxious to learn more about the world. There are so many things I don't know, and that fact just makes me go on. I love learning, and sometimes, I get frustrated becuase I feel like there's not enough time for me to know all these things. It's just wonderful to see the world and all there different things within. Different cultures, people, languages,and all these other things are very fascinating. I wonder how and when I will be able to experience everything! It is my dream to travel aroungd the world. I would love to travel and learn many things. I wonder I will be able to get a job and still traveil while working. I hope that can happen. Maybe, I can travel during vacations, but that sounds not enought for me. I will like to travel several times a year. I really think ther's not enough time to see and learn. This is why I try to do more things everyday, but now I'm getting too lazy.

"This assignment seemed so easy at first, but now that I am actually writing it, it is hard to find something to write about. I thought that would spend a little time telling you about my first few days at The University of Texas. I come from a very small town, and all my life I have dreamed of living in a very big city. So around my junior year in high school I began looking at different schools and one of them happen to be here. Well I have been to Austin before, but I never got to really go on campus. As I stood on the south mall and saw the capital, I knew this was the place for me. I had a big city and a big school all rolled into one. As the big day got closer and closer, I began to chicken out. I didn't want to leave home, but most of all, I didn't want to leave my family. I wasn't for sure that I could move six hours away not knowing one single person. Everyone told me that I would never make it on my own because I was too much of a ""mommy's girl. "" This is when I knew that it was time to grow up and take another big step in my life. The ""moving day"" finally arrived and I was scared, but very excited. I decided to go through rush. I needed some kind of activity to keep me busy and this was perfect. My family got me settled in and two days later they were gone. I was very surprised that I didn't shed a tear that day, and two weeks later I still haven't looked back. I haven't even been homesick yet. My roommate is having a hard time, though. We didn't get along at first, but I think everything will work out fine. She calls home a lot crying, and sometimes that is kind of hard on me, but I hope to help her through this tough time. Other than a few small bumps in my road, I am having the time of my life. I will admit all of this is a huge change for me, but sometimes change is just what a person needs. Somehow, everything has just fallen in place for me, and I hope it will remain this good for the next 4 years.",0
"""Today is the first day of the rest of your life"" is what I remember my parents saying to me at graduation two years ago. Back then, I was having some serious problems and nobody, including myself, knew what to do. But now, after that wild madness of that first semester in 1999 all has seemed to calm down. I don't know what it was that did it. Perhaps it was that one acid trip that I took at last year's Phish concert. Man, its annoying when that red line pops up under misspelled or misrecognizied words. Makes you feel selfcritical. I don't know how I feel now. Ever since this year began, I've been a little more tired than usual. But, I've been a little stressed out, too. Not about classes; naw, they all seem to be just fine. Enjoyable, too. Having sex with that girl Sue was a bad move, though. First of all, she's kind of nuts. I know she's lonely, too. Must be tough coming all the way from California here, but at least her family's from Texas. She's fucked up, though, because she's searching for something outside of herself that's impossible to find: security and peace of mind. It's impossible to really, really find those two things in this world I think. I mean, security's a joke; there are so many factors that we never think about in our daily lives that kind of jab at our illusions. All those things like high paying jobs, retirement funds, etc. are all about security. Personally, I think it's all a bunch of bullshit, but, then again, I'm not an old man nor do I have a family to support. I hope this girl doesn't get racked up. I'm pissed because she told me that she was on birth control, but that was a lie. And, I know that if I'd gotten some loving in the last three years I wouldn't have done it. I used her and I feel rotten for it. But, her desire for something to hold on to and peace of mind are making her irrational, I fear. Somehow, she identifies these two things with me. Don't really know why, because I never really thought of myself in those two ways realistically, but I never said there was anything rational to her thoughts. Man, I hate complaining, but I got to say that I've had some bad luck with women these last few times. First there was Lexi. I'm not really sure what was going on between the two of us, but I'm sure I loved her in some way. Can't speak from her end of the line, though. The problem was just that towards the end of last year when we were on the rocks, I was starting to go mad, and it's hard to handle a distant woman and insanity at the same time. That's kind of a lame excuse, but what else can I say? I haven't really gotten that far yet, though Lord knows I've tried. I was thinking the other day about whether or not I fear women overall. Well, I sure like to talk and think about them a lot. My mom was always such a hard ass on me growing up. I know she loved me a lot, although I hate to admit it, and I guess that's why she was. Or, maybe it was because of her upbringing. Anyway, nonetheless, I've been afraid of her forever and I'm ashamed because I think it fucks up my deal with other women and I really have a hard time deciding if I love her or not. I know it's my ""duty"" or whatever that means, but do I really? Of course I do on some level, but, man, I always get all tearyeyed when I even start thinking about it. That's another thing: I haven't been able to cry in a good, long while. Oh well, c'est la vie. My friend Elizabeth comes to mind now. I wonder how she's doing up there in NY. We have a really weird relationship, and it really hurt when I learned that she liked Matt for a long time. Guess I always had a little something for her. That was a great time up at the Doubletree last Christmas, though, I will say. Mr. A footing the entire bill, too. I guess Townes Van Zandt does have it right when he said, ""We all got holes to fill, and them holes are all that's real. "" Last night, I learned about some of Manny's holes concerning his father. He sure has been acting differently lately, though. It must be tough, but I don't know how to handle it. Maybe it's just best to let him be for a while. I kind of liked that Emily girl I met last night as well. I guess that statistic that says that men think about sex/women every 30 sec or so is right; the majority of this writing's about them. Or, maybe I just have some complex or something. Probably a combo of the two. I don't know what to think about God these days. I sure have been praying a lot to Him lately, though, over this Sue pregnancy thing. God, I hope that works out for me. I know it's selfish, but, man, You've got to understand. I truly am sorry, and I'll never have sex with another girl again on a onenighter. Lord, hear my prayer. Amen. Our society's kind of funny these days. If there is a man upstairs, I hope he's having a good time. It's amazing how fucked up stuff can get down here, though. After high school, I mean. Sometimes it's hard to be a man, and a woman I'm sure. I wonder who's got it worse. ""Sucede que me canso de ser hombre. "" It just so happens I'm tired of being a man, says Octavio Paz. I guess we all feel like that sometimes. Well, I guess my 20 minutes is up, but I do like this. Maybe we'll talk again sometime. See you, man. Take care and good luck.",0
" The statement made by Seneca, ""A great fortune is a great slavery,"" implies that wealth can become a burden and limit one's freedom. While wealth may bring financial security and comfort, it can also come with a variety of responsibilities and pressures.  One way in which wealth can become a form of slavery is through the need to maintain it. Maintaining a lavish lifestyle, managing investments, and ensuring the longevity of wealth can all become consuming tasks, taking up significant amounts of time and energy. In this sense, wealth can become a burden, limiting an individual's freedom to pursue other interests or activities.  Moreover, great fortune can also create social pressures and expectations that may be difficult to meet. It can lead to an unending cycle of material desires and the need to impress others, which can result in stress, anxiety, and even loss of privacy.  On the other hand, there are many people who have managed to maintain their wealth and still lead fulfilling lives. In some cases, wealth can provide individuals with the freedom to pursue their passions, travel, and engage in philanthropic activities. The key is finding a balance between wealth and one's personal values and priorities.  In conclusion, Seneca's statement highlights the potential dangers of great fortune. While wealth can bring many benefits, it can also lead to a loss of freedom and create additional responsibilities and pressures. It is essential to find a balance and use one's wealth wisely to avoid becoming a slave to it.   ",1

" One vegetable that is often disliked by many people is the Brussels sprout. Brussels sprouts are small, leafy green vegetables that are part of the cabbage family. They have a distinct bitter taste and a somewhat pungent smell that some people find off-putting. When overcooked, they can also become mushy and lose their texture, making them even less appealing to some people.  Despite this, Brussels sprouts are packed with nutrients such as vitamin C, fiber, and antioxidants. They are also a good source of plant-based protein and low in calories, making them a healthy addition to any diet. If you don't like the taste of Brussels sprouts, you can try roasting them with olive oil and garlic, which can bring out their natural sweetness and help balance their bitter flavor.         ",1

" On the one hand, some people argue that eliminating grades and using regular evaluations instead can create a more supportive and personalized learning environment. In this approach, teachers can give students feedback on their strengths and weaknesses, provide guidance on how to improve, and encourage them to set individual goals. This can help students focus on the learning process rather than just the outcome, and promote a growth mindset that values effort and progress over perfection.  Furthermore, the grading system is often criticized for being too subjective and arbitrary. Grades may be influenced by factors beyond the student's control, such as the teacher's biases or expectations, the difficulty of the assignment, or the performance of other students. Moreover, grades can create a culture of competition and comparison among students, where success is measured by how well one does relative to others rather than by absolute standards of excellence.  On the other hand, there are also some potential drawbacks to the elimination of grades. For example, grades can provide a clear and objective measure of a student's performance, which can be helpful for college admissions, job applications, and other contexts where standardized assessments are required. Additionally, grades can motivate some students to work harder and aim for higher achievements, which can be beneficial for their future success.  Moreover, evaluations require more time and effort from teachers, who need to provide detailed feedback on each student's work and communicate it effectively. Evaluations can also be more difficult for students and parents to understand and interpret, as they may lack a clear reference point for comparison.  In conclusion, the debate between grading and evaluations is complex and multifaceted, and there are valid arguments on both sides. Ultimately, the best approach may depend on the specific goals, values, and context of each school and classroom. However, regardless of the grading system used, it is important to prioritize learning and growth over grades and competition, and to provide students with the support and guidance they need to reach their full potential.

It is difficult making friends because I'm not used to ssing so many students in one class, and everything time i have a ifferent group of people I sit with.

It is Friday and it seems like it is the weekend, it is a bit odd because i am not in school or in class. A few minutes ago I came back from Barnes and Nobles, and I attempted to study Biology, Chemistry and alittle bit for this class but I only managed to study for Biology. Mitosis, what an interesting process. It is still boring because I know all this material from high school. I get so bored of learning the old material over and over again. However, this chapter did continue on with the enzymes and other chemical components it needed. I am so tired right now. I had a very nice sleep, maybe a little over eight hours but I am so tired. I kind of dozed off at BN, and I stopped reading. Instead I picked up a Harry Potter book I haven't been able to read and started to read it. I think I wasted more time reading that book than reading one chapter in biology. I got into that book quite quickly and I wasn't able to put it down. I started to have a headache and I got hungry. i don't have a headache anymore. Gee. it's only seven minutes and i have about thirteen minutes left. How come everytime i stop counting or timing i end at the number thirteen? thirteen hours of classes, thirteen minutes left, thirteen this and thirteen that. My goodness, I must have tons of bad luck. Or. is this my lucky number? haha, that would be very interesting. I feel quite happy right now I am still remember the events that occured last night. I can still here the the drums vibrating off the speakers and the guitars and the singers that I can barely hear. Frequency. It was pretty nice for the first one I went to. It was so humid and I felt so sticky. Gross. I dont' know what I am thinking right now. My train of thought seems to be discombobulated. I always go to one subject to the next. It seems that everyone does that, but it is weird. Even when I talk to many people, I digress off the subject. I can not believe I am typing for twenty minutes. I've done this before, but I had to hand write it out. The good thing about hand writing is that it takes a longer time and you don't have to constantly think or what you are thinking next. My eyes are feeling alittle droopy now. Should I close my eyes and type? haha. . okay I will do that. i might start falling asleep if i do this. Maybe I should open my eyes again. Okay, well, I wonder if grammar and punctuation and capitalization really matters in this writing assignment. What a coincidence. . it's been THIRTEEN minutes again. Why do I do this to myself. My hands are feeling a little numb from typing this, but my palms haven't become sweating, but my fingers feel weird. Maybe it is because of the rubber band aroiund my wrist, is must be cutting off circulation. I am thinking right now that I won't be able to quit. I just heard my brother's alarm on his watch. My brother is still in highschool, I wonder how much torture he's going through. I hated US history in highschool, and now my brother is taking it. It's not that I hated the content, I didn't like the teacher. She was so evil. The clock rang that it is three-o'clock. My AIM had shut the door telling me that someone went offline. Wow, I am still going on. three more minutes left. My neck is hurtingn and I want to quit. I think this assignment is so long. I want to take a break, but I dont' think I will be able to. i think i am typing faster than i was in the beginning. I want this writing assignment to be over now. NOW NOW NOW NOW NOW NOW! I am just babbling out. I am looking at the xperiment record sheet for psychology. Wow, five hours? YES one more minute left to do this. should I count down? I want this to be over now. I wish it was over not. why almost thirty more seconds. I am so impatient now. very impatient. VERY VERY impatient. Almost done ten more five seconds. look like it is over.",0
"My nose is really stuffy right now and I had a fever earlier today but I think it's gone now. I hate not being able to breathe. I can hear the television right now. There's a commercial about honey barbecue wings. I can also hear my room mate typing and clicking her mouse. It's really cold in my room. I'm glad I decided to put my sweater on or I would be extremely cold. I can't really smell anything because of my stuffy nose. My stomach is growling. I have a craving for pizza. Maybe I'll go get some as soon as I finish this assignment. My room mate seems to be frustrated right now. I just heard her sigh. She has a test tomorrow that she needs to study for. She is mad because we weren't able to get football tickets for the OU game in Dallas. I kind of wanted to go and was getting excited about going to it. The television just mentioned something about getting pizza. Now my craving for it is increasing. I can taste it now. It's hard to type for 20 minutes straight. The phone just started ringing and distracted my train of thought for a while. My room mate just left the room to go open the door. I can watch the television from where I am sitting in front of my computer. My room mate's brother just walked in. Now all I can think about is what he is saying and I can't arrange my thoughts now. I just gave my room mate's brother my graphing calculator and showed him how to use it. I can't think of what to type any more. I am quickly running out of ideas. Time is passing really slowly. Typing for 20 minutes is really hard. My room mate is still talking about the OU football tickets. She is getting rid of her wristband and now I am thinking how I need to take mine off too. What other homework do I have?  I don't feel like going to my calculus class tomorrow. It is the most boring class I have because all we do is work out problems. I should go to the discussion session today, but I would rather go shopping with my friend. I keep sniffing. I still wish I could breathe. I think that not being able to breathe is the most annoying thing in the world. I feel as though I want to chop off my nose just so I don't have to feel congested any longer. Is this feeling normal?  Wanting to chop off my nose?  Everytime I get congested I feel the exact same way. Now I am starting to think that there is something wrong with me for wanting to chop off my nose. Oh well, I bet it is a perfectly normal feeling when you are sick and frustrated. I wonder what caused me to become congested. I heard that a lot of people have been sick today. Maybe something is going around. I always get sick. I have the worst immune system. My stomach keeps growling, but I am not sure if I want to eat because I feel as though I shouldn't eat because I want to lose weight although all my friends say that I am crazy for feeling this way. They keep telling me that I am perfectly fine the way I am. I still don't believe them because they don't see what I see in the mirror everyday. I've been told that I have a contorted way of looking at myself and that when I look in the mirror I see something different from what everyone else sees. But isn't that true for a lot of people?  Don't a lot of people see themselves in the mirror and not like what they see?  I think that it is perfectly normal to feel this way. What isn't normal though is acting upon it. Oh well. I can still hear the television and sometimes it distracts my thoughts because I begin to pay more attention to what is on the tv rather than my own thoughts. Now I want goldfish because I just heard the commercial. I can't think of what to type again. I think that this assignment causes us to think too much about what to type and that it puts us on the spot so that we freeze up and are no longer able to type what we think because we keep trying to type interesting things and not simply what is really on our minds. My room mate just laughed. I wonder why she laughed. I can hear the people out in the hallway. These walls are really thin because I can always hear what is going on outside. The refrigerator noise is really annoying. It's so loud. I feel sick still. I just want to go lay in my bed and sleep forever. I never get enough sleep. I always end up staying up really late and then I feel dead in the morning. My foot is falling asleep as well as my hands. I have the worst circulation in the world. Why is it that my feet and hands are constantly falling asleep no matter what position I put them in. I think it has to do with the fact that I don't get the proper nutrients. My hands are starting to get tired now. I can't wait until I am finished typing. I have about 2 minutes left and actually it wasn't really that hard to type for 20 minutes consecutively. I wonder how long everyone else's writing assingments are. I bet some of them will be longer than mine because a lot of people can type faster than I can. Oh well so much for that because it's too late now to start typing faster. I could try but then it would just seem pointless. My contacts are getting dry and it's getting hard to see the screen. I hate sitting at my desk and now my arms are starting to hurt because they are in a weird position. I am almost finished now and almost time to stop. The window just appeared saying that I am finished now and I can stop typing.",0
I don't really know what I should write about. I guess I'm feeling alright. My class was cancelled for today so I had the whole day off. I rented Sling Blade which I liked the movie had people with psychological problems like the guy who is always talking about women he killed and the main character who cuts peoples heads open every once in a while if he feel s it is necessary. The keyboard on the computer sucks since the space bar key keeps on sticking whenever I try to push it down. I am kind of nervous about classes because last semester I screwed up grade wise after keeping an almost 4. 0 GPA for 2 and 1/2 semesters. I have never taken psychology before in high school and I wish I had since it would make the class easier now when I take it. I really can't type continuously for twenty minutes without having a definite subject so I keep having to stop and think of something to type. One of my goals this semester is to stop watching TV so often because that is what I feel screwed me up last semester since I was always staring at the screen either their or while surfing the web. Now I beginning to feel a little grossed out because I was just thinking about our dorm meeting where they told us housekeeping comes in only every other day to clean the bathroom when they used to come every day and it was still pretty dirty now it is going to be even worse. I guess it has been about twenty minutes now I forgot what time I started typing at since I forgot to write it down I thought I would have remembered. So I'm just going to call it a night.,0
" In general, the saying ""a little knowledge is a dangerous thing"" suggests that having a small amount of information on a subject can lead to mistakes, misunderstandings, and even dangerous consequences. While it's essential to have some knowledge on a topic, it can be harmful if we rely solely on a limited amount of information without understanding the broader context.  For example, let's consider a scenario where an individual with little knowledge about electrical wiring tries to install a new outlet without proper training. They may have read a few online tutorials or watched a video, but their limited knowledge may not be enough to ensure safe installation. As a result, they could potentially put themselves and others at risk of electrical shock or even a fire.  Similarly, in the field of medicine, a person with a little knowledge may self-diagnose and self-medicate without fully understanding the potential risks and side effects of their actions. This could lead to worsening their health condition, incorrect treatments, or even addiction.  Another example is when people rely on rumors, fake news, and misinformation as a basis for their opinions and beliefs. This limited knowledge can lead to biased, irrational, and sometimes harmful actions towards individuals or groups.  In conclusion, a little knowledge can indeed be a dangerous thing if we don't acknowledge its limitations and seek to expand our understanding beyond the superficial level. It's essential to be open-minded, seek out reliable sources, and continually educate ourselves to avoid the potential dangers of having only limited knowledge.     ",1

"I am sitting at my kitchen table right now and I am really frustrated. I am trying to write an English paper and it is so bad. I think I am so stupid sometimes. It really frustrates me when I can't do something perfect. I am also feeling kind of lonely today. I wish I was living at Hardin House because that is where all my friends live. They all seem to be making so many new friends and I just don't feel that way. I am loving college in some ways and in other ways I hate it. I really want a boyfriend. Alot of my friends have been asked to all these pledge lines and I just haven't. Am I ugly?  Am I fat?  Sometimes I just want to know what exactly in wrong with me. I am tired of drinking. Everybody in Austin is an alcoholic. It makes me feel terrible and lazy. It is fun for a while and then the next day you feel like crap. My roommates still aren't back yet from San Antonio. What's wrong?  My other roommate is getting in the shower. I wonder why. I wonder why Bobby Piper hasn't called me. He was my date a few nights ago. He was such a gentleman. I don't think we could ever date though. I am not a very good dancer. I get real nervous when I am on the dance floor. My friends from Arkansas left today. I didn't go out with them last night. I read my friends paper and she was talking about how drunk she was at the time. It kind of shocked me. It was kind of funny though. I think it gives me more self-esteem when guys like me. Is that horrible?  Diet coke is so gross. Why am I drinking one right now?  Should I call my brother?  His girlfriend is so awesome. She is one of my favorite people in the entire world. I love my brother too but he gets drunk too much. I hope he doesnt become an alcoholic. I wish people would come see me. I get kind of lonely sometimes or maybe it is that I don't want to be doing my work right now. I kind of like homework though because when I am done I get a feeling of accomplishment. That is also why I like to run. Because when I am done I get a feeling of accomplishment. I am really nervous about my English paper. I don't think it is very good. I am going to rewrite it now since I gave been rambling for twenty minutes. I need to pray. I wonder if God is always listening. Oh well, I'll stop now.",0
" Teenage smoking is a serious issue that can have lasting consequences for the health and well-being of young people. Some possible causes and problems resulting from teenage smoking are:  Causes: Teenagers may start smoking for various reasons, such as peer pressure, curiosity, imitation of family members or friends, stress relief, rebellion, or low self-esteem1. Some teenagers may also be influenced by the media, especially movies that portray smoking as cool or glamorous1 . Problems: Smoking can harm almost every organ in the body and increase the risk of many diseases, such as cancer, heart disease, lung disease, stroke, and diabetes1. Smoking can also affect the appearance, fitness, and sexual health of teenagers2. For example, smoking can cause bad breath, yellow teeth, wrinkled skin, gum disease, eye problems, reduced lung capacity, and impotence2. Moreover, smoking can lead to addiction and dependence on nicotine, which is a highly addictive substance that can be hard to quit21. Smoking can also expose teenagers to secondhand smoke, which can cause similar health problems as smoking itself3. Therefore, it is important to prevent teenage smoking and help teenagers who smoke to quit as soon as possible. Some ways to do this are:  Educating teenagers about the harmful effects of smoking and the benefits of quitting Providing support and counseling for teenagers who want to quit smoking Enforcing laws that prohibit the sale of tobacco products to minors Restricting the advertising and promotion of tobacco products  ",1
" Many parents choose not to allow their children to play with toy guns because they believe that it could encourage violent behavior and desensitize them to the consequences of gun violence. Some studies have suggested a link between exposure to violent media, including toy guns, and aggressive behavior in children.  However, other research has shown that children understand the difference between play and reality and can differentiate between real guns and toy guns. Additionally, children often engage in imaginary play that involves scenarios of good vs. evil, which can include using toy guns.  In my opinion, it's up to each individual parent to decide whether or not to allow their children to play with toy guns. If a parent is concerned about the potential effects on their child, they can choose to limit or not allow access to toy guns. It's also important for parents to talk to their children about the differences between play and real-life situations, as well as the dangers of real guns.  Ultimately, the decision should be based on the parent's personal values, beliefs, and the temperament of their child. Some children may not be interested in toy guns, while others may enjoy playing with them without displaying any negative effects.              ",1

"Actually, I am sitting here in the library, wondering how my next four years are going to be. Am I going to excel like I did in high school? or am I going to have an exceptional amount of stress that I will not be able to handle it. I don't know. this whole college thing is so new to me. I just came back from lunch with my roommate and her friends from back home. It's funny because we just had the most bizarre conversation. I just met these guys for the first time and we were talking about how and if one can tell is he or she is in love or not. It's pretty complicated if you really think about it long enough. Sometimes when you meet someone of the opposite you're attracted to them right away. But what really attracts you to that person?  Is it the way they smile? The way they simply look at you?  what is it really?  After it's obvious that the attraction is there you have to move on to the next step. Which, for some people, is the hardest part. It's the whole approaching the person thing. You want to be yourself, but then at the same time you want to do something to impress the person. so you might comb your hair a special way or wear something new. it's the excitement that you like. It's sort of like a sandwich; the bread which is the first step, you the whole chasing thing. the meat is the relationship itself with extreme ups or extreme downs. Finally, the other slice of bread is either the break up or.  It's interesting because two individuals may be in love and might not even know it. That's the neat part I think. but how do we know. I wonder if we will ever know because how do you go about finding out. what type of experiments would you do?",0
"  Field trips are an important part of the educational experience for students. They provide opportunities for learning, exploration, and fun that cannot be replicated in the classroom. Cancelling all field trips for the remainder of the year would deprive students of these benefits and negatively affect their motivation and performance. Therefore, I urge the principal to reconsider this decision and allow students to continue attending field trips.  First of all, field trips enhance the curriculum by exposing students to real-world situations and applications of what they learn in school. For example, visiting a museum can help students appreciate history and culture, while visiting a farm can help students understand biology and ecology. Field trips also allow students to interact with experts and professionals in different fields, such as scientists, artists, or journalists, who can inspire them and answer their questions. These experiences can broaden students’ horizons and spark their curiosity and interest in various subjects.  Secondly, field trips foster social and emotional skills that are essential for students’ development. By going on field trips, students can practice communication, collaboration, and problem-solving with their peers and teachers. They can also develop empathy, respect, and tolerance for people from different backgrounds and perspectives. Field trips can also help students cope with stress and anxiety by offering them a break from the routine and a chance to have fun and relax. These skills can improve students’ well-being and academic success.  Finally, field trips create memorable and meaningful moments that students will cherish for a long time. Field trips can stimulate students’ imagination and creativity by exposing them to new sights, sounds, and sensations. They can also create a sense of wonder and excitement that can motivate students to learn more and pursue their passions. Field trips can also strengthen the bond between students and teachers by allowing them to share common experiences and emotions. These moments can enrich students’ lives and make them appreciate the value of education.  In conclusion, field trips are a vital part of the educational process that should not be cancelled. They offer numerous benefits for students’ learning, growth, and happiness that cannot be replaced by any other activity. I hope the principal will reconsider this decision and allow students to continue enjoying field trips for the remainder of the year.            ",1

" However, it is essential to provide balanced and comprehensive news coverage that covers a wide range of topics, including both local and international news.  While sensational items such as local crimes and celebrity gossip may be appealing to viewers, news programs have a responsibility to inform their audience about significant national and international events. Global issues such as climate change, political unrest, and economic developments have a direct impact on people's lives, and therefore, they deserve proper coverage.  Moreover, the media plays a crucial role in shaping public opinion and promoting informed decision-making. By providing accurate and impartial coverage of national and international news, news programs can help their audience understand complex issues and make informed decisions about important topics.  Therefore, news programs should strive to strike a balance between sensational items and important national and international news. They should prioritize providing in-depth coverage of global issues that have a significant impact on people's lives, while also including local news that is relevant to their audience.   ",1
"Well, I really don't know what to talk about now. I can't really think of what I am feeling. I guess relaxed and at the same time stressed. I have so much chaos in my life now that I can't even think straight. I just moved to a new city and a new home. I joined a soroity where I am suppose to meake all new friends in 1 week or less. I have a boyfriend that is non-exsistent in my life now. I have school work that I don't even know how to work on. I am just a mess. I am going home next weekend so maybe that will calm my nerves. I was very much overwhelmed when I came here about 3 weeks ago. I wasn't ready at all for this new experience in my life. I was but I wasn't at the same time. I was so ready to leave my parents but not to be on my own all the time. I sometimes feel depressed that I have no life but in actuality I really have it the best. I am waiting for my ""boyfriend"" to come and see me tomorrow. I have been waiting for 2 weeks. Don't know how long it will last. There are a lot of guys here that are also interested. I don't know. One minute I feel upset and just want to cry and roll up and the next I just want to go out and have so much fun. I miss my parents and brother so much. My dogs are also important to me and I dearly miss them. In high school I never use to study and now I am forced to or I will fail. Which the tachers don't give a crap about if anyone fails or not. In high school they did. I have so much to get use to and I am scared to tell the truth. I don't know why this is a question because no one will read this so I won't get into a lot. I am having fun though. I have met some really cool people and I know we will be friends for a long time. My soroity has also been a big aspect in my life right now. AEPhi is the name of it. I feel comfortable there and I know I will enjoy it immensley. Well, I don't know what else to talk about. I hope everything will turn out for the better and I can realx and actually enjoy myself and everyone else.",0
" From a logical standpoint, canceling extracurricular activities to solve a litter problem may not be the most effective solution. While it is essential to encourage students to take better care of their surroundings, canceling extracurricular activities may not address the root cause of the problem. Instead, the school administration should consider implementing specific measures to promote responsible behavior among students, such as increasing the number of trash cans, holding regular clean-up drives, or educating students about the environmental impact of littering.  Furthermore, extracurricular activities play a crucial role in a student's holistic development, providing opportunities for socialization, skill-building, and creative expression. Canceling these activities may lead to negative consequences such as decreased student engagement, lower academic performance, and reduced motivation.  Instead of canceling extracurricular activities, the school administration can explore other alternatives, such as providing incentives for responsible behavior, engaging students in the problem-solving process, or partnering with local organizations to address the issue. By taking a proactive and collaborative approach, the school administration can foster a culture of responsibility and create a long-lasting solution to the litter problem.  In summary, canceling extracurricular activities may not be the most effective solution to the litter problem on campus. The school administration should consider implementing specific measures to promote responsible behavior among students and explore alternative approaches to address the issue without compromising the educational and developmental needs of the students.

I think the purpose of a sorority must be not so much to give you a place as a freshman, whichis nice and it does do, but it makes a small close world for you of very cool poeople when you are a sopjomore and a junior. I don't know how much I would want to be conected to the sorority my senior year, but just the girls and the people I had met from being a part of it. it think  it would be somewhat like cheerleading was, where by your junior and esp senior year you aren't really interested int he younger girls, and you really do your own thing. but that owould be awesome anyway because at that point hopefully I;ll be absorbed into my new life and begining a career. I have to miss the first ut football game!!I wish the zetas had a section, but maybe I can go to the tailgate party anyway if I find someone to go with, and veronica will bve here. I hope when she leaves I don't geet homesilck like I did nwhen momm and the fgirls came up. I can't believe I've really only talied to daddy once since I left san antonio. he sent me a nice letter and a nicer jchekc but too bad that a hundred dollars won;t go to o fast. being at ut in austin I dfeel like I'm in a totally different world, and I ,\can really see whant they meant about not having the time or interest to go visit other campuses. I just htought about how much fun it will be to go to aand m tosee the cross country team run, but it feels like it would take monumental organization and effort to bget up there, especially not having a car. onely four more minutesleft to type. imi liking this assignment because it reminds me of the creative writing class wiht mrs cummings nadnd how I enjoued myself in there and the free writings we would have which got easier and easier to do as the time went on, and I culd see myself more and more on the paper,and the way my thoughts went. I really like journaling but its uncomfroable to werite and I walways stop to do it late at night when I'm tired and if I do it in the morning it is eems like I get latzy and don't want to get out of bed aftereards, and I have to re read it and see all the obsesive stuff about brett wihich I am forgetting forutunately and unfortunatley. the way it isi I'm glad I don't have a boyfriend, bnot because I can run around a nd get play or do stuff with guys, but v\beecause it hink it would hadd another huge element of stresssand I really don't need that right now. I thought vivian is so gorgeous and her bf is not that cute. andni told bvern to say hi to jason for me, hut to just because I liked him and thought he was a nice guy but not because I was interested or flirting at all, or had been thin,king babout him. now the says she told him he shoul come to austin with reza, and that would be fun, but I'm thinking kind of weird too, and I don't reallywant to party with reza or old high school friends if I'm there only because of veronica and jason who lives in san antonio. I know I'll have a fun weekend because thats the only option up here, but I hope I get lots of sleep too. all done",0
"I usually don't let too many things get to me because I just want to enjoy life. I think that there are a lot of interesting and wonderful things that each person is offered in their life time and I think that it is a shame if people don't take advantage of the things that they are given. At this moment, I am happy and cheerful and I don't have anything that is bothering me. It rained today and I didn't like it, but I wasn't too upset about it because I figured that we could use the rain. It also felt cool outside so the rain really didn't bother me too much. I also have a lot of homework that I need to get done, but I think that I have handled the stress very well. Even though I have many different things to do, I have tried to pace myself and organize myself as to where I have less tension in my life. I try to organize myself based on what I think is convenient and this helps me be a more efficient person, and thus causes me to stay in a pretty good mood. During the past three weeks I have often thought about the new life that I live here at UT. It is completely different from high school, and even though it has taken a lot of adjustment on my part, I am beginning to see the benefits of college and I am beginning to enjoy myself a little more. At first I was really scared about attending college. I don't think it was anything specific about college, just the whole concept of moving away from home and being without the people that I love most in my life. But, since the beginning of school, I have been able to cope with this type of anxiety a little better and I feel that even though I have left home, I have a chance to start a whole new life here at UT. I will always be able to see the people that I love and I have accepted the fact that I will be able to see them whenever I want, and this has helped me in enjoying the college life better. There aren't very many different feelings that I usually feel in a day. For the most part, I am usually in a pretty good mood and I see myself as a fun person to be around. I try not to let the little things bother me, because I see so many people who let the small things in life ruin their entire day. My philosophy is why let one bad thing ruin all the good things that you have in life. This is why I usually try not to let too many things bother me or stress me out, it just takes all the fun out of life. I think that happiness is also a choice, people who are happy choose to be happy. They don't let too many things interfere in their lives and this helps them be happy with themselves, happy with those who are around them, and happy with the lives that they live. I choose to be happy everyday, and one of my short-term goals for each day is to end the day on a happy note. I think that it is important to end each day in a happy state of mind, otherwise your gloomy mood just carries over to the next day. When I have to evaluate my feelings, I would like to think that I am in a good mood most of the time and that people are happy to be around me. I enjoy making people's lives a little bit more fun for them. Being happy is a very important aspect of my life and I think that happiness will help me achieve my goals and it will help me lead a happy and prosperous life. I hope to be happy with myself and have others around me be happy with me as well. I think that happiness brings success in your life. I think that if one is happy, then he is successful as well.",0
"Ready, set, go. Wow, my grammar has gotten pretty bad. I wonder if this thing has, I hate these stupid pop ups, spell check. I just woke up, feel pretty worthless. Saw Pink Floyd played to the Wizard of Oz last night pretty cool probably cooler if I was stoned. Only been stoned once before, didn't like it, no desire to do it again. I'm a beer girl. Need to work out, clothes don't fit as well as they use to. Josh won't like that. I'm glad Laura is coming this weekend I hope she has fun. I really miss my family, I hope my sister can can, Fuck these pop ups, come up next weekend for Austin City Limits. I don't know where anyone went, they're probably eating lunch. Damn, 11 more minutes, I don't really know what else to write about, maybe or is maybe if I turn on some music. This is one of my favorite songs, I like it better than the original, I think it was remade for Good Will Hunting, it makes me feel so. I don't know, introspective. Bad word, but can't think of anything else. I love words, probably the only reason I did well on the SAT. Damn I'm still so tired, don't know why, must have slept for at least twelve hours. I think I might be getting sick. Spring break best vacation of my whole life, some of my favorite memories. Memories are an odd thing. I wonder why you remember the things you do. Walked into the GEO building the other day and the smell of it-deja vu-it was such an odd feeling, and I can't quite pin point what it reminded me of. I wish I knew. Deja vu is such a weird thing I knew more about it- what triggers it and everything, maybe some day.",0
"On one hand, those who support targeted searches argue that schools have a duty to maintain a safe environment for students and staff. They believe that targeted searches of lockers and backpacks are necessary to prevent violent incidents and drug use on school grounds. For example, if a student is found to be in possession of a weapon or drugs, it could potentially prevent a tragic event from occurring.  On the other hand, those who oppose targeted searches argue that they violate students' constitutional right to privacy. They believe that students have the right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures, and that school officials should not have the authority to search students without a warrant or probable cause. Additionally, opponents argue that targeted searches can be discriminatory and may disproportionately target certain students based on their race, ethnicity, or socio-economic status.  There are valid points on both sides of the argument. However, it's important to note that the Supreme Court has ruled that school officials can search students' persons and property when they have reasonable suspicion to suspect weapons or drugs. This means that school officials must have a specific reason to suspect that a student is in possession of contraband before conducting a search.  Ultimately, schools should strive to strike a balance between ensuring the safety of their students and respecting their constitutional rights. This could be achieved through clear policies and procedures regarding targeted searches, as well as ongoing education and training for school officials on how to conduct searches in a respectful and non-discriminatory manner.

"He became my good friend and we had an understanding, we connected. He left this morning. We saw him off. His mom was there so the send off wasn't so bad. The other guys are afraid to show emotion. They've got this macho, I'm afraid to feel attitude. They're smart and all but maybe not as expressive as my close friends back home. Guess that comes with time. The cheebye had to leave so damned fast. 1 week and one day's notice was all he had. And all of us, especially me, feel so betrayed. We had great plans for this summer and the fall. At least I'll be seeing him in december when I fly back home. I like stuffed toys. Beanie babies rock! but. I have to watch my spending, yeah, too many beanies'll break my bank! college isn't all that cheap. I'm not a  loaded person. I've got to think about my budget for this month. sheesh, I've  already overspent and am going to be stretched till october. cheebye!  I wonder if anybody's going to read this rambling. if somebody is, hmmmm. you can  call me. I'm ""new"" to america and don't have any american friends. sad isn;t it? but that is the case. what's the point of going overseas for an education if you  don't imerse youself into the country's culture.   oh well. I've got lot's of things to do now. like get my ""lunch"". I'm starving. hmmm.",0
"I have been typing friends and family for a while now, and I noticed today that my most creative writing is then!  When I have no worries, no cares, and just let go of all those ideas that I keep losing when it comes to the time when your dreaded English class requires a ten page paper. < and I'm wondering why this line will not stop, this page must be really long!  Wow, or the typing very small.  (Deep breath), the guy next to me just passed out onto his keyboard but- up(!) he's okay. Back to the computer idea. I believe that sometimes computers get mad at me for figuring them out, so they crap out completely. Just simply have no cure at all. The one story I want to tell is short and sweet, but a little scary. IT is the reason why I thought I'd never use a computer again, but I went against my promises, and forced myself to join this growing, technological world once again. This is really difficult. I wasn't going to write this in the LAB, but I have a large space of time between my two classes today, a four-hour space. Which is good, I do believe. I think that there are some people at the LABs who are a little too curious about what is being written on computers next to them. Ya know, ""I wonder what other people are up to?""  I admit that I've looked at a few words typed up on someone else's screen, but not as rudely as the guy who is sitting next to me. Possibly, if I tell him straight out, he'll stop, but, nope, I'm a little too shy for that. I think he'll catch on if he reads this. GET A LIFE! no, that is a little cruel. I actually have changed my mind. You can read my screen if you want.  I changed my mind after I saw the movie ""DREAM WITH THE FISHES"" very good movie. It won't be out on the screen by the time you read this I don't think. I may actually be gone by then too. I wonder. How can you stand reading -actually, I changed my mind. I'd enjoy reading people's true odd thoughts. But I like to put a visual subject to their writing, I like to know what their appearance is. I ask myself, is that wrong to want to know what that person looks like?  I really don't give a shit about what I look like once I'm out in public, but -I got off the whole point-  Some people's beliefs have to be proven by their actions, and sometimes their actions will be expressed through the appearance. These are such strong words that can honestly screw someone over; especially if they are into politics.  What the hell, I need to read back and see what I was aiming for. Oh, the guy who likes to read the screen, and the movie (!) it's time to compare and contrast. In ""Dream with the Fishes"", one of the two main characters, the one who's point of view is taken throughout the movie, he is a very simple, depressed, and desperate, business man. His favorite pastime (which the second character made him admit to him) was looking at people through his binoculars, through the city windows, across to the apartment buildings. This is a really good movie, I suggest seeing it. Okay, I'm going scatter again. Well, the second character knew all along that the business man watched him, but didn't mind. He knew that it was all the business man had, so he let him. This was not the main portion of the movie or anything, it's not that dull, it was just a simple twist to make the movie a little more unique. That brings me to another point, why must people spend so much time making movies which resemble fifty other movies?  Maybe a hundred or more?  I don't even bother to go to the ones with same plots, or no plots. But I AM a movie freak!  I might even want to get into that someday. I'll have to improve on my grammar a bit, and get used to being in the dark a lot, with fictional, or replayed stories being projected in front of me. I COULD do that. But I think my interests will take their own path, according to availability. Oh!  I just remembered that I need to get some toothpaste, and possibly some other stuff, but being a typical college student, I think I can only afford toothpaste. I HAVE noticed around here that these kids around me are very rich actually. (with a sly movement of the eyebrow)  What's up with that?  This is supposed to be real life right?  Well, another form of real life just growled at me, I'm starving, and must go. Thank you very much if you read this. You know a few secrets which I would tell no one. Well, not real individual secrets, just train of thought that I would never admit to someone else. And although you have my name, it's no matter cause I don't know who you are. See ya",0
"So I have twenty minutes to write about what I think. I was thinking of all the things I thought I would write earlier, but suddenly I'm drawing a blank. I think I'm going to stop trying to write properly because there's really no point. after all, I'm supposed to write what I'm thinking, and if I get to caught up in punctuation I don't think my thoughts will flow as naturally as they would if I was not' typing at all. nick lachey is pretty swoll, and a pretty good singer. jessica simpson can look hot, but at times she looks rather plain. there are a lot of plain looking girls here, somewhat of a disappointment. isn't college suppose to have a lot of hot girls?  o well, I have a girlfriend, so it really shouldn't matter. I remember hearing that the average male thinks about sex every 7 seconds or something like that, and it looks like I'm get to that subject pretty soon. I like timberland. he consistently makes good beats. but magoo fell off on the last single I heard from them. what's the name of that single?  I think its one and all. I turned off the music because I don't think as randomly as usually do when its on. Its like I focus on the music and that is all exists. maybe that is y I could be a good dj if I tried, but I never practice, and that's why omar's upset wit me. I hope he is doing alright now. he says he is, but I know he is still tripping, at least every now and then. man, I told him not to trip on emmi, but what he don't know is that I trip on her too. that is pretty fucked up, but I can't help it. as erin said, that girl's seductive. and she really is seductive. I wonder why. she is not THAT hot, and I see a lot of flaws when I look at her, but I still want to get with that. maybe its just lust. now that I think of it, it is mostly lust. but I would never mistreat her. well, I don't think I would mistreat her. I thought I would never cheat on my girlfriend, but look what I did in cancun. I can really trust my boys--everytime I got a dirty secret, they shut they mouth. its' not cool that I have such a big mouth. I been saying I need to work on it, and I think I'm finally getting there. now that I'm controlling this part of my personality, maybe I can control my hormones as well. but I'm 18, and everyone says they know what I mean when I tell them wussup. felix agreed with me, even hazel. life savers kickers are pretty damn good. I'm tripping, thinking bout emmi again. I don't know why I'm so infatuated wit her. but its not that strong of an infatuation. not like it was wit crystal. when I saw her at the omega talent show, I still thought she was fly. and I say she is a stuck up bitch, but I know if she honestly wanted to date I wouldn't think twice. I wish I was like those cats that know how to pull any girl. I'm starting to realize its a game, and pulling a girl is as simple as making her think you have what she wants and needs in life. I need to stop thinking bout other girls. I have a gf. just like I need to stop chatting on AIM because all it does is keep my from doing my work. I'm getting sleepy. the fire alarm went off again. I wonder if anyone actually watches the monitors that are hooked up to the cameras in the halls. well, I guess they do seeing what happened to dennis the other day. I'm getting sleepy. I wonder if I meet jaymee ong if I'd actually have the nerves to approach her. probably not, unless I was famous like her. and even then, I don't know if I would. probably if I was drunk I'd do it. hahah. I wonder if I'll have the nerves to go up to carol from alpha sigma rho. there I got thinking bout other girls again. and here I go getting sleepy. every time I take my eyes off the monitor I get sleepy        my fingers are starting to get a bit tired. this is the first assignment I've had that requires me to think about what to think about. man, chatting online never makes me sleepy, but its the exact same thing I'm doing now. sa was right. it is all in my head. if I could control every aspect of my behavior, that would work to my advantage. no more fallen asleep wen I have to read for class, or falling asleep on the road. maybe it just requires discipline not to procrastinate. but it would be cool to control the mind and have telekinesis and ESP. I think semi just sent me a text message, but I only got a minute left, so I'll wait till I'm done with this before I see what she said. I want to sing. if I could sing, I would rule the world hahaha. maybe not, but I'd feel like king. right now, that is wut I want most in life",0
"Having a winning baseball team requires a combination of factors, including skilled players, effective coaching, strong team dynamics, and good strategic planning. Here are some key elements to consider:  Talent acquisition: To build a winning baseball team, you need skilled players who can perform well in all areas of the game. This means scouting and recruiting the best players available, whether through the draft, free agency, or trades. Look for players with a track record of success and a strong work ethic.  Coaching and development: Once you have talented players on your team, it's important to have a coaching staff that can help them develop their skills and play to their full potential. This means providing individualized training and practice opportunities, as well as ongoing feedback and support.  Team dynamics: A winning baseball team needs strong team dynamics, with players who trust and support each other both on and off the field. This means fostering a positive team culture, emphasizing teamwork over individual success, and encouraging open communication and collaboration.  Strategic planning: To win in baseball, you need a well-developed game plan that takes into account the strengths and weaknesses of your team, as well as those of your opponents. This means analyzing data and statistics, scouting opposing teams, and making strategic decisions based on this information.  Mental toughness: Baseball can be a challenging and unpredictable game, and a winning team needs players who can stay focused and perform under pressure. This means developing mental toughness through mindfulness training, visualization, and other techniques that help players stay calm and focused in high-pressure situations.  By focusing on these key elements, you can build a winning baseball team that can compete at the highest levels of the sport.    ",1
"This is the first writing assignment I have had in college. I'm a little nervous. I don't know why I should be worried about this because at least this writing assignment is an interesting one. I've never written in a stream of consciousness. I just lost my train of thought. I tend to do that. Actually, I constantly go off on these tangents as I hold any conversation. It's quite annoying. But hey, it's me. It's about to rain outside. I was just telling a friend about how hilarious it was that everyone noticed that it was raining when one student left early during class yesterday. And Professor Pennebaker was totally right when he said noone was paying attention anymore to what he was saying because we were all thinking, ""How the hell am I going to get home now?"". I laughed for a long time after that, but I was still thinking about the rain. After I ran out of class I noticed a lot of people were prepared, and had their umbrellas with them. I also noticed that the people with these umbrellas who were walking with someone else without an umbrella, did not share their umbrella with the other person. Not one of them. I thought that was extremely odd. I have never used the word umbrella so many times in one sentence. I'm very sleepy now. The rain tends to have that effect on me. I love the rain, not just for that reason but it's also soothing. But I do hate when it rains right before, or when I am about to go out. It's a hassle that I haven't had to deal with for a long time. I'm thinking we are in the middle of a drought. I can't wait until winter either. That time of year makes me happy. I don't know why I keep referring to weather. I'm not one of those, ""It's lovely weather we are having today"", kind of person.",0
" I don't have personal preferences or beliefs, but I can provide some arguments based on research and expert opinions about whether reading fiction is a waste of time or not.  Reading fiction can offer a plethora of benefits, making it a valuable use of time for many people. Here are some reasons why:  It helps improve empathy: Fictional stories can help readers develop empathy by allowing them to imagine different perspectives and emotions. By reading about the experiences of characters, people can learn to understand and appreciate the experiences of others in the real world. In fact, several studies have shown that reading fiction can increase empathy and emotional intelligence.  It boosts creativity: Reading fiction can ignite the imagination and inspire creative thinking. It allows readers to immerse themselves in a different world and think about new ideas and perspectives. This can help people develop their own creative skills and generate new ideas.  It reduces stress: Fiction can serve as an escape from the stressors of everyday life. Reading can provide relaxation and help people unwind, which can be beneficial for their mental health. Studies have also shown that reading for pleasure can help reduce stress and improve well-being.  It improves cognitive function: Reading requires the brain to engage in multiple cognitive processes, such as comprehension, analysis, and interpretation. As such, reading fiction can improve brain function and cognitive skills such as critical thinking and problem-solving.  It can enhance language skills: Fictional stories can be an excellent way to learn new vocabulary and improve reading comprehension. Additionally, reading can help develop communication and writing skills by exposing people to different writing styles and techniques.  In conclusion, reading fiction can offer a multitude of benefits, making it a worthwhile and valuable use of time for many people. Whether it's for pleasure, education, or personal growth, fiction can help improve empathy, boost creativity, reduce stress, improve cognitive function, and enhance language skills. Therefore, it is not a waste of time, but rather a productive and enjoyable activity.          ",1
"I think I have one of the shortest attention spans. For some reason I can't concentrate on one thing for more than fifteen minutes. I was never diagnosed as A. D. D. though. I don't think I'm A. D. D. I just think I don't put forth the effort to concentrate. I was trying to read for English, but I couldn't keep my mind on it for anything. Every time I sat down to read I go sleepy. I try to stay focused, but it's hard. I wonder why my concentration is so limited. I think it all depends on what I'm interested in . I can read things relating to the human anatomy all day, but I have trouble focusing on things dealing with English or history. My mind often starts wondering. I've really had to adjust these first few weeks. Not only did I have to adjust academically, but socially. Even though I have a group of best friends, I still miss my friends back home. My mom, sister, and I are best fri3nds, and it's is pretty hard because I can't just pick up the phone and call them. It took a couple of day for me to realize this. I also have a boyfriend back home. This has also been hard. It's been hard for both of us. We were in the habit of talking everyday, and seeing each other quite often, now he's three hours away. I think he's taking it a little harder than I am. I'm keeping busy so I'm not constantly thinking about him. There's so much going on here. Between keeping on top of all of my classes, and hanging out, there's no more time left in the day. We've been having so much fun. The other five girls I hang out with are great. We all bonded so quickly. They really help to keep me focused on what I need to do. Of coarse with a group this big personalities flare, and we have disagreements, but surprisingly instead of holding grudges we talk it out. Females are stereotyped as being gossipy, and shady. Yes we do gossip, but if we say something behind someone's back, you can guarantee it's already been said to their face. So far everything's been going pretty smoothly. I hope this bond that is present now remains present for the next four years. It's difficult to say if it will because we can't  predict the future, and people change. When we're just sitting around we talk about our future as friends. I've already asked them to be bridesmaids at my wedding. Who knows when that will be. I don't plan for it to be any time soon, but I do hope our friendship will at least last that long. Friendship is a very important thing to me. It gives a sense of warmth, and belonging. It's like we have known each other for years. I hope nothing, but good will come out in due time.",0
" Painting a room can seem like a daunting task, but with the right tools and a bit of planning, it can be a relatively straightforward process. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to paint a room:  Prep the room: Before you start painting, remove all furniture, decor, and cover the floor with a drop cloth. Remove any electrical plates, light fixtures or cover with painter’s tape.  Clean the walls: Use a damp cloth to clean the walls and remove any dirt, dust, or grime. If there are any holes or cracks in the walls, use spackling paste and a putty knife to fill them in.  Sand the walls: If the walls are rough, use sandpaper to smooth them out. Sanding will also help the paint adhere better.  Tape off the edges: Use painter’s tape to cover any areas you don’t want to paint, such as baseboards, door frames, windowsills, and trim.  Prime the walls: If you are painting a new wall or the existing color is very different from the new paint, apply a coat of primer to the walls. Primer helps the paint adhere better and can help to cover any stains or marks on the wall.  Paint the walls: Start by cutting in the edges using a brush, then paint the walls using a roller. Work in small sections, and use a W or M pattern to ensure even coverage. Allow the paint to dry completely before applying a second coat.  Clean up: Remove the painter's tape and allow the paint to dry completely. Clean your tools and put away all the equipment. Replace the light fixtures, electrical plates, and decor.  That's it! You now have a freshly painted room. ",1
"I honestly have no earthly idea. I just woke up about 2 hours ago. Drop off my younger sister at her school, which is my old high school. My boyfriend is still a senior there. At times it is awkward going there but at the same time very comfortable. I brought my (old) teacher  a lot of buckets for the upcoming carnival for the little kids. I enjoy bringing her to school 1, because I remember how horrible bus rides were. So I never rode it. Actually I rode it 2yrs in middle school, because my mom could not drop me off. And secondly I get to see my Bert. It is weird being in a relationship, not because it is uncomfortable. More like it is a different experience. I never really had a relationship until my senior year. It really isn't hard balancing my priorities. My number one priority is finishing school. Hey, I realized that my typing isn't as bad as I thought. I still have to look at the keys at times. Back to Bert. He really is an extremely wonderful person, cute, good husband material( not that I am thinking about that right now) It's just that it really is hard to find someone genuinely nice and sincere to everyone, and especially you. I think it just sucks that he is my first true relationship. Because, the old notion that the first most likely isn't the last. Only time will tell. It's about 10:02 and I didn't go to work today. Instead, I am doing this lovely assignment. Excuse my typing, I am not that good. Oh, I know what else I am thinking. My big 18 B-Day is coming up, and my dad is still holding strict control over me. Like I am twelve all over again. He doesn't realize that I am growing up and staying home this year doesn't help. Although, I love my home and mother. I only wish certain straining attitudes would alter. My first class today is math 305G. oh, boy! My teacher is actually, pretty nice. Right now it  is much more of a review, and my homework assignment is due today also. There were only actually a few problems that I quite couldn't recall. I just have to practice on more problems. I am not at all surprised of my needed review. The problems were wonderful word problems which I have never seemed to master without practice. Well look here it is three minutes past my 20 minutes. and these people are becoming a little antsy (I think that is how you spell it) about time limits. Oh, if you actually do read any parts of these assignment  I HOPE YOU ARE READING THIS BECAUSE I JUST WAS THINKING THAT YOUR CLASS IS ACTUALLY ENJOYABLE.

"  On one hand, some elderly drivers may have health conditions or medication side effects that can impair their vision, hearing, reaction time, or judgment12. These factors can increase the risk of being involved in a crash or injuring themselves or others. Reapplying for a license could help identify and address these issues and ensure that elderly drivers are fit to drive safely.  On the other hand, many elderly drivers are still capable and responsible drivers who value their independence and mobility1. Driving helps them stay connected to their family, friends, and community. Reapplying for a license could be seen as a form of age discrimination or an unnecessary burden. Moreover, some studies suggest that elderly drivers are not more dangerous than other age groups. For example, according to the BBC, drivers aged 75 and over make up 6% of all license holders but account for just 4.3% of all deaths and serious injuries3.  I think that a possible solution could be to have a periodic assessment of driving skills for all drivers, regardless of age. This could help ensure that everyone who drives on the road meets the same standards and criteria. It could also help drivers of any age improve their driving habits and learn new techniques or technologies. This way, no one would feel singled out or discriminated against based on their age alone.  ",1
"I can't wait until tomorrow. I have only one class from 9 to 10 and then its time to go to the Matchbox 20 concert. I love Christie so much and I can't what to see her tomorrow. Christie, I hope you'll give me another chance some day. Your the best thing thats ever happened in my life. God I've changed so much this summer. I am so excited about pledgeship. I love you mom. I am going to study my rear off though to get a 4. 0. I wish I was living at Towers because Jester SUCKS. And the food is nothing special at all. I got to ask mom and dad for some cash. I really can't wait to get back to Houston to see everybody there and especially Dean, Cassie, Mrs. Smith, and of course Christie. I need to keep working out. It's doing me alot of good. Carter needs to tone it down in there so that I can finish this paper. Holy cow my mind just went blank. Oh wait a minute. 2 great looking girls are swimming over at the Theta house. I hope the Rockets win it all next year because the Bulls are really pissing me off. College is going to be tough but I think I will do just fine. I am going to be more than successful one day. I don't hope this, I know this. For the love of God. I type so slow it's not even funny. That's what I need to do is take a typing class because this is ridiculously to short and it should be much longer. Only one more minute of writing and then I'll. . . . . . Oh, what do you know. times up.",0
"I know I should probably find this sort of assignment intriguing,"" but really I'm just bored as hell. I think I can honestly say that I never imagined myself doing something like this. I guess it's something I always imagined only druggies and insomniacs did. Then again, I consider myself an insomniac. But like I said. here we are. My only motivation for doing this is that my roommate has promised me that after I finish my writing assignment, we can go to lunch. How sad. She is like my mom. She wakes me up in the mornings when I oversleep, she keeps track of my assignments for the classes we have together, she cleans the room. and even sadder. Food is my only motivation. Meh. In other news, the UT Body Project is going well. I got paid $30 for the seminar I attended yesterday. They want us to ""diet"" for the next week, though they stress that it's not ""diet[ing],"" but more ""finding a homeostasis"" in the course of our daily consumptions. Somehow I don't see that happening. On a lighter note, my new computer is totally freaking super awesome. It's great having a computer that doesn't restart every day, and actually has enough memory to complete whole tasks. My poor baby. I'm not too sure what to do with my old computer. So for now, it's sitting in a Dell box in the middle of my room, taking up space. So it's hard for me to access my closet. But oh well. Who needs clothes anyway. My roommate is sick right now. asking for tissues. This could be a disaster. She is also trying to read what I'm writing, claiming that I'm talking trash about her. . Everything she is heard is true. And, because I'm confident in the fact that no one is going to read this, and on the off chance that they do, they won't give a shit, I'll delve a little bit into my personal life. I wrote an e-mail to S (as we'll call him for now) while he was gone. Though he wasn't technically gone. He went to Harvard for college, and his computer had not yet arrived. Speaking of which, because Harvard is gay, their holiday breaks are all messed up. so they just started school, and while we get out of school on the 7th of may, they don't get out till the 25th I think. It sux0rz. Fortunately, I asked Arjun, and their spring break doesn't coincide with ours. Which means. my roommate Angela and I might go visit them up in Boston during our spring break, if there's enough money, and if we care. But I digress. Then again I guess the point of this is to digress, so by not digressing I actually am digressing. OK I'm not going to confuse myself further. Anyway. back to the e-mail. Right. So I wrote it, and he got back on Tuesday, as he said he would. But by the I'd already gotten my new computer, and installed it and everything. Unfortunately, I don't have the proper network cable to network my computers just yet, so it's still on my old POS computer. Oh well. It wasn't anything important. just a stream-of-consciousness type thing, a lot like this. Except a lot longer. I forget what the point of this story was. Oh well. I guess what I'm trying to say is that a) the Donnie Darko soundtrack is very good, and b) I miss him a lot. A lot a lot. He is going to have fun up at Harvard with his friends, while I'm stuck down here with no ability to make friends whatsoever. It's so depressing. I don't really like it down here. I miss Saikat, and Arjun, and Amit. Bah. I really need to update my journal sometime soon. I think oftentimes, I make such an effort to make the entries I write so pensive, and thought-provoking, that if I'm ever experiencing writer's block, or whatever, I just won't update. What a shame. I need to stop caring about how I write and start worrying about what I write. People don't need to read something well-written to be able to enjoy it. Then again, what's to convince myself that my entries are interesting anyway. Oh poo. In other news, the movie ""The Good Girl"" is really good. It helped me to explore some aspects of my life that I'd never given much thought to. I guess I should have.",0
"  Some of the pros of animal testing are:  Animal testing contributes to life-saving cures and treatments. Many medical breakthroughs in the last 100 years have resulted from research using animals, such as vaccines, antibiotics, cancer therapies, organ transplants, and more12. Animal testing is crucial to ensure that vaccines are safe. Especially during the 2020 global pandemic, scientists needed to test on genetically modified mice to prevent vaccine enhancement, a situation where a vaccine makes the disease worse in some people12. There is no adequate alternative to testing on a living, whole-body system. Animals are similar to humans in many ways and can provide insights into complex biological processes that cannot be replicated by cell cultures or computer models12. Some of the cons of animal testing are:  Animal testing is cruel and inhumane. Animals suffer from pain, distress, and death during experiments, and many procedures involve toxicity tests, burns, infections, mutilations, and other harmful interventions12. Animal testing is not always relevant or reliable. Animals are different from humans in many aspects, such as anatomy, physiology, genetics, and metabolism, and therefore may not produce accurate or generalizable results for human health12. Animal testing is expensive and wasteful. It costs a lot of money and resources to breed, house, feed, and experiment on animals, and many animals are killed or discarded after being used. There are also other methods available that can replace or reduce animal testing, such as human tissue cultures, artificial organs, computer simulations, and microdosing12. My personal opinion is that animal testing should be minimized as much as possible and only used when there is no other viable option. I think that animals have rights and deserve respect and compassion, and that we should not cause them unnecessary harm or suffering. I also think that animal testing is not always reliable or relevant for human health, and that we should invest more in developing alternative methods that are more ethical and efficient. However, I also acknowledge that animal testing has contributed to many important medical advances that have saved lives and improved well-being for both humans and animals. I think that animal testing should be regulated by strict laws and guidelines that ensure the welfare of animals and the validity of scientific results. I think that animal testing should be a last resort when there is a clear need and benefit for human or animal health.              ",1
"my thoughts, feelings, and sensations?  right now?  my eyes feel vacant, my heart feels heavy. at the moment?  now, in my dorm, in the silence of others and the sound only of ani's enlightening lyrics via stereo, I cannot hide behind the facade of a smile. there is no need to. unless I should be concerned with impressing a professor of some sort with a great stream of consiousness piece of writing. this is my consiousness, and I suppose it really isn't so interesting. I am worried, that is one sensation ripping through my veins. I am worried I will fail french, (how can you teach someone a new language in that language?) I don't understand. I am worried about things that cannot be voiced anywhere. I am worried about things you are not supposed to talk about. not to strangers. not to family. not to friends, unless they don't mind the burden. ""god help you if you are an ugly girl, course too pretty is also your doom"" as ani says. I know what she means; I have felt both ways, too often. I will choose the ugly girl, though. she has the better deal. she doesn't have to be afraid. I never fully understood the truth to this until I came here, to austin, to college. I didnt realize what a risk it is to be a ""pretty girl. ""  this is taking a strange turn, sorry, I havent quite figured out how to regulate my stream of consiousness. but this is what I think about. does he think I'm pretty?  god, I hope not. oh, please let someone else get in the elevator with us, don't leave me alone with him. how fast can I run if he approaches me. these are now everyday thoughts for me. I never used to be like this. I am ashamed of the girl I have become in the last week. I have discovered several things about myself since last tuesday. I am not, in any sense, the righteous babe (an ani term) I thought I was. I am a scared little girl. I cannot stand up to those who hurt me; I have proven that this week. in lieu of retaliation and justice, I cower in the shadows, I cling to my boyfriend, I cry myself to sleep. my mind is full of thoughts, so many I can't sort them all. so only the prominant ones come through to the screen. I apologize that they can't be the happy ones, the ones that say how much I love college, life, and my psychology class. I am not worthy of so many things, I think maybe my hypothalamus doesn't secrete enough of that happy stuff. my feelings are not so great at the moment; perhaps I should have chosen to write this some other time. I am so naive and stupid. those are my thoughts. that I allowed this horror to happen to me, to my boyfriend; that I am doing nothing about it. that I am writing about it here for someone I have never spoken to to read it. I miss my little brother. my baby four year old brother. he is my favorite person in the entire world. I am looking at a picture of him now, holding a wooden sword, pretending to be either david crockett or obi wan kenobi. welp, my twenty minutes are up. thank you, doctor.",0
"All I can really think about is how incredibly tired I am. My sleeping schedule has been severely altered. I stay up until 1:00 or 2:00 every night studying, then to get up at 7:00 or so to go to class. Surprisingly going back to the discussion in class, I am not especially stressed although I never seem to be. The only thing I ever stress about in Jason, Mandi, and some of my other troubled friends. Jason really is the source of all my stress right now (little as it is). I worry about him all the time. Not that I don't think he can take care of himself, because he is incredibly independent. I just think that maybe if I worry about it, it will do some good. There's my logic as usual it's very skewed. I am so incredibly tired. I can't help but think that if anyone reads this, they must be thinking that I lead the most unproductive life at UT. This really isn't the case. I just tend to sleep during the day, leaving all my studying to be done at night, and then stay up late doing that it's a vicious cycle of, well, laziness I suppose not necessarily unproductive. People can be lazy and still manage to be productive; there is a difference. This difference is vaguely present in my mind, and in my state of complete exhaustion, I am not capable of articulating it. I can't even make a coherent sentence describing my inability to articulate. I have Biology in an hourI don't want to go, but I know I will. I haven't developed that skill that comes to every college student. The one where you can miss class, and not panic, or feel remotely guilty for wasting your parents' money. I suppose this is a good thing though. I am staring at the foam brain resting on my computer speaker. There is something strangely humorous about it again; I can't even begin to articulate what it is. Just a foamy brain, portables, small, and somehow humorous. My sense of humor is rather odd. I have gathered this from several sources: the fact that Monty Python is the greatest series ever made, the fact that foam brains are hilarious, and the fact that I can laugh at anything without having any real reason. Random laughter. It's good in some ways. This doesn't look like twenty minutes of writing, but I suppose that if I have been typing for twenty minutes, then this is twenty minutes worth of writing. I am so smart I amaze others and myself.",0
"This week has been so overwhelming!  I have taken in so much and my mind feels like it is in overdrive. I already feel stress and the semester has barely begun. I want to be involved in a many ways as I possibly can, but there are so many organizations to join, I don't know what to choose. The difference between college and high school is readily apparent. I hope as time goes by, I will develop better study habits and get used to waking up early. I am extremely nervous about the first exam in all of my classes because I do not know what kind of questions the professor will ask, and therefore, do not know how to prepare for them. Tonight I am glad that I get to go out and do something because I feel so couped up here in this dorm room studying all week. I am also excited about seeing my boyfriend and cousins this weekend. Everytime he calls, I light up with happiness. No matter what kind of day I am having, I always feel better when he calls. I still miss my ex very much though. Two years is hard to let go of especially when they have been your friend for an even longer period of time. I wish he would just call me because I really want to talk to him. We used to talk every night for hours and hours. He was such a big part of my life and now I barely see him, let alone talk to him. I think that he is mad at me because I am dating someone else, but I'm not sure. He usually returns my calls, but I have not talked to him in like 4 days. I am really hungry and I would love a big bowl of icecream. but I can't have one. I am really trying to stick to this stupid diet because of all of the ""freshman 15"" horror stories. I wish I had more time to take a nap during the day, but when I'm not studying, I'm working out or running errands. Another thing I'm worried about is having two finals on one day. My mythology and calculus finals are right after one another and they are both very demanding courses. Oh well, I guess I just have to make the best of it because there is nothing I can do about it. Thank god I don't have three on the same day--then, I would really panic. I'm thankful to have Julio because he really pushes me and encourages me when  I am doubtful or discouraged. I miss him so much more than I thought I would. I have only been with him for a month, but I already feel attached. I hope my parents like him when they meet him this weekend. Hes so smart and has good manners. Their approval means a lot to me and I guess Ill find out what they think of Julio this weekend",0
"I am sitting in my dorm room listening to my roomate talk on the phone to her boyfriend. I have just finished studying and everything i have just read is all jumbled in my head. I am thinking about the weekend and what I am going to do because my roomate's sister is coming to stay with us. She is a junior and has just come out and said that she is depressed. I want to take her out and make sure she has a good time. However, I went to my chapter meeting tonight and they told us that this weekend we were having out pledge retreat and a field day on Saturday. I have so much to study for and so much reading and I have to entertain a 16 year old girl. I don't know how I am going to get everything done. But I know that everything will work our because it always does. I am listening to little pieces of information about my roomates conversation and am very curious as to what is going on. It sounds very interesting. I am just thinking about everything that I need to do and all of the people I need to talk to. It is so difficult when you have to talk to all of your friends from your hometown and talk to your mother while trying to go to class, meetings, and everything else. It seems there are never enough hours in the day. My roomate is offering our room to a couple of her friends to come stay at our dorm this weekend. The girls are extremely annoying and I think I will have to find somewhere to stay. Hopefully our retreat is overnight. It has been alright with my roomate and I. He were best friends in Elementary school but things do change. I came in the other night and she was drunk and was trying on my clothes. It pissed me off but I can't say anything just because she is too nice. She left this weekend and went to San Antonio and stayed with her boyfriend. They got a hotel room for the night. It was nice having the room all to myself. I have my entire schedule with a boy who I went to high school with. I was shocked at first but now it is very helpful. We can tell each other and remind each other about assignments and other things. I went to my FIG class today and felt like I was back in the fifth grade. He assigned us a project where we have to create a shield. The usual what you like, a word that describes you, and other stuff to that nature. I finally talked to my ex-boyfriend today for the first time in a couple of weeks. We broke up because we were going to different colleges and he couldn't handle it. He is too much of a guy. Everyone went home this weekend in my dorm and I was all alone. Our room smells like chinese food because we can't take our trash out until Thursday so until then it stinks. I still have not done an laundry yet because out dorn is out of special laundry cards. I need to go to the grocery store to buy more folders and drinks. I will probably leave and go with a girl who lives down my hall. I am excited that I don't have class tomorrow until 2:00. We have a Theta mexican lunch tomorrow that I am taking my best friend to. Everyone in my pledge class is so caught up with Jenna Bush. I almost think people joined it because she is in it. She is just like every other girl in that room with the exception that her father is the President of the United States. At our meeting tonight the Secret Service was there. That part if kind of cool to see them. It gives you a sense of security that you are protected as well. All of the girl in my pledge class are really nice. I met the sweetest girl down my hall. I am going to her Grandmother's 75th birthday party in a couple of weeks somewhere near Dallas with her. My computer keeps messing us and the pointer is going to the middle of the page. My suitemate just made popcorn and is offering it to us. It smells incredible.",0
" Outdoor living is a lifestyle that involves spending more time outside in natural settings, such as gardens, patios, porches, pools, decks or balconies. It can also include activities like cooking, dining, entertaining, relaxing or gardening outdoors. Outdoor living can provide many benefits, such as improving your mood, health, social life and connection with nature1.  Some examples of outdoor living are:  Having an outdoor kitchen with a grill, prep station, countertop and mini fridge1. Enjoying a fire pit or a hot tub on cooler nights1. Creating a cozy cottage garden with rustic walkways and colorful flowers2. Installing a pergola or a gazebo for shade and privacy1. Adding a water feature or a fountain for soothing sounds and ambiance1. If you have an apartment in the city, you can still enjoy outdoor living by creating a small balcony garden with potted plants, herbs, hanging baskets or vertical planters. You can also add some outdoor furniture, such as a bistro table, chairs, cushions or a hammock. You can use solar lights, candles or lanterns to create a cozy atmosphere at night. You can also join a community garden or a park nearby to grow your own vegetables or flowers and meet other people who share your interest in outdoor living           ",1
Today was a tough day for me. I can't believed I failed to talk to  Asweenee. No girl has ever had that much power on me. Its probably the sun kicking in. I can't wait to go to the football game on Saturday. UT  is definitely going to beat Rutgers b/c Rutgers lost last week to a weak team by more than 20 points. Calculus class is going to be boring tomorrow because the professor is going to continue his lecture on limits. I hope we get no homework or else I will be very busy Wed. night. That phone next door is driving me crazy! Why does Kyle have the ringer on so high? I need to buy the Bush CD soon. The songs on that CD will pump me up and let me overcome my fear of talking to Asweenee. I hope she remembers me from the concert and knows that I am not some weird freak. Neal seems to enjoy studying Chemistry for no reason because he does the extra problems even though they are not due at all. I guess he feels insecure about his ability in Chemistry. I hope the Giants win next week at Jacksonville. It should be a good game but knowing my luck they won't even televise that game. Who cares about the Cowboys?  Tonight I want to email Steve and tell him my difficult conquest for a girlfriend. Maybe things will clear up the next few days and I will finally have the courage to do what I am so good at: socializing. I have never froze up like this in a long time. Maybe I am thinking too much about screwing up. I know I am better than that. Baseball season is almost near the homestretch. I hope the Yankees can catch up to the Orioles and go back to the World Series. My parents are probably trying to call right now and are wondering why the phone line is busy. I wondering how Linh is adjusting at Rice?  I hope she is not getting too depressed about not seeing Paul because I am not there to help her get through this hard time. I am glad I was there for her this summer because she needed a good friend who could understand her. I really miss her a lot but at the same time I know she will be fine. I sound like her parents. I wonder how Craig's drive to Minnesota is?  His dad is probably giving him a lecture after what happened to him this summer. This room needs more AC. AC. The idiot next door is blaring his music. Spice girls suck!  If he is going to listen to music at least show some taste. I think I am starting to feel the effects of the Hunan chicken. That stuffed dog looks like Snoopy. Neal must be attached to this toy.,0
"It is quiet in my room, Josh is asleep and all I hear is the fountain that I bought at Sam's gurgling and trickling in the background I wonder if it will ever break, no it probably won't because it has a one year warranty the room is cold all of the day except for right now when it is hot outside and warm in here why doesn't the school let us have our own a/c units it is a pretty neat school though, I can't wait until I see my girlfriend, it kinda makes then end of the week have some meaning to me for a change, I don't think I talk that much on the phone, I think it's more like ahh I really don't know, but it's not that much when I type, the fountain's sound kinda melts into the background, and I almost forget that it's there, and then when I stop it comes back again, I guess my mind focuses on the clicking of the keys, and once they stop, then it tunes in to aural noise it's only been 8 minutes and I feel like I've been typing for a really long time, I wonder if the kids who were putting up a fit about having to use the computers for this assignment are actually going to do it, my mom's that way about computers, it's not so hard to get a hang of, besides, it beats writing on paper for sure I think I need some more paper for the printer and then a new computer and a guitar I hope I win the lottery so I can buy the computer and the guitar, I think I can swing the paper, though man, they weren't kidding about poor college kids, I never thought I would actually be subsisting on 6 hours of sleep and  those damn Ramen noodle cups that I'm sure are poisoning me even as I speak or rather type, but at least they aren't as poisonous as Jester food I think there was some human in that burger I just ate, my stomach knows for sure what it ate, but I just can't figure out what it is maybe I should order Chinese food and hope fully there won't be real Chinese people in it because that would probably upset my stomach too I really don't like people who eat people but I dislike people who eat tarantulas even more, that was so gross seeing them on the sticks at the natives roasted them over the fire actually, I like the Discovery channel quite a bit, it sure beats the dumb talk show about love triangles between a man and two dogs of different sexes that type of stuff pollutes the airwaves much like a sort of flying landfill I wonder where all the trash is going to go in the near future, I think they should make the criminals eat it or recycle as much of it as they can I think my room puts out more coke cans than the entire state of Texas but at least we recycle them back home I get money for doing it but here I just get sticky fingers and a desire to drink another coke I wonder if you could put a pool table in here, that would be cool and so would a tiger, I always wanted a tiger, one of those black and white bengals but I would have to get it fixed and declawed and maybe dull it's teeth or something I think if I had one then nobody would complain because it is a tiger after all, and I could say sic-em and the tiger would bite off their heads or something now I really wand a tiger, but I would settle for some neons in my fish tank, I wonder where they are sold. . . .",0
"Today I got a new washer and dryer. I know this is kind of corny to write about, but I am so excited. I won't have to use the laundry room for the apartment complex anymore, because now ì have my own washer and dryer. It cost one dollar to wash and one dollar to dry, in the wash room. My clothes didn't event come out dry. I was so pissed. I am very very thankful for my parents. I would not have this BRANDNEW washer and dryer if it were not for them. God has truly blessed us as a family. My family is a strong, close family. They are always there for me and my sisters no matter what happens. Right now my nieces and nephew ar living with my mom and dad. My sisters are in the Navy,so their children stay with my parents. My mom loves it, but I know it is very hard on her. It is hard on me when I go home to visit. I never get any rest. I am always up around 7:00 in the morning. Someone is always crying at one time or another. Especially Zac, he cries around three in the morning when everyone is asleep. I love going home, but man I get so happy when it is time for me to com back to Austin. This typing thing is going by pretty slow. I swear I have been on here for ten minutes already. I don't even know what else to type about. I could type about my ex-fiance, that would take more than twenty minutes. I am still paying for my foolishness behind him. We were together for a long time, then he proposed. yeah, that same old traditional, only the right way to go kind of things. Anyway, we were together for a long time, about 2 yrs. He proposed in front of my whole family on Dec. 23, which happened to be the day my family celebrated Christmas that yeat. I cried, I said yes . Then all of the drama started, he wanted ot hang out with his friends all of the time , and I just got tired of all of the foolishness. I guess he got tired of all of it too. SO, he broke up with me. I cired for a little while, but my mom helped me out a lot. She told me,   Every woman has her heart broken at least one time, and baby this is your time  . I didn't want to believe it but it was true. I faced the facts, picked up my heart and moved on. It's not time yet!!!!!!!!!!!!! Ghosh the insanity. I guess I will type really slow so time will go by really fast. I never knew twenty minutes would take this long. Time flys by when you're having fun. I guess this is not one of those times. I'm almost there though. I wonder what everyone else wrote about. You know, I feel like I'm talking to myself or some kind of imaginary friend. This seems so funny. Well I guess I'll take these last few minutes to say my goodbyes. I'm just playing, wasn't that funny. No, I didn't think so either. It's only 9:57, I thought it was eleven o'clock. I did that eleven o'clock to waste time. TWO MORE MINUTES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I can almost see the light at the end of the tunnel. It's so delightful. I guess my fingers needed the workout. Poor fingers. Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm what to  do, what to do . 10, 9, 8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1,",0
"Will I survive? That is what I am thinking about right now. I am here because someone gave me money to live in this dorm, go to classes, and actually learn about something that will be of value to my self and my community. Pressure. Everyone is depending on you. focus, is what I need ot keep sstudying and do homework every night. there is Spanish, Math which I already should know because I took calculus and made an A except I didnt remember a thing. I slacked off my senior year and abondoned my whole work ehtic. Sad, for me, because staring over is a pain. How ami going to make my lazy but become dedicated to my sutdies again? I am still dizzy from my long 11 hour nap. I want to shut out the world and just go to sleep, but that is too easy. How will I survive, how will I support my family? No, I wont sleep. I will finish this writing assignment. Then finish my pre-clculus, aftter that Spanish, then I will read my psychology book. My wrists are starting  to hurt a little. I have not typed in such a while. it feelslike theyre going to go stiff on me like the way they do when I'm doing curls and I can't make another rep. Today is chest day. I have tofollow this new workout program called periodization. I'm kind of hesitant because it seems like I will be losing some of my hard gain that I have achieved. Gregory gym sucks. Its always so crowded so how am I supposed to get a good waorkout? on the other hand the female persuasion is very represented. But that si also a distraction. Boy I have 160 dollars to live on for the next 2 months and I am worried that I might starve or something. I hate being hungry. it is the worst feeling ever. I could never be homeless. It is too hot inTexas to be abeggar. Iwould haveto move to Ohio or somewhere cooler. poor homeless people! Well my back is starting to hurt on my right side. I think it is because of the way that I slept. since I've been here all I do is listen to music that I slisstened to back home.",0
"September 4, 1997      Well, here I go beginning my stream of consciousness. I really don't know  why I put the date up at top, just that I do that with everything, apologize if it offends you. Right now I am freaking out on my foot, which is almost killing me today. I swear I think I have the largest foot blister ever created currently on my foot and its not fun because I can't run, jog and it even hurts to walk on the thing. I have trouble putting on socks because the blasted  thing hurts so bad. I'm really beginning to wonder what I did to deserve that, I really don't think I've messed anyone up really bad lately. I've actually been kinda nice lately, which I usually am. Well, I guess nice unless you  consider what I did on Monday night. You see, some people keep calling up our dorm room and asking if its the Perry Castaneda library. I had been telling  them that it wasn't until I got sick of it. So some girl called on Monday and asked how long we were open. I told her we'd be open until 12:00 midnight  and that if she hurried she could catch us before we closed. I guess it was  kinda mean but I also thought it was really funny. Well, my hands are already starting to hurt me and that's not good because I have about fourteen minutes left. anyway, I'm starting to get hungry now but I still have more work to do so I figure I'll leave after I'm done with it all, which will take forever. Oooh, look at her, I guess I'm definitely going to have to move after I'm done here. Oh, by the way, I'm in the SMF at the library so I can be easily distracted while I'm doing this. I must confess I do that quite a bit, like the girl sitting next to me in class today, of course, I did listen to the lecture, but it was still kind of a distraction. Anyway, wondering what to type now to let you know  what's going on in my sick little head. Hey, you ever hear why ice is no longer  available at the Texas A&M cafeteria?     The senior who knew the recipe graduated. I have alot of questions like that. For instance, if you throw a cat out a window, does it become kitty litter?  If olive oil is made of olives,  what is  baby oil made of?    Why is abbreviation such a long word?   Why do they put Braille on ATM machines?  Speaking of blind, what about those signs that say, ""No Eye Seeing Dogs. ""  I mean, who's that sign for?  The blind man or the dog? At the special Olympics, do they have reserved spots for non-handicapped persons? How does the guy who drives the snow plow get to work?   Why do they sterilize needles for lethal injections?  Does a radioactive cat have 18 lives?  If you shoot a mime, should you use a silencer?   If Styrofoam packs everything, what do they pack Styrofoam in?  Why is it that you drive on Parkways and park on  driveways?  If nothing sticks to Teflon, how do they get Teflon to stick on the  pan?   If Alsups is open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year, why are there locks on the door?  Why is it that whenever you transport something by ship,  its called cargo and when you transport it by car, its called a shipment?  Why do they call it taking a dump when you're actually leaving something?  Anyway, those are the crazy things that go through my mind. Hopefully, I won't be classified as a loony and become subjected to further tests or something. Until next time.",0
"  Dear [Television Network],  I am writing to express my deep disappointment upon hearing the news that my favorite television show will no longer be airing on your network. As a loyal viewer, I am urging you to reconsider your decision to cancel the show and continue airing it for its dedicated fan base.  The show has brought so much joy and entertainment to me and many others who tune in every week to see the latest episodes. It has become a staple in our lives, providing us with a sense of comfort and familiarity. The characters have become like friends to us, and we look forward to following their stories each week.  Furthermore, the show has been consistently praised by both critics and audiences alike for its quality writing, compelling storylines, and talented cast. It has been a rare gem in a sea of reality TV shows and mindless sitcoms. Cancelling the show would not only disappoint the fans, but it would also be a disservice to the talented individuals who have worked hard to create this masterpiece.  I understand that ratings and financial considerations may have played a role in the decision to cancel the show. However, I implore you to reconsider and look at the bigger picture. The show has a dedicated fan base, and cancelling it would not only upset them but could also lead to a loss of viewership and revenue for your network.  In conclusion, I respectfully request that you reconsider your decision to cancel the show and continue airing it for its dedicated fan base. Thank you for your time and consideration.    ",1
"Ok. I'm here in the CPE building during mandatory study time. I'm trying to catch up on some missed work, like this stream of consciousness writing exercise which I couldn't do before hand because I lost my class code number.   Well. Anyway, let's see what's on my mind. The Mets are really bad. I've actually begun rooting against them so they'll fall into last place and Art Howe will be fired. He really is an Awful manager. Personally, I liked Bobby Valentine. Sure he had a couple rough moments, but overall he was a much more effective manager. Hmmm. well. my friend Scott Neff, who used to work for the mets, sat down with Jim Duquette the other day and JD pretty much vented all of his anger about this season and his distaste for Art Howe. They've begun to give him nicknames in the clubhouse. For example: The Wizard, The Wiz, and The Grandfather. There was a little bit of a pause there because I took a swig of water. I'm pretty sure the guy behind me is looking at what I'm writing. Is that a little bit disconcerting. Yes. Oh well. I'm glad I will be taking advantage of this time. 3 hrs of studying a night can really keep you on track. I just turned my cell phone off. James has handwriting that's hard to understand. My battery life remains surprisingly high. Wireless internet is pretty awesome. Wow. This is the first time I've used wireless internet. I wonder how long I've been typing? Probably 8 or 9 minutes which means that I should probably stop around 8:56. I wonder what I'm going to have to do after 11 pm. I should have brought those quarters. I knew I should have. But then I would have been late. I've got this compulsion for grammatical correctness. Is that weird? Well, I talked to my mom today. She and my dad took the top down in the convertible for the first time today. That's sick. My dads had that car since before I left for school. That's over a month now and he hasn't even taken the roof down!!! He spent 70 grand almost on a convertible and doesn't even bother to take the roof down! tell me that's not a disgusting waste. Someone came in and asked for the sign in sheet. I wonder how the ghs theater stuff is going. I thought Id miss it a little bit. And I kind of do. I miss the actual acting aspect of it. But you can't imagine the relief of not having to deal with kohn at all. It should be pretty cool to come back home though and visit. It must be all the more liberating to view that whole situation from the outside. Or maybe it will just bring back weird memories. My finger. No my thumb really itches. I'm thinking I should wash my hands. They feel pretty grimy. I did wash them after I ate that sushi though. The sushi was surprisingly good. On the other hand it should be good if its $8. The smell in the room. Well there is no distinguishable smell. Back in jester though. WOW. That place smells incredibly bad. It's always a mixture of body odor, popcorn and some sort of Lysol. Really nasty. I wonder how Lauren is doing? I really like that girl, but lately my attraction to her is more as a friend. Sexually, she is pretty frustrating. I assume all Mormons are. But when I have numerous girls around me who are much more. um. Liberal sexually, it makes me think twice more often than I'd like. I wonder what she thinks of me. That situation with Tyler is fu. Messed up. I'm sure she knows that. But now that I think of it. That whole thing is pretty messed up. OH well. Someone came in the room and kindly asked us to be quiet. He's walking over to someone. Whispering in his ear. Smiling. Oh well. I think my battery life is running low. I think my 20 mins is up.",0
