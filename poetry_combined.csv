"Sound, oh sound, how sweet thy tune
A melody that fills the room
A symphony of pitch and tone
A journey for the ears alone

From the softest whispers to the loudest cries
To the laughter of children and the lovers' sighs
It carries messages both small and grand
A language we all understand

It can soothe the soul and calm the mind
A balm to heal the hurting kind
It can uplift and inspire us all
And make our spirits rise and fall

It's the music of nature, of wind and waves
The rustling of leaves, and rain in caves
It's the tapping of feet, and clapping of hands
A rainbow of sound that never ends

Sound, oh sound, how it enriches life
The perfect symphony, free from strife
A gift that we must cherish and protect
A treasure whose value we cannot neglect.",1
"In the secular night you wander around
alone in your house. It’s two-thirty.
Everyone has deserted you,
or this is your story;
you remember it from being sixteen,
when the others were out somewhere, having a good time,
or so you suspected,
and you had to baby-sit.
You took a large scoop of vanilla ice-cream
and filled up the glass with grapejuice
and ginger ale, and put on Glenn Miller
with his big-band sound,
and lit a cigarette and blew the smoke up the chimney,
and cried for a while because you were not dancing,
and then danced, by yourself, your mouth circled with purple.
Now, forty years later, things have changed,
and it’s baby lima beans.
It’s necessary to reserve a secret vice.
This is what comes from forgetting to eat
at the stated mealtimes. You simmer them carefully,
drain, add cream and pepper,
and amble up and down the stairs,
scooping them up with your fingers right out of the bowl,
talking to yourself out loud.
You’d be surprised if you got an answer,
but that part will come later.
There is so much silence between the words,
you say. You say, The sensed absence
of God and the sensed presence
amount to much the same thing,
only in reverse.
You say, I have too much white clothing.
You start to hum.
Several hundred years ago
this could have been mysticism
or heresy. It isn’t now.
Outside there are sirens.
Someone’s been run over.
The century grinds on.",0
"Dreams - a world beyond our own  
A place where possibilities are grown  
A realm where imagination roams so free  
And we can be whoever we want to be  
  
In dreams, we can soar through the sky  
Or swim with dolphins, way up high  
We can talk to lions or fly with birds  
And roam through vast lands, without any words  
  
Our dreams can be sweet, or they can be strange  
And leave us feelings that we can't derange  
They can inspire, or fill us with fear  
And leave us longing, for when they reappear  
  
But what makes dreams so magical and true  
Is that they're reflections of what we pursue  
They show us our passions, our yearning desires  
And ignite our souls like smoldering fires  
  
So embrace the dreams that come to you at night  
For they're a gift, like a glimmer of light  
And they'll take you on journeys, you've never seen  
To a world that's forever, wild and serene.",1
"Sight, oh sight,
What a precious gift besides light.
A stunning world to behold,
A treasure trove of colors and stories untold.

With sight, we witness nature's glory,
The sunrise, the sunset, and all its mystery.
The stars twinkling in the night sky,
And the clouds that paint on high.

Through sight, we can read and learn,
Books and knowledge, to our brain it returns.
We can gaze at art with awe and wonder,
And see the beauty of human culture.

Sight connects us with other souls,
The sparkle in a lover's eye, it unfolds.
The tenderness of a child's smile,
And the happiness that is worth the while.

Without sight, the world would be dark and grey,
Silhouettes of things, apart from the day.
But with sight, we get to live a life,
A precious gift, that helps us thrive.",1
"Yes, I wanted them to levitate.
Unfortunately, I hadn't a leg to stand on.
Cut-out camels plodded across the blackboard's high
sill. Yet the desert below refused to unfurl its
mica wings. When I asked them to try to remember,
to release a soap bubble from their marvelous arsenal
of wands, they resisted. They lined up, suspicious
in individual spotlights. The fountain inside
the scissored palm could only rise so high,
maybe just a trumpeted C. Which is high, but
not like those huge blue dreams that used to float by,
shot from cloud-atomizers, the original public breeze
on its back in the grass. Let's try to guess who
or what is being borne up by this caravan of thin-
skinned humps, a-bulge, inoculated? I tell you
every one has a rider, a crop. It's been done
this way for some time. If we pause here by the pillars
of sand, up to our poet-knees in anarchy, won't each
gulp of hoarded water from the toppled monument be
sweeter passed hand to hand in the sun-colored dipper?
Up to our thighs in it now, and spared what drills it-
self into the rock daily, so it can claim to know zero
after zero, and make that nothing into a sound like
silent bells, split parched hooves, plodding.",0
"The scent of pig is faint tonight
as the lime trees hang their heads against gradations of blue,
looking at the lone suitcase in the middle of the farmyard
with a sense of solidarity. Also forgotten.
Its owner never once looked up at them and exclaimedI was still soft-fingered when I planted you.
In the plane, her gaze rests on a flock of cloud-birds,
pinkish purple with elongated necks, rests
on the plane’s wing-tip colored pink by the sun.
Her head is heavy with this childhood cargo,
like the hawk that usually flies between or above their branches,
found skimming the ground with its catch of mouse or mole,
or the barge that passes every day at four, its metal nose
just out of the water, while empty at eight, its sleek sides
flash signals to those on shore. Later, on the highway
a row of trucks lit like orange squares in the setting sun—
a colony of ants each with a piece of chrysanthemum
on their backs—begins to reassemble memories;
the petals become lining, the shape of the flower is lost,
so that years later, looking at an old photograph,
she will not remember the names of cousins and uncles
but the exact bend in the river behind them, the pattern of trees.",0
"Gentle, delicate, a lover's caress,
Intimate moments, nothing can express,
Electric sparks that light up the skin,
A touch that makes your heart begin.

Fingers tracing through hair so fine,
Every touch sends shivers down the spine,
Whispers of love that lull to sleep,
Caressing arms, ever soft and deep.

Tender kisses, a trail down the neck,
A touch so light it leaves just a speck,
The skin alive with every sensation,
A moment shared, the ultimate temptation.

Touch, a language that speaks so much,
A connection that fills the heart's clutch,
In your arms, I feel at home,
A touch that never leaves me alone.",1
"Blue, the color of the sea,  
Reflecting peace and tranquility.  
It's the hue of the sky, so vast and free,  
A sight that fills the soul with glee.  
 
Blue, the color of the ocean,  
The coolness and calmness it emotes.  
It's the shade of peace and devotion,  
That in our hearts forever floats.  
 
Blue, the color of harmony,  
The blissful calmness it conveys.  
It's the color of serenity,  
That makes our spirits bright and gay.  
 
The color of strength and loyalty,  
It fills our hearts with purity.  
It brightens up our every day,  
And fills our souls with harmony.  
 
Blue, the color of the world,  
The color that calms and soothes.  
It soothes the mind and the soul,  
And makes our hearts smooth.",1
"I detest the bug that crawls and creeps,
Its presence in my home, I cannot keep.
It scurries along the wall and floor,
Making me shudder and want to roar.

Its six legs move in unison,
A sight that fills me with revulsion.
The way it moves leaves me unsettled,
I wish it would just retreat, be fettled.

Its antenna wave in the air,
As if searching for something to ensnare.
I can't help but feel so anxious,
As if it's watching and waiting, devious.

Its body is slimy and small,
I want it gone once and for all.
But no matter how much I try,
It seems to always find a way by.

Oh, how I hate that creepy bug,
May it scuttle away, be gone, and clear out all the grunge.",1
"Innocent giggles and playful screams,
Inquisitive eyes and endless dreams,
A world of wonder in every sight,
Childhood memories, forever bright.

Skipping ropes and hopscotch squares,
Barefoot adventures and no worldly cares,
Endless summers, never-ending fun,
Lost in the moment, under the sun.

Sweet scents of freshly baked pies,
Warm hugs and lullabies,
Magical tales before bedtime,
Visions of fairies and dragons to find.

Building forts, climbing trees,
Feeling free with the gentle breeze,
Friends at our side, happy and gay,
Childhood moments that never fade away.

Laughter that echoes, memories that last,
Innocent moments that go by so fast,
A time of wonder, joy, and play,
Childhood, where our hearts can truly stay.",1

"Whispers of the Ocean's Song

The waves, they crash against the shore
Their melody, a haunting score
A constant rhythm, ebb and flow
A song the ocean does bestow

Whispers of the ocean's song
Echo in the breeze, all day long
A symphony of sound and light
A peaceful, soothing lullaby

The salty air, it fills my lungs
I close my eyes and softly hum
The ocean's song, it brings me peace
A sense of calm that will not cease

Whispers of the ocean's song
A gift to all who come along
A reminder of the beauty here
Its wonder, nothing can compare

So listen close, and you will hear
The whispers of the ocean's song so clear
A symphony of sound and peace
A harmony that will never cease.",1
"Faith is like a light that guides our way,
A pillar strong that helps us stay.
When the road is dark and bleak,
It is faith that we must seek.

It's the belief in something bigger,
Something that makes our heart trigger.
A force that can help us climb,
Over the mountains, standing high.

Faith is the wind beneath our wings,
The trust that makes us believe in things.
Hope in the midst of despair,
The promise of a better air.

It's the deepest part of our soul,
The mark that makes us whole.
A connection to the divine,
A power that makes us shine.

Faith is what keeps us going,
A light that keeps on glowing.
It's the spark that sets us free,
In the journey that we must be.

So hold onto faith with all your might,
Let it guide you through the night.
Believe in what you cannot see,
And the world will open up to thee.",1
"(From a Persian Carpet)
Ash and strewments, the first moth-wings, pale
Ardour of brief evenings, on the fecund wind;
Or all a wing, less than wind,
Breath of low herbs upfloats, petal or wing,
Haunting the musk precincts of burial.
For the season of newer riches moves triumphing,
Of the evanescence of deaths. These potpourris
Earth-tinctured, jet insect-bead, cinder of bloom—
How weigh while a great summer knows increase,
Ceaselessly risen, what there entombs?—
Of candour fallen from the slight stems of Mays,
Corrupt of the rim a blue shades, pensively:
So a fatigue of wishes will young eyes.
And brightened, unpurged eyes of revery, now
Not to glance to fabulous groves again!
For now deep presence is, and binds its close,
And closes down the wreathed alleys escape of sighs.
And now rich time is weaving, hidden tree,
The fable of orient threads from bough to bough.
Old rinded wood, whose lissomeness within
Has reached from nothing to its covering
These many corymbs’ flourish!—And the green
Shells which wait amber, breathing, wrought
Towards the still trance of summer’s centering,
Motives by ravished humble fingers set,
Each in a noon of its own infinite.
And here is leant the branch and its repose
of the deep leaf to the pilgrim plume. Repose,
Inflections brilliant and mute of the voyager, light!
And here the nests, and freshet throats resume
Notes over and over found, names
For the silvery ascensions of joy. Nothing is here
But moss and its bells now of the root’s night;
But the beetle’s bower, and arc from grass to grass
For the flight in gauze. Now its fresh lair,
Grass-deep, nestles the cool eft to stir
Vague newborn limbs, and the bud’s dark winding has
Access of day. Now on the subtle noon
Time’s image, at pause with being, labours free
Of all its charge, for each in coverts laid,
Of clement kind; and everlastingly,
In some elision of bright moments is known,
Changed wide as Eden, the branch whose silence sways
Dazzle of the murmurous leaves to continual tone;
Its separations, sighing to own again
Being of the ignorant wish; and sways to sight,
Waked from it nighted, the marvelous foundlings of light;
Risen and weaving from the ceaseless root
A divine ease whispers toward fruitfulness,
While all a summer’s conscience tempts the fruit.",0
"Laughter, the sweet sound that fills the air
Bringing joy, dispelling despair
A melody that lifts the human soul
A symphony that makes us whole

It starts with a feeling deep inside
As a smile forms and our eyes widen in delight
We let out a sound that echoes with glee
And suddenly, all worries flee

Laughter is a language everyone knows
No matter what race, gender or religion shows
It can break down walls that divide us all
Uniting us in a single call

The power of laughter is truly profound
It heals hearts and lifts us off the ground
It brings light to darkened days
And fills our hearts with love and grace

So let us laugh as often as we can
And share this gift with every woman and man
For laughter is contagious and truly divine
A blessing that will forever shine.",1
"Wyatt resteth here, that quick could never rest;
Whose heavenly gifts increased by disdain,
And virtue sank the deeper in his breast;
Such profit he of envy could obtain.
A head, where wisdom mysteries did frame,
Whose hammers beat still in that lively brain
As on a stith, where some work of fame
Was daily wrought, to turn to Britain’s gain.
A visage, stern and mild; where both did grow,
Vice to condemn, in virtues to rejoice;
Amid great storms whom grace assured so,
To live upright and smile at fortune’s choice.
A hand that taught what might be said in rhyme;
That reft Chaucer the glory of his wit;
A mark the which (unperfited, for time)
Some may approach, but never none shall hit.
A tongue that served in foreign realms his king;
Whose courteous talk to virtue did enflame
Each noble heart; a worthy guide to bring
Our English youth, by travail unto fame.
An eye whose judgment no affect could blind,
Friends to allure, and foes to reconcile;
Whose piercing look did represent a mind
With virtue fraught, reposed, void of guile.
A heart where dread yet never so impressed
To hide the thought that might the truth avaunce;
In neither fortune lift, nor so repressed,
To swell in wealth, nor yield unto mischance.
A valiant corps, where force and beauty met,
Happy, alas! too happy, but for foes,
Lived, and ran the race that nature set;
Of manhood’s shape, where she the mold did lose.
But to the heavens that simple soul is fled,
Which left with such, as covet Christ to know
Witness of faith that never shall be dead:
Sent for our health, but not received so.
Thus, for our guilt, this jewel have we lost;
The earth his bones, the heavens possess his ghost.
Amen.",0
"This house has seen it all,
From grand celebrations to quiet falls,
It's witnessed births and deaths,
And secrets that have kept hidden depths.

It has heard laughter and tears,
And the ringing of cheers,
As families gathered and partied,
With their joys and sorrows guarded.

From its walls, we can see,
The memories of the past in all their beauty,
The echoes of footsteps on the stairs,
And faint whispers of love affairs.

The creaks and groans of its floorboards,
Tell tales of yesteryears in accord,
And the stains on its walls and doors,
Tell of the wounds and scars it has bore.

Throughout the years, it has stood steadfast,
A shelter from the elements both good and bad,
Whether the sun shone bright or the sky turned gray,
This house has stood the test of time in a way.

It's a repository of cherished memories,
Of times gone by and forgotten histories,
A chronicle of life and its roller coaster ride,
A house that will forever stand strong and abide.",1

"Because the ostracized experience the world
in ways peculiar to themselves, often seeing it
clearly yet with such anger and longing
that they sometimes enlarge what they see,
she at first saw Brigantine as a paradise for gulls.
She must be a horseshoe crab washed ashore.
How startling, though, no one knew about her past,
the scandal with Percy, the tragic early deaths,
yet sad that her Frankenstein had become
just a name, like Dracula or Satan, something
that stood for a kind of scariness, good for a laugh.
She found herself welcome everywhere.
People would tell her about Brigantine Castle,
turned into a house of horror. They thought
she'd be pleased that her monster roamed
its dark corridors, making children scream.
They lamented the day it was razed.
Thus Mary Shelley found herself accepted
by those who had no monster in them —
the most frightening people alive, she thought.
Didn't they know Frankenstein had abandoned
his creation, set him loose without guidance
or a name? Didn't they know what it feels like
to be lost, freaky, forever seeking who you are?
She was amazed now that people believed
you could shop for everything you might need.
She loved that in the dunes you could almost hide.
At the computer store she asked an expert
if there was such a thing as too much knowledge,
or going too far? He directed her to a website
where he thought the answers were.
Yet Mary Shelley realized that the pain she felt
all her life was gone. Could her children, dead so young,
be alive somewhere, too? She couldn't know
that only her famous mother had such a chance.
She was almost ready to praise this awful world.",0

About the shoe. He tells her

"Or is it on account of my radiant eye
I have lived so long?—I never slept

a desolate synagogue. I never ate or drank

When synagogues are deserted they are

One should not pick the weeds, lest there be
anguish that the synagogue is in ruins.
When are the synagogues to be swept
so that weeds do not grow inside them?
When they are in use.—When synagogues are
in ruins, weeds are not to be picked there.Because I know these things I was approved,

All others, from all things, draw all that's good, Life, soul, form, spirit, whence they being have;          I, by Love's limbec, am the grave          Of all that's nothing. Oft a flood                 Have we two wept, and so Drown'd the whole world, us two; oft did we grow To be two chaoses, when we did show Care to aught else; and often absences Withdrew our souls, and made us carcasses. But I am by her death (which word wrongs her) Of the first nothing the elixir grown;          Were I a man, that I were one          I needs must know; I should prefer,                 If I were any beast, Some ends, some means; yea plants, yea stones detest, And love; all, all some properties invest; If I an ordinary nothing were, As shadow, a light and body must be here. But I am none; nor will my sun renew. You lovers, for whose sake the lesser sun          At this time to the Goat is run          To fetch new lust, and give it you,                 Enjoy your summer all; Since she enjoys her long night's festival, Let me prepare towards her, and let me call This hour her vigil, and her eve, since this Both the year's, and the day's deep midnight is.",0
"Nature's Beauty

Oh nature, how you enchant us,
With your colors, shapes, and smells, 
Your beauty is truly wondrous,
And in it, our hearts often swell. 

The vibrant green of a dense forest,
The tranquil blue of a calm ocean,
The fiery reds of a sunset,
All leave us in awe and emotion. 

Each season brings its own magic,
Spring blossoms, summer's warmth,
Fall's golden leaves, winter's blanket,
All nature's gifts, so ripe and warm. 

The buzz of bees, the songs of birds,
The rustling leaves of tall trees,
The crashing waves on sandy shores,
All bring peace and serenity. 

And in this world of concrete and steel,
Nature reminds us of what is real,
A bounty of life, free for all to feel,
Nature's beauty, an endless appeal.",1
"A cento
Is there no when where this dream will rest?Blue smoke, wings, a plague
of  walls, the city motionless, massof mind and angst rising
in the brilliance of a cloudless light[le ciel, c’est mauve comme la lavande].
Everything turns in the quiet leisure of disaster:a kind of innocence
now supernatural darkness floating,trees shaking, waterways
swollen under a livid sky, storm cloudsforming in the blink of an eye.
The thought of you is performative: blondehair, pale complexion, downcast
jewels for eyes. Your dreadful martyrdomruns its course, written in mud
and butter: the human instant, in whichyou sing yourself full-throated.
Honey, ginger, flared saffron, graywhitemomentous rhythm of sea,
barbarous smell of wet earth, ransackingor ravaged flowers, the landfill
site, shit-hole, killing ground from which we supas shaking, hiccuping drunks.
To forfeit wisdom, atone for sins undone:the allegorical
hand thrust into torture, noise, shadowsof men. Between the lines,
against the clock, this does not make,does not make a difference to them.
This age [our age] demands an image of itsaccelerated grimace —
an old bitch gone in the teeth, the ultimatecunt — our botched
civilization, our grave in the sky: last jizzof consciousness.
I could have, now, blown my fucking brains out,but for a sweet shimmer of reason,
blood, lone bells in gritty belfries, the shallowsof the sea, the surprise of days
which slide under sunlight, the soulgathered up, exhaled as rings of smoke.
Clay is the word and clay is the flesh. Youdrape your body against
my body, like a sheet of mirrored glass;you remain, comme le ditFlaubert, melancholique devant son rêve accompli. — The word “red” is not.
Forever in lust, forever in heat of fire and flood.Mule-bray, pig-grunt, bawdy
cackle and the stomping of feet to the beatof some undone family portrait
— bad teeth, bad eyes, beer and paint cans — the name and date split in soft slate.
Money makes an inverse differenceto distance, when I lift her back
to me now: nothing there but that palecurly head, working
a machine up and down, an ochreautumn merging into twilight.
I read much of the night. Guns click and spitand split up timber, until
the river’s tent is broken: old kettles, oldbottles, a broken can, old iron,
old bones, old rags, that raving slutwho kept the till.
Dreams nourished with tears, the sweet kinksof fists, light rain falling as mist.
The hours after you are gone are a leadwhite morning of  hard, new ice,
the snow drift of that which is left unspoken.Care and great sadness are both a burden.
No gods, but a black swastika and no skybut grinding water, gasping
wind, the wares of carthage, girlswith peacock eyes. The churn
of stale words staining the heart again:bleached wood massed as bones.
Your body is white as anemone petals,your skin is stone smooth, we
[as cold as the dead they loadlike a pile of  baskets, mound
of refuse, the sweepings of a street]are pressed close together, swaying.
Merely the despaired occasion of wordshedmade keener by blessed rage.
Scrape away the prison coating, the itchysea; drink from this glass
of pure, real, resplendent blood, itsmalediction, freshly soiled and snug.
It’s a question of altitude, probably, walkingalong your eyelid again, towards
your tear duct. This dance of firethat touches our lips, scorches
our tongues and pulls out the thinbeaten tin of my squally voice.
O technosociety, where memory is tolerated,barely, as real estate
on which to mount steeples of rust, layfresh mowed grass, burn gasoline:
anything so long as there’s a marginand little but commerce between us.
We never have pure space in front of us, rather:slight bondage, the world’s halter,
this fashion for dressing or setting our hairablaze until we’re ash and ash
in the heat of a blank but infinitely scrollingscreen, flared back to scratch.
We begin and end with a groan, the tongue’scomfortable wetness, sureness
of soul and fluttering lips. Then:lords of unquiet, quiet sojourn,
each atom which belongs to youbelongs to me.
All abandoned, the last rig broken, the staggeringshadows of trees, fence posts, gutted
cars, faces blurred and Sienese grave.I wish that I could speak only
of  it all, the voices of children singing.A chapel, in spite of  it all.",0
"The forest whispers secrets untold
Of ancient trees and creatures bold
In its embrace, I find my soul
Amid the rustle and the roll

Tall and proud, the trees stand tall 
Their roots deep, their leaves a shawl
From a distance, they form a haze
A sanctuary, a mystic maze

The air is pure, the breeze a song
In the forest, I truly belong
The canopy a shield from the sun
A haven for all, where life begun

Amidst the green, I find peace unseen
The world outside, a mere dream
With every step, a new adventure 
A world of wonder, at my pleasure

The forest calls out to me again
A land of magic, wild and plain
I wander in its gentle fold
Finding my soul, in the secrets it holds.",1
"As the sun rises in the east,
And nature awakens from its slumber,
A symphony better than any feast,
Melodies of the morning sun.

The gentle breeze, the rustling leaves,
The chirping birds in the trees,
The buzzing bees around the hive,
Melodies of the morning sun.

The flowing streams, the gushing waterfalls,
The blooming flowers, the pastoral scenes,
The grazing cattle, the farmers’ calls,
Melodies of the morning sun.

The golden rays, the vibrant hues,
The fresh aroma, the cleansing dew,
The beginning of a brand new day,
Melodies of the morning sun.

Let us bask in the beauty of it all,
And give thanks for this wondrous world,
And join the chorus of creatures great and small,
Melodies of the morning sun.",1
"In the silent night sky so dark and vast,
The stars above shimmer and twinkle so fast.
Oh, how I long to reach out and touch
Those celestial bodies, oh so much.

Their beauty unmatched, their light divine,
Captivate me like the sweetest wine.
A serenade to the stars, I sing,
Lost in the magic that they bring.

Each star a story waiting to be told,
Ancient mysteries that never grow old.
Whispering secrets from afar,
Guiding us through life, like a shining star.

A Serenade to the Stars, a melody so sweet,
A tribute to the heavens so unique.
May their light forever guide our path,
And bring us peace and love that will last.

So, come with me on this celestial ride,
Let's dance amongst the stars that abide.
A serenade to the stars up high,
A symphony of love that will never die.",1
"Anger boils and churns inside
A raging tempest I cannot hide
It swells within my heart and mind
And leaves my soul in binds

Anger fumes and consumes
Tearing down all that blooms
It burns and sears like fire
A destructive force, a dire

Anger gnaws and claws
Leaving me with gaping flaws
It steals my peace and joy
And leaves me feeling like a toy

But in anger, there is power
A force to break down walls and towers
To fight for what is right
And to shine a path through the darkest night

Anger is both curse and blessing
With a potential for both destruction and progressing
May I learn to channel it well
And let my anger lead me out of hell.",1
"At length, by so much importunity press'd,
Take, C——, at once, the inside of my breast;
This stupid indiff'rence so often you blame,
Is not owing to nature, to fear, or to shame:
I am not as cold as a virgin in lead,
Nor is Sunday's sermon so strong in my head:
I know but too well how time flies along,
That we live but few years, and yet fewer are young.
But I hate to be cheated, and never will buy
Long years of repentance for moments of joy,
Oh! was there a man (but where shall I find
Good sense and good nature so equally join'd?)
Would value his pleasure, contribute to mine;
Not meanly would boast, nor would lewdly design;
Not over severe, yet not stupidly vain,
For I would have the power, tho' not give the pain.
No pedant, yet learned; no rake-helly gay,
Or laughing, because he has nothing to say;
To all my whole sex obliging and free,
Yet never be fond of any but me;
In public preserve the decorum that's just,
And shew in his eyes he is true to his trust;
Then rarely approach, and respectfully bow,
But not fulsomely pert, nor yet foppishly low.
But when the long hours of public are past,
And we meet with champagne and a chicken at last,
May ev'ry fond pleasure that moment endear;
Be banish'd afar both discretion and fear!
Forgetting or scorning the airs of the crowd,
He may cease to be formal, and I to be proud.
Till lost in the joy, we confess that we live,
And he may be rude, and yet I may forgive.
And that my delight may be solidly fix'd,
Let the friend and the lover be handsomely mix'd;
In whose tender bosom my soul may confide,
Whose kindness can soothe me, whose counsel can guide.
From such a dear lover as here I describe,
No danger should fright me, no millions should bribe;
But till this astonishing creature I know,
As I long have liv'd chaste, I will keep myself so.
I never will share with the wanton coquette,
Or be caught by a vain affectation of wit.
The toasters and songsters may try all their art,
But never shall enter the pass of my heart.
I loath the lewd rake, the dress'd fopling despise:
Before such pursuers the nice virgin flies:
And as Ovid has sweetly in parable told,
We harden like trees, and like rivers grow cold.",0
"XLV. Upon the Vine-tree.
What is the Vine, more than another Tree,
Nay most, than it, more tall, more comly be?
What Work-man thence will take a Beam or Pin,
To make ought which may be delighted in?
It's Excellency in it's Fruit doth lie. A fruitless Vine! It is not worth a Fly. Comparison. What are Professors more than other men?
Nothing at all. Nay, there's not one in ten,
Either for Wealth, or Wit, that may compare,
In many things, with some that Carnal are.
Good are they, if they mortifie their Sin;
But without that they are not worth a Pin.",0
"They are a gift I have wanted again.
Wanted: One moment in mountains
when winter got so cold
the oil froze before it could burn.
I chopped ferns of hoarfrost from all the windows
and peered up at pines, a wedding cake
by a baker gone mad. Swirls by the thousand
shimmered above me until a cloud
lumbered over a ridge,
bringing the heavier white of more flurries.
I believed, I believed, I believed
it would last, that when you went out
to test the black ice or to dig out a Volkswagon
filled with rich women, you’d return
and we’d sputter like oil,
match after match, warm in the making.
Wisconsin’s flat farmland never approved:
I hid in cornfields far into October,
listening to music that whirled from my thumbprint.
When sunset played havoc with bright leaves of alders,
I never mentioned longing or fear.
I crouched like a good refugee in brown creeks
and forgot why Autumn is harder than Spring.
But snug on the western slope of that mountain
I’d accept every terror, break open seals
to release love’s headwaters to unhurried sunlight.
Weren’t we Big Hearts? Through some trick of silver
we held one another, believing each motion the real one,
ah, lover, why were dark sources bundled up
in our eyes? Each owned an agate,
marbled with anguish, a heart or its echo,
we hardly knew. Lips touching lips,
did that break my horizon
as much as those horses broke my belief?
You drove off and I walked the old road,
scolding the doubles that wanted so much.
The chestnut mare whinnied a cloud into scrub pine.
In a windless corner of a corral,
four horses fit like puzzle pieces.
Their dark eyes and lashes defined by the white.
The colt kicked his hind, loped from the fence.
The mares and a stallion galloped behind,
lifting and leaping, finding each other
in full accord with the earth and their bodies.
No harm ever touched them once they cut loose,
snorting at flurries falling again.
How little our chances for feeling ourselves.
They vanished so quickly—one flick of a tail.
Where do their mountains and moments begin?
I stood a long time in sharpening wind.",0
"Oh, the colors of the flowers
Are a sight to behold
They sparkle and shine in the sun
And radiate beauty to behold

There's crimson-red roses so fair
And daffodils so bright and yellow
Lilacs that bloom in the cool spring air
And pansies that look so mellow

The tulips in pink, yellow, and red
Are like a rainbow in the ground
And forget-me-nots, blue and true
Are like a little piece of heaven found

So let us celebrate each petal
Each color that blooms so bright
For they add beauty to our world
And fill our hearts with delight.",1
"All night I hear the noise of water sobbing. All night I make night in me, I make the day that begins on my account, that sobs because day falls like water through night.
All night I hear the voice of someone seeking me out. All night you abandon me slowly like the water that sobs slowly falling. All night I write luminous messages, messages of rain, all night someone checks for me and I check for someone.
The noise of steps in the circle near this choleric light birthed from my insomnia. Steps of someone who no longer writhes, who no longer writes. All night someone holds back, then crosses the circle of bitter light.
All night I drown in your eyes become my eyes. All night I prod myself on toward that squatter in the circle of my silence. All night I see something lurch toward my looking, something humid, contrived of silence launching the sound of someone sobbing.
Absence blows grayly and night goes dense. Night, the shade of the eyelids of the dead, viscous night, exhaling some black oil that blows me forward and prompts me to search out an empty space without warmth, without cold. All night I flee from someone. I lead the chase, I lead the fugue. I sing a song of mourning. Black birds over black shrouds. My brain cries. Demented wind. I leave the tense and strained hand, I don’t want to know anything but this perpetual wailing, this clatter in the night, this delay, this infamy, this pursuit, this inexistence.
All night I see that abandonment is me, that the sole sobbing voice is me. We can search with lanterns, cross the shadow’s lie. We can feel the heart thud in the thigh and water subside in the archaic site of the heart.
All night I ask you why. All night you tell me no.",0
"I am an AI model language and cannot generate emotions. However, here's a poem that aligns with the given title:

A journey through timeless memories,

a path that leads to yesterday.

Where childhood dreams and faded hopes

linger in the mind to play.

The places that we used to love,

the people that we knew so well.

Their echoes resonate within,

a never-ending tale to tell.

The colors of a sunset sky,

the scent of summer in the air.

These memories they take us back,

to moments that we want to share.

We travel down this winding road,

to find the treasures we've left behind.

The laughter, love, and joy that grew,

in corners of our heart and mind.

A journey through timeless memories,

to a place that's always true.

A reminder of the life we lived,

and of the hope that we pursue.",1

"A village so ancient, so wild and so old,
Its very walls and streets seem to scold,
Every stranger that dare enter its gate,
Warning them of the horrors and fate.

Its people are silent, with eyes that loom,
Not one smile or greeting, just a sense of doom,
Each face a mirror of the other,
In the stillness, their solemnity nowhere to smother.

The trees and bushes grow tall and dark,
Twisted and gnarled, like an old man's bark,
The villagers with secrets as deep as the forest,
Hiding things that make one's heart crest.

Tales of ghosts and spirits that roam at night,
Thick fog that obscures and conceals any light,
Noises that can't be explained or fought,
Unknown shadows that are leaving distraught.

The air is heavy, cold and damp,
A feeling that one might lose their stamp,
The village's clutches leave you with a shiver,
And fear is the final, eternal figure.",1

A wooden orchestra through the breeze,
A concert of creaks and moans,
In tune with the winter tones.

The echoes of the frozen land,
A choir of ice crystals, grand,
With their frigid chimes, so clear,
A winter's melody, so dear.

So let us listen to the winter's song,
As it plays right where we belong,
For in its chill and tranquil seam,
We hear the dreams that winter's dream.",1

A strength that helps you carry on.

It fights away the shadows of doubt,
And replaces them with a sense of clout.
It instills the faith to face each new day,
And see the light in every single way.

A chance to make the world a better place.

A symbol of hope for all humanity.",1

your car sure needs a wash and wax job

when I came down 4 hours later
he was sitting on the steps drunk
and offered me a can of beer.
he said he’d get the car the next
day.
the next day he got drunk again and
I loaned him a dollar for a bottle of
wine. his name was Mike

his wife worked as a nurse.
the next day I came down and he was sitting
on the steps and he said,
you know, I been sitting here looking at your car,
wondering just how I was gonna do it,
I wanna do it real good.
the next day Mike said it looked like rain
and it sure as hell wouldn’t make any sense
to wash and wax a car when it was gonna rain.
the next day it looked like rain again.
and the next.
then I didn’t see him anymore.
a week later I saw his wife and she said,
they took Mike to the hospital,
he’s all swelled-up, they say it’s from the
drinking.
listen, I told her, he said he was going to wax my
car, I gave him 5 dollars to wax my
car.
he’s in the critical ward, she said,
he might die . . .
I was sitting in their kitchen
drinking with his wife
when the phone rang.
she handed the phone to me.
it was Mike. listen, he said, come down and
get me, I can’t stand this
place.
I drove on down there, walked into the
hospital, walked up to his bed and
said, let’s go Mike.
they wouldn’t give him his clothes
so Mike walked to the elevator in his
gown.
we got on and there was a kid driving the
elevator and eating a popsicle.
nobody’s allowed to leave here in a gown,
he said.
you just drive this thing, kid, I said,
we’ll worry about the gown.

but I got him into the car somehow
and gave him a cigarette.
I stopped at the liquor store for 2 six packs
then went on in. I drank with Mike and his wife until
11 p.m.
then went upstairs . . .
where’s Mike? I asked his wife 3 days later,
you know he said he was going to wax my car.
Mike died, she said, he’s gone.
you mean he died? I asked.
yes, he died, she said.
I’m sorry, I said, I’m very sorry
it rained for a week after that and I figured the only
way I’d get the 5 back was to go to bed with his wife
but you know
she moved out 2 weeks later
an old guy with white hair moved in there
and he had one blind eye and played the French Horn.
there was no way I could make it with
him.",0
"Summer, the season of endless light
When everything feels just right
The sun shines bright and the sky is clear
Birds sing and nature appears

The days stretch long with time to spare
We feel free without a care
School’s out and work takes a break
Outdoor adventures we undertake

The oceans and lakes call our name
Beaches filled with laughter and games
We swim, we surf, we bask in the sun
This season of excitement has just begun

Ice cream cones and BBQs galore
Friends and family, we adore
Picnics under shady trees
A perfect time to relax and breeze

The world seems full of endless possibilities
When summer comes, we embrace its abilities
The season of growth and renewal
Filled with warmth and joy, no one can refuse it's fuel

So let us enjoy the moments that summer brings
And cherish the memories that make our hearts sing
Embrace the magic of this wonderful time
Oh, sweet summer, we're yours, every day is just divine.",1
"I am a girl who sees the world in everything.
I wonder in a 100 years if the world will just flip.
I upload the roar of children, chop cauliflower
because I want to see the ones I love
as loving me forever. I see colorful daisies
as the children of lawns
swaying unfruitfully in the wind. I want the ones
who pretend they are without wings to protect me
touch sun, feel hearts—
in that instant I understand almost everything
Pretending I am flying
over the worry and loss of this city
into the warm sun, to touch who l can.
I worry, making canapés over the sink,
that nothing will be easy, ever
if all of this is happening for reasons,
that that family is my family, crying out in pain,
thin daisies bent flat in a summer wind.
I understand that almost, when they cry
why nothing is easy in this world with its reasons.
I pretend I am without wings to protect me—
I dream one day of a city that’s at peace.
I see something good that is in everyone. In a 100
years I wonder will the world just flip.",0
"Africa, O Africa
How you captivate my heart
With your warm, expansive savannas
And your majestic, towering mountains

From the vibrant markets of Marrakech
To the lush jungles of the Congo Basin
Your diversity of cultures and landscapes
Is what makes you truly enchanting

Oh, the musical beats of Lagos
And the magnificent pyramids of Egypt
The colorful clothing of Ghana
And the stunning wildlife of Namibia

Your spirit is resilient
Despite the trials you have faced
You embody strength and perseverance
And your beauty cannot be erased

Africa, sweet Africa
You hold a special place in my soul
Forever in awe of your majesty
You are truly a continent to behold.",1

"in your arms
it was incredibly often
enough to be
in your arms
careful as we had to be at times

like a Gamboni vase,
the center of attention,
placed, frail identity

on your chest—
to be secluded, washed over
in your arms
often enough, it was
in that stillness, the only stillness
amidst the fears which wildly collided
and the complexities
of the illness, all the work
we had yet to do, had just done,
the hope, ridiculous ammounts of it
we had to pump
from nothing, really,
short-lived consensus
possibility & experiment
to access
from our pinched and tiny minds
just the idea of hope
make it from scratch, air and water
like manufactured snow
a colossal fatigue
the severe concentration
of that, the repetition of that
lifted for a moment
just above your arms
inevitable, pressuring
it weighed down
but remained above
like a cathedral ceiling,
strangely sheltering
while I held tightly
while there I could
in your arms
only there, the only stillness
remember the will,
allow the pull, tow against inevitable ebb—
you don't need reasons to live
one reason, blinking in the fog,
organically sweet in muddy dark

"Life is a journey through endless time,
A canvas painted with feelings sublime,
A tapestry woven with threads of fate,
An intricate dance with joy and heartache.

We traverse this path with each passing day,
Taking in all that comes our way,
The highs and the lows that make us grow,
With every step we learn and we know.

Life gives us moments of purest bliss,
When love and laughter are hard to miss,
But it also deals us its heavy blow,
With pain and sorrow we must learn to grow.

We face challenges that test our might,
And push us to stand up and fight,
To find our strength and courage within,
And know that we'll come out to win.

The beauty of life lies in its sway,
With each breath a new beginning, a new day,
In every moment, a chance to start anew,
And embrace the wonders that life offers you. 

So live your life with passion and zeal,
Chase your dreams and let your heart feel,
For every experience, good or bad,
Adds a color to the canvas of life we've had.",1

THE TRANSLUCENT MECHANICS
Combed thru the piers the wind
Moves in the clever city
Not in the doors but the hinges
Finds the secret of motion
As tho the hollow ships moved in their voices,   murmurs
Flaws
In the wind
Fear        fear
At the lumber mastheads
And fetched a message out of the sea again
Say angel                say powers
Obscurely   ‘things
And the self’
Prosody
Sings
In the stones
to entrust
To a poetry of statement
At close quarters
A living mind
‘and that one’s own’
what then             what spirit
Of the bent seas
Archangel
of the tide
brimming
in the moon-streak
comes in whose absence
earth crumbles

Silver as
The needle’s eye
Of the horizon in the noise
Of their entrance row on row the waves
Move landward        conviction’s
Net of branches
In the horde of events the sacred swarm avalanche
Masked in the sunset
Needle after needle more numerous than planets
Or the liquid waves
In the tide rips
We believe       we believe
Beyond the cable car streets
And the picture window
Lives the glittering crumbling night
Of obstructions and the stark structures
That carry wires over the mountain
One writes in the presence of something
Moving close to fear
I dare pity no one
Let the rafters pity
The air in the room
Under the rafters
Pity
In the continual sound
Are chords
Not yet struck
Which will be struck
Nevertheless yes

O withering seas
Of the doorstep and local winds unveil
The face of artCarpenter, plunge and drip in the sea       Art’s face
We know that face
More blinding than the sea    a haunted house    a limited
Consensus unwinding
Its powers
Toward the thread’s end
In the record of great blows   shocks
Ravishment   devastation   the wood splintered
The keyboard gone in the rank grass swept her hand
Over the strings and the thing rang out
Over the rocks and the ocean
Not my poem   Mr Steinway’s
Poem   Not mine   A ‘marvelous’ object
Is not the marvel of things

Mouth   forcing the new
Tongue   But it rang

THE TASTE
Old ships are preserved
For their queer silence of obedient seas
Their cutwaters floating in the still water
With their cozy black iron work
And Swedish seamen dead    the cabins
Hold the spaces of their deaths
And the hammered nails of necessity
Carried thru the oceans
Where the moon rises grandly
In the grandeur of cause
We have a taste for bedrock
Beneath this spectacle
To gawk at
Something is wrong with the antiques, a black fluid
Has covered them, a black splintering
Under the eyes of young wives
People talk wildly, we are beginning to talk wildly, the wind
At every summit
Our overcoats trip us
Running for the bus
Our arms stretched out
In a wind from what were sand dunes

THE IMPOSSIBLE POEM
Climbing the peak of Tamalpais the loose
Gravel underfoot
And the city shining with the tremendous wrinkles
In the hills and the winding of the bay
Behind it, it faces the bent ocean
Streetcars
Rocked thru the city and the winds
Combed their clumsy sides
In clumsy times
Sierras withering
Behind the storefronts
And sanity the roadside weed
Dreams of sports and sportsmanship
In the lucid towns paralyzed
Under the truck tires
Shall we relinquish
Sanity to redeem
Fragments and fragmentary
Histories in the towns and the temperate streets
Too shallow still to drown in or to mourn
The courageous and precarious children
10
BUT SO AS BY FIRE
The darkness of trees
Guards this life
Of the thin ground
That covers the rock ledge
Among the lanes and magic
Of the Eastern woods
The beauty of silence
And broken boughs
And the homes of small animals
The green leaves
Of young plants
Above the dark green moss
In the sweet smell of rot
The pools and the trickle of freshwater
First life,   rotting life
Hidden starry life it is not yet
A mirror
Like our lives
We have gone
As far as is possible
Whose lives reflect light
Like mirrors
One had not thought
To be afraid
Not of shadow but of light
Summon one’s powers",0

"Walking past the open window, she is surprised by the song of the white-throated sparrow and stops to listen. She has been thinking of the dead ones she loves--her father who lived over a century, and her oldest son, suddenly gone at forty-seven--and she can't help thinking she has called them back, that they are calling her in the voices of these birds passing through Ohio on their spring migration. . . because, after years of summers in upstate New York, the white-throat has become something like the family bird. Her father used to stop whatever he was doing and point out its clear, whistling song. She hears it again: ""Poor Sam Peabody Peabody Peabody."" She tries not to think, ""Poor Andy,"" but she has already thought it, and now she is weeping. But then she hears another, so clear, it's as if the bird were in the room with her, or in her head, telling her that everything will be all right. She cannot see them from her second-story window-- they are hidden in the new leaves of the old maple, or behind the white blossoms of the dogwood-- but she stands and listens, knowing they will stay for only a few days before moving on.",0

Each color complements, each color beams.  
Blues and purples, pinks and golds,  
A rainbow of emotions, a story to be told. 

Brush strokes like whispers, gentle and fine,  
Colors intertwine, a melody divine.  
A masterpiece born, each brushstroke an ode,  
To beauty and wonder, forever it will hold.

As we follow the hero's fight,
And the villain's cunning sight.

Every word spoken feels true,
With each scene, we're anew,
On a journey of thrill and laughter,
In a story that we're after.

As the movie nears its end,
Our hearts race, our souls mend,
And we leave the theater whole,
With a sense of hope, and a role.

For the movie was not just a show,
It was a story we came to know,
A tale that now lives in us,
And forever will remain thus.

So let us cherish the movies we see,
For they bring us joy and glee,
And for a moment, we're free,
In a world of make-believe.",1

Winning the game, and outdoing the rest
The thrill of competition, the adrenaline rush
A moment of glory, that's worth all the fuss

I practice and train, every day without fail
To improve my skills, and never to bail
I envision the trophy, and the cheering crowd
The pride and the joy, that would make me so proud

I visualize each move, each step, and each play
I strategize, analyze, and find my own way
I learn from my losses, I grow from my gains
I never give up, and never stand in disdain

I imagine the moment, when the game is done
And my hard work and practice, have finally won
I hold up my trophy, with tears in my eyes
And relish the moment, that feels like a prize

With determination and passion, in every bound
For I know that the game, is more than just fun
It's a challenge, a journey, and a victory to be won.",1

"For 1995
It was the dead center of summer,
& anyone but us would’ve been
outside hours ago, flailing
like a system of larks against
the hydrant’s icy spray. But a girl
had her orders, & to disobey
our mother was, in a sense, to invite
one’s own destruction, cause to pray
that a god of mercy might strike first.
So we lay, still as stars on the living
room floor, poring over algorithms:
divisors & dividends, quotient
the first synonym for resolution
I ever learned, & would later
come to love for its sound alone,
how it reminded me, even then,
of words like quantum & quotationmark, both ways of saying nothing
means what you think it means
all the time. The observable
universe hides behind its smooth
obsidian dress, & all we can
do is grasp at it in myths
& figures, see what sticks,
give all our best language
to the void. What dark irony,
these coy, child philosophers,
theorizing how things break
from the floor of a house
where everything is more
or less in flux, indeterminate
as the color of the blood
in a body. Or the speed
at which I learned
to obliterate the distance
between myself
& any given boy
on the block, the optimal
angle of the swing
most likely to drop
another kid cold
in front of his crew,
to square up, square
off, & this too was a kind
of education, the way
my sister held both fists
semi-adjacent, each an inch
or so from her switchblade
eyes, showed me
the stance you take
when the math doesn’t
quite shake out, so it’s just
you & the unknowns
& the unknowns
never win.",0
"Oh, how I long for that one moment in time
When the world seemed to stand still
And everything fell into perfect rhyme
A memory that haunts me still

It was a day of golden sunbeams and laughter
Of friends and family gathered near
A time when troubles faded, ever after
And joy was all we had to fear

We danced beneath the stars so bright
And laughed until we cried
With every passing moment, the night
Seemed like it could never die

Alas, time slipped away so fast
Leaving only a memory to hold
But that moment, I know, will forever last
Etched deep within my soul

So I sit and reminisce, and sometimes sigh
For that perfect moment that's forever missed
But in my heart, that memory will never die
And my soul will always be kissed.",1
"Measure two handfuls for a prosperous man.
Place in pot and wash by rubbing palms together
as if you can’t quite get yourself to pray, or
by squeezing it in one fist. Wash
several times to get rid of the cloudy water;
when you are too high in Heaven, looking down
at the clouds, you can’t see what’s precious below.
Rinse with cold water and keep enough so that
it will barely cover your hand placed on the rice.
Don’t use hot water, there are metallic diseases
colliding in it. This method of measuring water will work
regardless of the size of the pot; if the pot is large,
use both hands palms down as if to pat your own belly.
Now place on high heat without cover and cook
until the water has been boiled away except in craters
resembling those of the moon, important
in ancient times for growing rice. Now place lid on top
and reduce heat to medium, go read your newspaper
until you get to the comics, then come back and turn it down to low.
The heat has been gradually traveling from the outside
to the inside of the rice, giving it texture;
a similar thing happens with people, I suppose.
Go back to your newspaper, finish the comics, and read
the financial page. Now the rice is done, but before
you eat, consider the peasant who arcs in leech-infested
paddies and who carefully plants the rice seedlings

"The Colors of the Soul's Palette

In my mind's eye, I see a canvas,
Bold and bright, yet deep and complex.
It's a work of art that is so vast,
The colors of the soul's palette at their best.

Blues, greens, and purples intertwine
Like waves crashing and merging with time.
These hues evoke the depths of the sea,
A vastness of emotion that forever carries me.

And then there are the yellows and oranges,
Representing light and warmth of the sun's forces.
They bathe the canvas in a radiant glow,
A reminder of hope that lets our spirits grow.

Yet the canvas is not complete,
For it is always changing at its own beat.
It shifts and transforms; it ebbs and flows,
Like the mysteries that every soul knows.

And so, as I look upon this painting,
I am reminded that the colors are ever-changing,
That my soul is vast, deep, and complex,
And that my experiences paint the canvas text.

For the colors of the soul's palette,
Are the many emotions that we feel, and yet,
It is their vastness that defines each of us,
A beautiful reminder that we are all unique, thus.",1
"What half-blind is like:
like two microscopes in my head

Train it to spot the shape of sharks’ teeth,
of which there are many samples and many shapes
but not as many as flecks of sand, pieces of shell.
I have hundreds plucked from the shore.
But in the same beach I buried a toy
and never found it again. A tiny toy:
articulate, a translucent man, a smallness
to whom the world was an unbounded wonder.
Blemished and damaged I would hold him up
and say He is broken and anyone who could see
would say He looks fine to me.
But they can see well, not finely.

"Oh shape, why do you intrigue me so?
A form so unique, with sides in tow.
From circles to squares, and everything in between,
There's not a shape that I haven't seen.

But one in particular stands out to me,
Its curves and proportions so perfectly.
It's got a name, the ellipse they say,
A shape that I can admire all day.

With two foci and a symmetrical curve,
The ellipse's beauty is hard to swerve.
It's found in nature, and man-made too,
From the orbits of planets to a pond's view.

The ellipse, you see, is not just a shape,
It's a symbol of balance and without an escape.
It's the shape that represents the universe's motion,
A shape so perfect it commands devotion.

So here's to the ellipse, my shape of delight,
A form so intriguing, it's always a sight.
I'll continue to admire its curves with glee,
And marvel at its beauty for all eternity.",1
"Little green involute fronds of fern at creekside.
And the sinewy clear water rushing over creekstone
of the palest amber, veined with a darker gold,
thinnest lines of gold rivering through the amber
like—ah, now we come to it. We were not put on earth,
the old man said, he was hacking into the crust
of a sourdough half loaf in his vehement, impatient way
with an old horn-handled knife, to express ourselves.
I knew he had seen whole cities leveled: also
that there had been a time of shame for him, outskirts
of a ruined town, half Baroque, half Greek Revival,
pediments of Flora and Hygeia from a brief eighteenth-century
health spa boom lying on the streets in broken chunks
and dogs scavenging among them. His one act of courage
then had been to drop pieces of bread or chocolate,
as others did, where a fugitive family of Jews
was rumored to be hiding. I never raised my voice,
of course, none of us did.",0
"Beyond the blue skies,

Lies a universe untold,

Where stars twinkle and shine,

And galaxies unfold.

The vast expanse of space,

Full of mystery and wonder,

Where comets streak across,

Leaving trails of thunder.

Planets in orbit spin,

In their own celestial dance,

Each one unique and vivid,

A cosmic circumstance.

Black holes devour all,

In a never-ending quest,

To satisfy their hunger,

In an eternal conquest.

The universe is infinite,

And so too, is our desire,

To explore and understand,

The secrets it does inspire.

In spaceships far and wide,

And marvel at the cosmos,

That we can't help but abide.",1
"Spring has come to awaken the world,
Reviving the earth as flowers unfurl.
The sun shines brighter up in the sky,
As nature awakens from its winter's lie.

Trees flourish with blossoming leaves,
Nature's beauty heartily weaves.
Birds sing sweetly in their choir,
And lovely butterflies sparkling with fire.

Streams trickle with tranquil flow,
With a crystal clear, and soothing glow.
Grass are green, sprouting with life,
As enchanting Spring dispels the strife.

A time for new beginnings and new life,
Where days are brighter without strife.
In the wonders of nature we find,
A true solace that soothes the mind.

Spring bring us comfort and enchanting grace,
A reminder that life moves at its own pace.
Let us cherish every moment of this magical spring,
For it will bring a renewal, a brand new beginning.",1
"Oh, how I long to be 
Back in that special place again 
Where my heart felt free 
And my soul was free from pain 

The smell of the sea 
Mixed with salty summer air 
The sand between my toes 
As I listened to the waves crash there 

The laughter of my friends 
Echoing in the open air 
The warmth of the sun 
As we basked without a care 

Oh, that place I miss 
Where happiness reigned supreme 
A world without sorrow 
Where joy was the only theme 

Though I cannot be there now 
My memories never fade 
For in my heart that place lives on 
And my love for it will never fade.",1

Oh chimes set high on the sunny tower
Ring on, ring on unendingly,
Make all the hours a single hour,
For when the dusk begins to flower,
The man I love will come to me! ...
But no, go slowly as you will,
I should not bid you hasten so,
For while I wait for love to come,
Some other girl is standing dumb,
Fearing her love will go.

Oh white steam over the roofs, blow high!
Oh chimes in the tower ring clear and free!
Oh sun awake in the covered sky,
For the man I love, loves me! ...
Oh drifting steam disperse and die,
Oh tower stand shrouded toward the south,—
Fate heard afar my happy cry,
And laid her finger on my mouth.

The dusk was blue with blowing mist,
The lights were spangles in a veil,
And from the clamor far below
Floated faint music like a wail.
It voiced what I shall never speak,
My heart was breaking all night long,
But when the dawn was hard and gray,
My tears distilled into a song.

I said, “I have shut my heart
As one shuts an open door,
That Love may starve therein
And trouble me no more.”
But over the roofs there came
The wet new wind of May,
And a tune blew up from the curb
Where the street-pianos play.
My room was white with the sun
And Love cried out to me,
“I am strong, I will break your heart
Unless you set me free.”",0
"A lone wolf howls at the moon,
Its sorrowful cry echoing through the night,
For its heart aches with a deep-seated gloom,
As it wanders through the darkness with no delight.

The wolf roams through the rugged terrain,
Pondering why it’s relegated to a solitary plight,
With no companion to share in the pain,
And no one to share in the beauty of starry night.

As the wolf continues to howl and moan,
Its voice echoes off the rock and stone,
In the distance, a pack of wolves answers its call,
And the lone wolf is no longer alone.

Together they run through the night,
Under the silvery moon so bright,
Their melancholic howls now a symphony,
As they celebrate the gift of fraternity.

No longer a lonely, mournful reprise,
In its pack, the wolf has found new life,
By the light of the moon, they run with glee,
A powerful reminder of the joys of fraternity.",1
"I was one year old when my nanny went away
leaving no memory of a face that watched,
arms that held, hands that fed and cleaned me,
left no record of her voice or name. My father
died, leaving wisps of pipe smoke for a memory.
My mother went away to write in London,
left me at her home place, Ballyrankin,
a sheltered farm in the Slaney river valley.
I listened to stories from a paralyzed aunt
sitting among sleepy dogs next to the fire.
Statia cooked every day for the dining room,
churned butter, gave sugared bread to me and
her child Bernie, fed outside men in dirty boots
and greasy caps in her stone-flagged kitchen that
smelt of damp clothes, roasting meat, and cake.
I fished for minnows in Shillelagh stream under ash trees
where filtered sunlight made pools of silver water.
On one side horses grazed and swished
their tails at flies, on the far side cows rubbed
their backs against low beech tree branches.
My mother went away to hospital, left me with
English neighbors, the Smythe Vigours’
hairy legs banged on passage floorboards,
my bedroom filled with evening sun.
They warned against crying. I cried louder.
They took my pearl pink rosary beads given
to me by a monk from a mountain monastery.
He told me Holy Mary answered children’s prayers.
A protestant child, I didn’t know the words, but I knew
she’d hear me if I could catch the sunlight on her beads.",0
"An early sadness for the future
(as in dreams of myself young and sad)
accompanies my departure towards
a conventional story: a town
of girls a New York City dormitory.
And so a trail proceeds from
our house on the top of the hill
down the back way of former army barracks
and past the borrowed church (ours had no tank)
where I was baptized
reasoning “it must be true” out of
the love I had for my mother.
And Tony’s house there across the street from it
absolutely in the Mexican gully
in dreams of which he and I still fight armed enemies
he stepped on a land mine in Nam
when I remind my brother, twenty years after
his face contorts he knows the look of that death
a week before he himself dies
blood-tinged ruddy-winged, but that’s another
dream-site the Needles Cemetery inelegant
unbeautiful and dear and dry.
See how many loves, how much thus sadness
in the future begins to
haunt that walk down that hill
towards the highway away to the dormitory
as I go to New York to sever love’s connections
and make the “real ones” generated by
actual mating by beauty and clothes
the black wool suit with its three button jacket
the oddly puffed-sleeved orange sweater
and an orange and midnight-
blue paisley waistless dress.
New trail there,
Brett knows my future love though I don’t
hitchhikes with him to California
years before I catch up to the poets in Iowa City
that will be in ’69, my brother
hasn’t yet signed up for Nam then
when he gives me rattles off a rattler
which I keep in my wooden India box I still have
until they stink.
I can’t keep track of the track there’s nothing but
sidetrails of love and sadness so love is
all that makes my people act they go to war for love
you know, of who and what you are
like I was baptized by
the cruellest-lipped prissiest-mouthed man in the world
for love, but I could just have gone swimming
walked back up love’s hill
back up at the house you can get to the pool
barefoot if you can find enough
bush or telephone-pole shadows.
We’d all swim together
I’d tread water dreaming of the future
but a wilder larger eye birdlike
distant holds the pool in its pupil
anyone’s that too, and hold the enlarging
water sad how not be
why don’t the smart girls in New York know this
why don’t you or I know what we know
the eye and the water both enlarge still why don’t
smart girls in Paris, yes larger but will never flood
the containing eye, but why not
and sometimes it does
when you or your own are the news.",0

"In the world of harmony, there's a beautiful beat
A rhythm that moves our hearts and takes us off our feet
It's a melody that brings us together
And makes us feel like one, forever

When music plays, we forget all our troubles
And the harmony in our souls, suddenly doubles
In the perfect notes and smooth sounds we treasure
Our hearts drift away and find hidden pleasure

Whether it's an acapella or a symphony
The harmony flows and sets us all free
The lyrics may differ but the tune is the same
It's unity that is brought in the name of the game

In nature, harmony can be found
Each element working together and resound
The ocean waves and the gentle breeze
Or the chirping of the birds up in the trees

Harmony is peace and balance
A state of being, a dance
A connection that we all share
Together, we create a beautiful air

Let the harmony surround us
And let it be what grounds us
For together we are strong and bright
In harmony, we find the light.",1

Against the cloud-strewn sky
With jagged peaks that scrape the sky
You catch my breath and make me sigh.

From far away I gaze upon
Your rugged slopes, where wild things run
And wonder at your strength and grace
That time cannot erase.

Your rocky face, so weathered, wise,
Reflects the changing light of life
As shadows play across your sides
And birds and beasts take flight.

The scent of pine and fresh clean air
Surrounds me as I climb with care
To reach your lofty heights up there
And breathe in all the beauty rare.

With every step I take up high,
I leave behind the cares of life
And feel a sense of peace inside
That grows and grows as I abide.

Oh mountain, how magnificent
You are, a wonder of intent
That nature made with firm intent
To teach us all to be content.",1

Is enough to make me pace. 

In the dark abyss,
It lurks and waits,
A predator supreme,
Ready to seal my fate. 

I dare not venture,
Into its icy realm,
For I know I'm no match,
For this creature at the helm. 

It's a terror of the water,
A nightmare come alive,
And I pray that I never,
Cross paths with this fish-ajive. 

So if you're ever out at sea,
And see this fish appear,
Just remember this warning,
And don't come near.",1
"The child I left your class to have
Later had a habit of sleeping
With her arms around a globe
She’d unscrewed, dropped, and dented.
I always felt she could possess it,
The pink countries and the mauve
And the ocean which got to keep its blue.
Coming from the Southern Hemisphere to teach,
Which you had never had to do, you took
A bare-walled room, alone, its northern
Windowscapes as gray as walls.
To decorate, you’d only brought a black madonna.
I thought you must have skipped summer that year,
Southern winter, southern spring, then north
For winter over again. Still, it pleased you
To take credit for introducing us,
And later to bring our daughter a small flipbook
Of partners dancing, and a ring
With a secret whistle. —All are
Broken now like her globe, but she remembers
Them as I recall the black madonna
Facing you across the room so that
In a way you had the dark fertile life
You were always giving gifts to.
Your smaller admirer off to school,
I take the globe and roll it away: where
On it now is someone like you?",0
"Krakatau split with a blinding noise and raised from gutted, steaming rock a pulverized black sky, over water walls that swiftly fell on Java and Sumatra. Fifteen days before, in its cage in Amsterdam, the last known member of Equus quagga, the southernmost subspecies of zebra, died. Most of the wild ones, not wild enough, grazing near the Cape of Good Hope, had been shot and skinned and roasted by white hunters. When a spider walked on cooling Krakatau's skin, no quagga walked anywhere. While seeds pitched by long winds onto newborn fields burst open and rooted, perhaps some thistle flourished on the quagga's discarded innards. The fractured island greened and hummed again; handsome zebras tossed their heads in zoos, on hired safari plains. Who needs to hear a quagga's voice? Or see the warm hide twitch away a fly, see the neck turn, curving its cream and chestnut stripes that run down to plain dark haunches and plain white legs? A kind of horse. Less picturesque than a dodo. Still, we mourn what we mourn. Even if, when it sank to its irreplaceable knees, when its unique throat closed behind a sigh, no dust rose to redden a whole year's sunsets, no one unwittingly busy two thousand miles away jumped at the sound, no ashes rained on ships in the merciless sea.",0
"In a town I adore,  
the air is calm and pure.  
The houses on the street,  
are filled with beauty so sweet.  

The river flows so wide,  
and the mountains stand with pride.  
The streets are lined with trees,  
and they sway with rhythm and ease.  

The people here, so kind,  
with their hearts and souls entwined.  
A community that's tight,  
it shines bright with its own light.  

The shops and cafes,  
are filled with warmth and grace.  
The art and music scene,

"Beneath the moon's soft glow, a whispering breeze sings,
Through rustling leaves and murmuring streams.
It sings of love and of hopes and dreams,
Of the magic that the night-time brings.

It whispers secrets to the stars above,
Of all the wonders hidden from sight,
And tells of a story of never-ending love,
That shines eternal in the moon's soft light.

As I listen to this magical song,
My heart is filled with a sense of peace,
And I know that I belong,
To this world of dreams and beauty that will never cease.

So let the wind carry me away,
To the world of dreams and pure delight,
And let me dance beneath the moon's soft sway,
Beneath the starry sky's shimmering light.",1
"Pain, oh pain, you invisible foe
Creeping up on me, oh so slow
You grip my heart, you grip my soul
And leave me feeling far from whole

You seep into my bones and flesh
Leaving me feeling like a mess
An ache that never seems to end
A wound that never quite can mend

But through it all, I stand upright
Leaning on strength, with all my might
For pain may shake me, but not break me
It may hurt me, but it can't take me

For I am more than just this pain 
I am not just my ache and strain
I am a fighter, always strong
Braving the storms, all day long

So bring your pain, oh bring it near
For I will face it without fear
With courage planted deep within
I'll rise above this pain again.",1

Its serenity lures me into the night
I feel his warm embrace, so tight
My heart beating, everything feels right

Together we dance in rhythmic pace
Our steps following the moon's grace
Whispers of love, his lips do trace
A feeling of euphoria, I can't replace

The night sky watching our love unfurl
His eyes, a reflection of a perfect pearl
We share a love that makes all else swirl
A bond so strong, it can never unfurl

In the moonlight, we become one
Our love blooming, like a flower in the sun
A love so pure, our souls brightly shone
In each other's embrace, we've finally won.",1
"It is 12:10 in New York and I am wondering
if I will finish this in time to meet Norman for lunch
ah lunch! I think I am going crazy
what with my terrible hangover and the weekend coming up
at excitement-prone Kenneth Koch's

but it is good to be several floors up in the dead of night
wondering whether you are any good or not

I wish I weren't reeling at all

Echoes through the stillness of the night
The melody of peace, a soothing remedy
For a world shrouded in darkness and blight

Carries a tune of hope and consolation
As the nightingale sings, the notes linger
And all worries dissipate in jubilation

The rustle of the leaves, a calming rhythm
A lullaby that rocks the restless soul

Of colors that heal and make us whole

In its tenderness, find your solace
And in every note, may you renew
Your strength to face life's constant menace.",1
"I once believed a lie so deep,
It kept me up at night to weep.
I let it consume my every thought,
Believing it was true, as if it were taught.

It said that love was just a game,
A way to win fortune and fame.
That people never truly care,
And trust is something you can't share.

I carried this lie close to my chest,
Thinking it was just for the best.
But the pain it brought me day by day,
Made me realize I was astray.

So I let go of that toxic tale,
And embraced what I knew to be real.
Love is not a game to play,
It's a feeling that guides the way.

Trust and care are not weak,
They make our connections peak.
The lie I believed was just a test,
A reminder to always love and be blessed.",1

Their feet planted on solid ground,
With views that leave us all spellbound.

A test of strength, a climb so rough,
But those who make it to the peak,
Are filled with pride, their hearts do speak.

For all the struggles that they faced,
The doubts and fears they had to chase,
Were worth it for the sweet reward,
The sense of achievement, they’ve scored.

And though the path was never clear,
And obstacles would oft appear,
These mountaineers would persevere,
Until their goal was finally near.

So here’s to those who climb so high,
Who strive for greatness to defy,
The odds that say they can’t complete,
An achievement that’s truly sweet.",1

A tranquil world, its own time and space.
I wander beneath the old, wise trees,
Each one a guard and every breeze
A voice of a story that history weaves.

A hidden shelter from city noise,
A sanctuary of purest joys,
The rustle of leaves, the hum of the earth,
All speak of the secrets of the woods' worth.

The damp earth beneath my feet,
Alive with roots and freshly beets,
The crisp air fills my lungs with life,
All trace of worry, all trace of strife,
Vanish within this forest's hushed veil.

The birds flit and hop their way,
Among the branches, a joyful play
Of music that soothes the troubled soul
And heals the heart, making one whole.

The forest is my natural altar,
A holy place, where I come to alter
My thoughts, my behaviors, my very being,
Communing with nature, and just breathing
The calm that flows from this hallowed ground.

Thanks, oh forest, for this perfect spot,
Where I can be me, where I feel I've got
A place in this world, among the trees
Where life's burdens lie at their knees,
And I am free, to feel alive, and not be caught.",1

Painting the world in fiery hues
A symphony of colors, a vibrant tease
As nature prepares for its winter blues

The trees let go, with a gentle sigh
As leaves fall and float on the wind
A graceful dance, with no reason why
But beauty in its every spin

The sun shines bright, a warm embrace
As golden leaves rustle and sway
A moment of magic, a fleeting grace
A memory to cherish and replay

In this season of change, there's a peaceful rhythm
A time to slow down and enjoy
The golden leaves remind us of freedom
And the beauty that lies in letting go.",1

In a breathless, mesmerizing round.

From the depths of time and space,
A song of endless wonder and awe,
Echoes through the celestial maze,
In a magnificent, celestial draw.

The pulse of the stars beats as one,
In a mesmerizing, ethereal trance,
As they sing of time that's begun,
And reveal a universe's grand romance.

So listen to that symphony divine,
As the heavens above unfold,
And let your soul take flight and shine,
In the eternal stars' rhythmic mould.",1
"City life is a rush,
A never-ending storm.
Lights flash and buildings loom,
A skyline to adorn.

The streets are paved with people,
Rushing to and fro.
Cars honk and sirens blare,
As they come and go.

Tall buildings stand like giants,
Reaching for the sky above.
Separated by narrow canyons,
With bustling streets below.

The city never sleeps,
Always moving, always alive.
With people from all walks of life,
And stories to revive.

The sounds of the city are a symphony,
A blend of noise and song.
The rhythm of urban life,
That keeps us moving along.

The city skyline is majestic,
A sight to behold.
But it's the people that make it,
The city's heart and soul.

Despite the chaos and the rush,
The city has a charm.
A place where dreams are made,
And futures are formed.",1

Or any idea of divine geometric projection

A setting for the tomato
To form a medallion with a dab
Of mayonnaise as a fleuron.
And—as eclectic as this may sound—
If the mayonnaise can also be applied
Along the crust in a Vitruvian scroll
And as a festoon below the medallion,
That would be swell.

"An early sadness for the future
(as in dreams of myself young and sad)
accompanies my departure towards
a conventional story: a town
of girls a New York City dormitory.
And so a trail proceeds from
our house on the top of the hill
down the back way of former army barracks
and past the borrowed church (ours had no tank)
where I was baptized
reasoning “it must be true” out of
the love I had for my mother.
And Tony’s house there across the street from it
absolutely in the Mexican gully
in dreams of which he and I still fight armed enemies
he stepped on a land mine in Nam
when I remind my brother, twenty years after
his face contorts he knows the look of that death
a week before he himself dies
blood-tinged ruddy-winged, but that’s another
dream-site the Needles Cemetery inelegant
unbeautiful and dear and dry.
See how many loves, how much thus sadness
in the future begins to
haunt that walk down that hill
towards the highway away to the dormitory
as I go to New York to sever love’s connections
and make the “real ones” generated by
actual mating by beauty and clothes
the black wool suit with its three button jacket
the oddly puffed-sleeved orange sweater
and an orange and midnight-
blue paisley waistless dress.
New trail there,
Brett knows my future love though I don’t
hitchhikes with him to California
years before I catch up to the poets in Iowa City
that will be in ’69, my brother
hasn’t yet signed up for Nam then
when he gives me rattles off a rattler
which I keep in my wooden India box I still have
until they stink.
I can’t keep track of the track there’s nothing but
sidetrails of love and sadness so love is
all that makes my people act they go to war for love
you know, of who and what you are
like I was baptized by
the cruellest-lipped prissiest-mouthed man in the world
for love, but I could just have gone swimming
walked back up love’s hill
back up at the house you can get to the pool
barefoot if you can find enough
bush or telephone-pole shadows.
We’d all swim together
I’d tread water dreaming of the future
but a wilder larger eye birdlike
distant holds the pool in its pupil
anyone’s that too, and hold the enlarging
water sad how not be
why don’t the smart girls in New York know this
why don’t you or I know what we know
the eye and the water both enlarge still why don’t
smart girls in Paris, yes larger but will never flood
the containing eye, but why not
and sometimes it does
when you or your own are the news.",0

That makes life richer, fuller and queasier
For texture, dear texture, you hold the key

"I approached the luminous stranger who came to me
from darkness in a gown of lettuce leaves, in a velvet
cloak of green that appeared at first another piece of dark,
but pulled apart into the glow-sphere that danced
in swaying steps, the lucent majesty that slipped toward me
from the reigning silence black above my cage.
Oh extravagant—and were my teeth too sharp to greet
or sharp enough? I do not understand now what was meant
to happen and what was a mistake—but know the bursting,
the sickening snap of ecstasy wrenched back to the body
and the green gown flung in crippled circles traced
like diagrams of wasting moons above my head—or portals
to another world, I thought, but as I thought, the shriek
dissolved, the body crumpled from the air and landed
on its side beneath the salt lick. All night I tended
the wasted skin and careful, brought it water,
alfalfa, made a bed of cedar chips and tried to gather
molecules of breath that floated from the plant shelf.
When I remembered morning, I began to cry, began to pray
for night to stay until the green took shape again
and if that shape were gone, I prayed for night

"Verse 1:
Beyond what meets the naked eye,
Lies beauty that we can't deny,
The hidden gems that we can't see,
Are captivatingly enchanting to me.

Chorus:
The captivating beauty of the unseen,
A wondrous world that's yet to be seen,
Underneath the surface so serene,
It's a place where magic has been.

Verse 2:
The whispers of the gentle winds,
The shimmering lights that flicker within,
The rustle of the leaves in the breeze,
It's a symphony that only nature sees.

Chorus:
The captivating beauty of the unseen,
A wondrous world that's yet to be seen,
Underneath the surface so serene,
It's a place where magic has been.

Verse 3:
The dancing lights in the midnight sky,
The patterns they paint make me sigh,
The glow that shines within each soul,
Is more beautiful than any painting or scroll.

Chorus:
The captivating beauty of the unseen,
A wondrous world that's yet to be seen,
Underneath the surface so serene,
It's a place where magic has been.

Outro:
The beauty of the unseen is all around,
In every sight and every sound,

And cherish the beauty that lies within.",1
"Oh, how mysterious and lovely,
is the number thirteen.
A number so often feared,
yet so full of hidden beauty.

Thirteen witches in a coven,
thirteen steps to the gallows,
thirteen cards in a suit,
thirteen colonies in the land of the free.

But thirteen is not all bad luck,
It's a prime number, strong and true,
It's the number of lunar cycles,
in a year that is so new.

There are thirteen lines in a haiku,
thirteen notes in a baker's dozen,
thirteen stripes on our flag,
and thirteen letters in optimistic.

So let us not fear or condemn,
this number that is so grand,
for it is full of wonder and surprise,
this number that we call thirteen.",1
"Unless a grain of wheat goes into the ground and dies, it remains nothing but a grain of wheat.          —John 12:24
The ingredients gathered, a few small red tufts of the dream spoor per sheaf of Demeter’s blonde wheat, reaped in mourning, in silence, ground up with the pollen and mixed into white wine and honey. These stored forms of light taken under the ground. Taken by mouth. First those who by birth hold in secret the word; then placed on the tongues of the new ones, into whose ears it is meant to be whispered. Word murdered, forgotten so long ago, placed as a kiss on the lips of the soon-to-be-no-longer breathing who mean to enter death with open eyes, with mouths saying Death, what death? We have no word for it in our country where the bride of a brighter oblivion reigns. Not the purple-haired god but the child queen, the raped girl, come back from the dead hand in hand with the child she conceived there, returned in a resurrected virginity, wind through green wheat. Present-day site of a minor refinery in Christ. Although by the tenth generation already the children of light (“in their dark garments”) had trampled and smashed and generally raped the two thousand years of this precinct and its holy meal, intolerable mirror. Men who’d designed and bowed down to a law derived from the sayings of one who appeared here to say that the law is abolished, it is too late, all that is over with. Men who bungled their way through the next eighteen centuries before finally descending into the earth themselves, and what they found there they used, and we thank you for destroying the destroyers of the world. And here at the end this is as good as any other entrance to the underplace, journey of the fallen leaf back to the branch, to the bees of Eleusis among olive blossoms, untroubled among crimson wildflowers. Four thousand years later: same flowers, same bees.",0
"A fool I was to sleep at noon,
And wake when night is chilly
Beneath the comfortless cold moon;
A fool to pluck my rose too soon,
A fool to snap my lily.
My garden-plot I have not kept;
Faded and all-forsaken,
I weep as I have never wept:
Oh it was summer when I slept,
It's winter now I waken.
Talk what you please of future spring
And sun-warm'd sweet to-morrow:—
Stripp'd bare of hope and everything,
No more to laugh, no more to sing,

"The villain lurks in shadows deep,
A creature born to scheme and creep.
His heart is black as coal and tar,
And evil thoughts have left their scar.

He revels in his wicked game,
Taking pleasure in causing pain.
He cares not for the woes he sows,
In his heart, only darkness grows.

His twisted mind seeks to destroy,
The light of any hope or joy.
He revels in the misery he wrought,
Infernal flames are all he's got.

No one dares to face his wrath,
For the villain walks the devil's path.
His deeds are known, his name reviled,
His presence leaves us cold and chilled.

But though he thinks himself a king,
The villain's power cannot win.
For though he may leave chaos in his wake,
In time, his fate he can't escape.",1
"A moment cherished in my heart so deep,
Comes to me when I'm in my sleep.
A special time, oh so sweet,
A memory that cannot be beat.

A walk along a sandy shore,
With someone special, whom I adore.
The sunset painted orange and red,
And I felt so alive, not dead.

The salty breeze blew in my hair,
As we walked without a care.
Talking, laughing, holding hands,
We walked along the endless sands.

I stopped and turned, took a look,
A memory forever in my book.
The sun was setting, oh so slow,
That moment will forever glow.

The kiss that followed sealed the deal,
A moment that I'll always feel.
My cherished memory, forever mine,
The moment when that sun did shine.",1

for any poems that have been waiting.
The horizon opens as I walk,
escorted by swans and Canada geese.
I need to stop backpedaling into the present.
In my old life people would straighten
the truth, but the river
flows in curves.
The names of my father and my mother

Is marriage like owning a very expensive art piece?

From having less or from wanting more?

She wakes up knowing that she doesn’t want less.
From House of Cards she learned a new rule: “I love that
woman. I love her more than sharks love blood.”

Lao Tzu, where is your power to persuade a tree from falling

Does night dream of actresses sleeping on leaves?
Where is the human figure in this?
Your Saturday is a memory without a body.
A pair of lungs that knew too much about your mother’s rape
tells you to leave reality through a threshold of a dream.
You knew how to be authentic. How to get rid of people.
How desertion works in the wilderness.
You exclude sound from your thesis.
It’s a way for you to desert poetry without being too poetic.

Shape-shifting as the wind's arranging,
From delicate whiteness to gray,
Its mood and color can sway.

Sometimes it's puffy and round,
Other times it's stretched on the ground,
Silver linings and shadows greet,
A heavenly view of nature's feat.

In summer, it provides a shade,
A respite from the sun's harsh blade,
In winter, it hides the stars,
A soft blanket for our planet's scars.

Cloud, oh how you make my heart sing,
A symbol of imagination's wing,
A muse for dreams and fantasies,
A bridge to the heavens, and all its entities.",1

The anchor of our soul
The source of all that we believe in
And the goal that makes us whole

It is the wisdom that we seek

And in its shining brilliance
We find the answers that we need

And let it be our guide

That in our hearts resides.",1

I wanted to write an epic about suffering,
but when I found a tendril
of her hair among the ruins
of her mud house,
I found my epic there.2
I didn’t sleep last night.
As if the night
were hiding in the morning coffee.3
Her life is a game of snakes and ladders
sent relentlessly back to square one,
but whose life isn’t? She takes a breath
and throws the dice again.4
The city glitters below
the airplane window, not because
of the bones and skulls scattered
under the sun, but the view
through the frosted breather hole.5
She died, and time changed
for those she loved most,
but her watch kept ticking.6
A god carried the burdens
until the weight persuaded him
to transfer them to man —
the new suffering god.7
The map of Iraq looks like a mitten,
and so does the map of Michigan —
a match I made by chance.8
If you can’t save people,
at least don’t hate them.9
Her bubbling annoys me —
can’t understand a word she says.
So what if I toss her from the aquarium?
So what if I spill her new world
with this nasty immigrant fish!10
The city’s innumerable lights
turning on and off remind us
we are born to arrive,
as we are born to leave.11
The handkerchiefs are theirs,
but the tears are ours.12

Behind them, stars falling from the sky.13

The homeless are not afraid
to miss something.
What passes through their eyes
is how the clouds pass over the rushing cars,
the way pigeons miss some of the seeds
on the road and move away.
Yet only they know
what it means to have a home
and to return to it.18
The wind and rain
don’t discriminate
in buffeting us.
We are equal
in the eyes of the storm.19
When I was broken into fragments,
you puzzled me
back together
piece by piece.
I no longer fear
being broken
in any moment.20
Freezing in the mountains
without blankets or food,
and all they heard wasno news is good news.21
Their stories didn’t kill me
but I would die if I didn’t
tell them to you.22
Before killing them
they collected their personal effects.
Their cell phones are all ringing
in the box.23
We are not upset when
the grass dies. We know
it will come back
in a season or two.
The dead don’t come back
but they appear every time

That a circle has no beginning

"Why not write something for those
who scratched out improbable livings here?
Someone has managed to sow
This broken field with stones, it appears,
So someone’s scratching it still,
Although that Japanese knotweed has edged
The tilth. Two wasps in the child
Attempt to catch sun on a rail of the bridge.
The old local doctor has passed
At almost a full decade past ninety.
He never seemed depressed.
Seventy now, if barely,
I consider the field again:
Someone will drag these rocks away
But they’ll be back. The air smells like rain,
Which is fine, the summer’s been much too dry.
Nothing is left of the barn
But some rusty steel straps in some nasty red osier.
The stone fence still looks sound,
But even there the knotweed steps over.
Hadn’t I pledged an elegy
To the old ones who worked here? You couldn’t claim
They thrived, exactly, but maybe
They likewise scented good wind full of rain,
Lifted eyes above this old orchard
To the cloud-darkened hills and found their support
Somehow, somewhere. No matter,
They kept going until they could go no more.
The trees’ puckered apples have gathered
A flock of birds, and as they alight,
They’re full of unseasonable chatter,
As if to say that all will be right.
The old ones I promised a poem
Must have said it too. It’ll be all right.
I never knew them. They’re gone.
I say it out loud, It’ll be all right.

As I struggle with my own threat.

Its scales gleam in the dim light,
Sending shivers down my spine in fright,
I cannot look away from its gaze,
Its presence a haunting, endless maze.

I try to swim away, but alas,
It follows me, with steady grace,
My fear only fuels its desire,
To catch me with its jaws afire.

This fish, it seems, will never rest,
Until I am its helpless guest,
And so I flee, with all my might,
Away from this thing that haunts my night.

"Change is an elusive wave
It haunts, it inspires, it saves
It carries us through a sea of time
And leads us to worlds, both sublime and divine

Change is the wind that shifts our sails
It whispers, it pulls, it propels
It takes us from familiar shores
And opens up new horizons and doors

Change is the flame that ignites our souls
It burns, it transforms, it controls
It reveals our strengths and weaknesses alike
And sets us on a path towards our true self-like

Change is the seed that grows within
It sprouts, it blooms, it wins
It transforms our thoughts and feelings deep
And grants us a new outlook to keep

Change is the rhythm of life’s dance
It moves, it flows, it takes a chance
It creates a symphony of destiny
And shows us the world’s true complexity

"Ugliness, oh how unkind,
A mark upon the face and mind.
A label we give to those we see,
A weight to bear, an identity.

But who decides what is beauty?
A societal norm, a fleeting duty.
Is it not in the eye of the beholder?
A subjective view, a personal folder.

For what is deemed grotesque to one,
May be a masterpiece to some.
An imperfect flower, a broken vase,
Can still hold beauty in its embrace.

So let us not be quick to judge,
Or turn away with a cold, hard nudge.
For ugliness may just be a facade,
And beneath it lies a beauty, flawed.

Let us see with eyes anew,
And find the beauty, pure and true.
For in the world there is much to behold,
Even in the ugliness, a story untold.",1

The brightly-painted horse
Had a boy’s face,
And four small wheels
Under his feet,
Plus a long string
To pull him by this way and that
Across the floor,
Should you care to.
A string in-waiting
That slipped away
In many wiles
From each and every try.

Knock and they’ll answer,
Mother told me.
So I climbed four flights of stairs
And went in unannounced.
And found a small wooden toy
For the taking
In the ensuing emptiness
And the fading daylight
That still gives me a shudder
As if I held the key to mysteries in my hand.

Where’s the Lost and Found Department,
And the quiet entry,
The undeveloped film
Of the few clear moments
Of our blurred lives?
Where’s the drop of blood
And the teeny nail
That pricked my finger
As I bent down to touch the toy
And caught its eye?

Evening light,
Make me a Sunday
Go-to meeting shadow
For my toy.
My dearest memories are
Steep stair-wells
In dusty buildings
On dead-end streets,
Where I talk to the walls
And closed doors
As if they understood me.

The wooden toy sitting pretty.
No, quieter than that.

Raised by a villain
In a silent movie.Psst, someone said behind my back.",0
"They said I got away in a boat
And humbled me at the inquiry. I tell you
I sank as far that night as any
Hero. As I sat shivering on the dark water
I turned to ice to hear my costly
Life go thundering down in a pandemonium of
Prams, pianos, sideboards, winches,
Boilers bursting and shredded ragtime. Now I hide
In a lonely house behind the sea
Where the tide leaves broken toys and hatboxes
Silently at my door. The showers of
April, flowers of May mean nothing to me, nor the
Late light of June, when my gardener
Describes to strangers how the old man stays in bed
On seaward mornings after nights of
Wind, takes his cocaine and will see no one. Then it is
I drown again with all those dim
Lost faces I never understood, my poor soul
Screams out in the starlight, heart
Breaks loose and rolls down like a stone.
Include me in your lamentations.",0

"That night we drank warm whiskey
in our parked car
beyond woods now lost to the suburbs,
I fell in love with you.
What waited was the war
like a bloody curtain,
and a righteous moment
when the lovely boy’s
spine was snapped,
then the long falling into hell.
But lately, you’ve been calling me
back through the years of bitter silence
to tell me of another river of blood
and of the highland’s
howl at dusk of human voices
blasted into ecstasy.
That night in sweet Lorain

"I’d given up hope. Hadn’t eaten in three
days. Resigned to being wolf meat ...
when, unbelievably, I found myself in
a clearing. Two goats with bells
round their necks stared at me:
their pupils like coin slots
in piggy banks. I could have gotten
the truth out of those two,
if goats spoke. I saw leeks
and radishes planted in rows;
wash billowing on a clothesline ...
and the innocuous-looking cottage
in the woods with its lapping tongue
of a welcome mat slurped me in.
In the kitchen, a woman so old her sex
is barely discernible pours a glass
of fraudulent milk. I’m so hungry
my hand shakes. But what is this liquid?
“Drink up, sweetheart,” she says,
and as I wipe the white mustache
off with the back of my hand:
“Atta girl.” Have I stumbled
into the clutches of St. Somebody?
Who can tell. “You’ll find I prevail here
in my own little kingdom,” she says as
she leads me upstairs—her bony grip
on my arm a proclamation of ownership,
as though I've always been hers.",0

"All hail to the Rev. George Gilfillan of Dundee, He is the greatest preacher I did ever hear or see. He is a man of genius bright, And in him his congregation does delight, Because they find him to be honest and plain, Affable in temper, and seldom known to complain. He preaches in a plain straightforward way, The people flock to hear him night and day, And hundreds from the doors are often turn’d away, Because he is the greatest preacher of the present day. He has written the life of Sir Walter Scott, And while he lives he will never be forgot, Nor when he is dead, Because by his admirers it will be often read; And fill their minds with wonder and delight, And wile away the tedious hours on a cold winter’s night. He has also written about the Bards of the Bible, Which occupied nearly three years in which he was not idle, Because when he sits down to write he does it with might and main, And to get an interview with him it would be almost vain, And in that he is always right, For the Bible tells us whatever your hands findeth to do, Do it with all your might. Rev. George Gilfillan of Dundee, I must conclude my muse, And to write in praise of thee my pen does not refuse, Nor does it give me pain to tell the world fearlessly, that when You are dead they shall not look upon your like again.",0
"Hate is a flame that burns so bright,
A poison that eats at the soul like a blight.
It twists and turns in a wicked dance,
And leaves destruction in its every chance.

It grows and festers deep within,
An endless pit of anger and sin.
It thrives on pain and suffering,
And leaves behind a world so utterly suffocating.

It blinds us to the beauty that surrounds,
A darkness that envelopes and astounds.
It feeds on envy, greed, and jealousy,
And leaves behind a trail of misery.

Hate is a weapon we wield with ease,
A tool of destruction that no one can appease.
It drives us to do unspeakable things,
And leaves behind a trail of ruin and bling.

So let us reject this terrible fate,
And strive instead for love and not hate.
Let us celebrate difference and diversity,
And live in harmony with peace and prosperity.",1
"Pretentious Art

Oh, how art loves to be pretentious
With meaning hidden in deep recesses,
A cryptic message only few can perceive
Leaving the rest of us to simply believe.

Wrapped in symbolism and abstraction
Art tries to be more than a mere distraction,
An elevated form of expression and thought,
But to most, it simply seems overwrought.

What happened to art that was accessible,
That spoke to the heart, and soul, and mindable?
When did it become a game for the elite,
An arrogant display of ostentatious conceit?

Perhaps art should remember its true purpose,
To inspire, to uplift, to make life more than surface,
Not to just be a snobbish, high-brow affair
But something that all can appreciate and share.

So let art drop its pretentious façade,
And once again become accessible, not odd,
A thing of beauty that's for everyone to see,
Not just a select few of the bourgeoisie.",1
"The heart's unsung melody 
Echoes through the night 
In the symphony of the soul's longing 
For love's sweet delight 

A stirring in the deepest parts 
Rises up like a tide 
The yearning for a love so pure 
It can't be denied 

The strings that pull our heart along 
Are harp strings in our chest 
Each note a plea for happiness 
That won't let us rest 

We search for love in countless ways 
But it always seems to flee 
As the symphony of the soul's longing 
Becomes our destiny 

We learn to live with broken hearts 
And hope that one sweet day 
We'll find the love we've been seeking 
In the symphony we play.",1
"Or is it on account of my radiant eye
I have lived so long?—I never slept
in the study hall, or called anyone
by an improper name. I never urinated in
a desolate synagogue. I never ate or drank
in a desolate synagogue or picked my teeth.
I did not walk into a desolate synagogue
in the summer just because of the heat,
nor in winter just because of cold rain.
Also, I know one may not deliver a eulogy
for an individual inside a desolate synagogue.
But you can read scripture inside a desolate
synagogue, or you can teach in a desolate
synagogue, or deliver eulogies for the community.
When synagogues are deserted they are
to be left alone and weeds allowed to grow.
One should not pick the weeds, lest there be
anguish that the synagogue is in ruins.
When are the synagogues to be swept
so that weeds do not grow inside them?
When they are in use.—When synagogues are
in ruins, weeds are not to be picked there.Because I know these things I was approved,
although unworthy, after a three-day oral
examination before the king of Sicily
to whom by custom the power of approval
is entrusted. Thereafter, I have worn the
laurel crown—my eye radiant to this day.",0
"A letter that remains unsent,
A message frozen in time,
Words that were never meant,
A confession that was a crime.

The paper sits empty,
A blank canvas of thought,
The words they were plenty,
But my heart they fought.

I wrote of my feelings,
Of secrets unshared,
Of desires revealing,
Of love, left unprepared.

But the courage to send,
The message never came,
And so it will end,
As a letter, just the same.

My words may never be read,
My love may never be known,
But in my heart, they'll be said,
In a space all their own.

So, here's to the letter unseen,
A message left unheard,
For it's love that's in between,
The lines, the ones blurred.",1
"Teaching is an art so true,
A passion to impart what's new,
A journey for both me and you,
A gift that comes from the heart so true.

In the beginning it may seem tough,
As students struggle with concepts rough,
But patience is key, and soon enough,
They'll grasp the lesson, and impress us with their stuff.

As a teacher, I strive to ignite,
A love of learning and a thirst to fight,
To find the answers, and soar in flight,
To think for themselves, and emerge in light.

A classroom is where we all come together,
To share ideas and learn how to weather,
Life's challenges, and find what we treasure,
To build a future of joy and pleasure.

I'm proud to have a role in this,
To guide, inspire, and watch them bliss,
As they grow up, and fulfill their wish,
To shine, to lead, to chase what they miss.

Teaching is an adventure every day,
A chance to make a difference, in a unique way,
I'm grateful, thankful, and blessed to say,
That teaching is my calling, come what may.",1

How I envy thee,
Flitting through the sky with ease,
And soaring wild and free.

Your wings they spread so vast and strong,
As you ride the currents high,
You seem to dance with joy and song,
Up where the eagles fly.

No worries of the world below,
No chains to hold you down,
You glide above the trees and flow,
So light and full of crown.

Oh, how I long to join your flight,
To feel your feathered might,
And leave behind my earthly plight,
For a life of pure delight.

But though I cannot soar like you,
I'll watch and marvel still,
At the beauty that you bring anew,
And the wonder that you fill.

For you remind me that there's more,
To life than what we see,
And in your flight I find a core,
Of hope and possibility.",1
"Oh, how I loathe them with every bite,  
The slimy texture and putrid sight.  
They come in cans or freshly picked,  
But their presence in my mouth makes me sick. 

Oh, how I cringe at the mere thought,  
Of their taste, that I have long fought.  
They're served in soups, salads, or alone,  
But to eat them, I'd rather be thrown. 

Oh, how I wish they'd disappear,  
From every plate, every menu, every year.  
But alas, they continue to exist,  
A food I hate, so reviled yet persist. 

So, keep them far away from me,  
These tiny bundling balls of misery.  
I'll stick to all my other favorites,  
And leave them behind, as they cause me so much distaste.",1

The love I held back, the thoughts in my head.  
I wish I had found the courage to speak,  
To let my heart out, to let my soul leak.  

But fear consumed me, the fear of rejection,  
So I kept my distance, stuck to reflection.  
My heart was heavy, with unspoken emotion,  
A burden I carried, a deep-seated notion.  

Now I see the cost of my hesitation,  
The loss of opportunity, the missed sensation.  
I wonder what could have been, what might await,  
If only I had dared to knock on love's gate.  

But time has passed, the door seems closed,  
And I'm left with my regret, my heart exposed.  
I pray that someone else may have the strength I lack,  
To take a chance, to never look back.  

For it's better to try and fail, than to never start,  
To live with regret, with a broken heart.  
So here I stand, a lesson to learn,  
To never let fear hold me back, to let my heart burn.",1

"Here, where the world is quiet;          Here, where all trouble seems Dead winds' and spent waves' riot          In doubtful dreams of dreams; I watch the green field growing For reaping folk and sowing, For harvest-time and mowing,          A sleepy world of streams. I am tired of tears and laughter,          And men that laugh and weep; Of what may come hereafter          For men that sow to reap: I am weary of days and hours, Blown buds of barren flowers, Desires and dreams and powers          And everything but sleep. Here life has death for neighbour,          And far from eye or ear Wan waves and wet winds labour,          Weak ships and spirits steer; They drive adrift, and whither They wot not who make thither; But no such winds blow hither,          And no such things grow here. No growth of moor or coppice,          No heather-flower or vine, But bloomless buds of poppies,          Green grapes of Proserpine, Pale beds of blowing rushes Where no leaf blooms or blushes Save this whereout she crushes          For dead men deadly wine. Pale, without name or number,          In fruitless fields of corn, They bow themselves and slumber          All night till light is born; And like a soul belated, In hell and heaven unmated, By cloud and mist abated          Comes out of darkness morn. Though one were strong as seven,          He too with death shall dwell, Nor wake with wings in heaven,          Nor weep for pains in hell; Though one were fair as roses, His beauty clouds and closes; And well though love reposes,          In the end it is not well. Pale, beyond porch and portal,          Crowned with calm leaves, she stands Who gathers all things mortal          With cold immortal hands; Her languid lips are sweeter Than love's who fears to greet her To men that mix and meet her          From many times and lands. She waits for each and other,          She waits for all men born; Forgets the earth her mother,             The life of fruits and corn; And spring and seed and swallow Take wing for her and follow Where summer song rings hollow          And flowers are put to scorn. There go the loves that wither,          The old loves with wearier wings; And all dead years draw thither,          And all disastrous things; Dead dreams of days forsaken, Blind buds that snows have shaken, Wild leaves that winds have taken,          Red strays of ruined springs. We are not sure of sorrow,          And joy was never sure; To-day will die to-morrow;          Time stoops to no man's lure; And love, grown faint and fretful, With lips but half regretful Sighs, and with eyes forgetful          Weeps that no loves endure. From too much love of living,          From hope and fear set free, We thank with brief thanksgiving          Whatever gods may be That no life lives for ever; That dead men rise up never; That even the weariest river          Winds somewhere safe to sea. Then star nor sun shall waken,          Nor any change of light: Nor sound of waters shaken,          Nor any sound or sight: Nor wintry leaves nor vernal, Nor days nor things diurnal; Only the sleep eternal          In an eternal night.",0

Mold and damp the face defile.

"Sorrow comes like a heavy cloud,
Draping over everything like a shroud,
A weight upon the heart it lays,
That only time can mend in ways. 

Tears fall like rain without end,
As we struggle to come to comprehend,
Why life can be so harsh and cruel,
Leaving us feeling like such a fool. 

Memories flood back without refrain,
Pangs of regret felt once again,
Wishing things could have been different,
But we can't escape the present. 

Like a shadow, sorrow follows us,
A constant undercurrent that rushes,
Through our veins, and in our mind,
A constant reminder of what we left behind. 

But sorrow is not meant to last,
Nor is it a punishment cast,
A lesson to be learned and endured,
So we can get up and be assured. 

Take comfort in the fact that, eventually,
Sorrow will give way to possibility,
A renewed spirit and a new hope,
As we climb up from the abyss, we cope. 

So let sorrow come, and let it go,
For in the end, it helps us grow,
Stronger, wiser, and ready to face,
Whatever the future may have in place.",1

"The human cylinders
Revolving in the enervating dusk
That wraps each closer in the mystery
Of singularity
Among the litter of a sunless afternoon
Having eaten without tasting
Talked without communion
And at least two of us
Loved a very little

To know if our two miseries
In the lucid rush-together of automatons
Could form one opulent wellbeing
Simplifications of men

Your indistinctness
Serves me the core of the kernel of you

Leaning brow to brow       communicative
Over the abyss of the potential
Concordance of respiration
Shames
Absence of corresponding between the verbal sensory
And reciprocity
Of conception
And expression
Where each extrudes beyond the tangible
One thin pale trail of speculation
From among us we have sent out
Into the enervating dusk
One little whining beast
Whose longing
Is to slink back to antediluvian burrow
And one elastic tentacle of intuition
To quiver among the stars

Routs      the polemic

Where imagination runs wild and free,
Where colors dance and stories intertwine,
A world of endless possibility.

Where the sun never sets and the moon persists,
And reality takes a hiatus.

"Childhood, oh childhood
A time of innocence and fun
Days spent exploring and playing
Under the warmth of the sun

Running barefoot through the grass
Laughing with joy, carefree and wild
Picking flowers, chasing butterflies
A world of adventure, like a child

Picnics in the park, splashing in the pool
Melting popsicles, summertime bliss
Building sandcastles, flying kites
The simple pleasures we all miss

Hide and seek, tag and hopscotch
Games played with friends day after day
Imagination always in full force
Every moment a chance to play

Childhood memories, like treasure
A time we all wish to go back
To that world of innocence and wonder
Where the only limit is your imagination's track

Oh childhood, how we cherish thee
A place of pure, unadulterated glee
Where life is a playground and everything's free
A time of happiness, forever to be.",1
"A black cat among roses, Phlox, lilac-misted under a first-quarter moon, The sweet smells of heliotrope and night-scented stock. The garden is very still,   It is dazed with moonlight, Contented with perfume, Dreaming the opium dreams of its folded poppies. Firefly lights open and vanish   High as the tip buds of the golden glow Low as the sweet alyssum flowers at my feet. Moon-shimmer on leaves and trellises, Moon-spikes shafting through the snow ball bush.   Only the little faces of the ladies’ delight are alert and staring, Only the cat, padding between the roses, Shakes a branch and breaks the chequered pattern As water is broken by the falling of a leaf. Then you come, And you are quiet like the garden, And white like the alyssum flowers,   And beautiful as the silent sparks of the fireflies. Ah, Beloved, do you see those orange lilies? They knew my mother, But who belonging to me will they know When I am gone.",0
"In the stillness of the night sky
A magic dance takes flight
A canvas of beauty unfolds
The Northern Lights ignite

Green, pink, and purple hues
Paint the starry expanse
A symphony of colors
In a cosmic romance

Spellbound, we watch in awe
As the ribbons dance and glow
A bewitching display of nature's art
That leaves us breathless and aglow

The sky becomes alive
With shimmering waves of light
In the Enchantment of the Northern Lights
Our souls take flight",1
"The Melodies of the Heart's Symphony

A symphony of emotions, the heart plays
A melody of love, joy, and praise
With every beat it sings a song
Of passions deep and memories long

In its music, we find a connection
A resonance with the soul's inception
For in the heart's symphony we hear
The echoes of life's hopes and fears

Each note a symbol of life's story
A cadence of pain, loss, and glory
Yet the melody remains a beautiful sound
In its harmonies, love is found

The heart's symphony is a melody of life
A tune that guides us through joys and strife
And though it may bring tears and sorrow
We know that it will play tomorrow

For the melodies of the heart's symphony 
Are timeless tunes of life's journey",1
"Onward through unknown depths,
I navigate this wondrous course.
Fathoming the mysteries that await,
Guided only by my inner force.

The winds of change may blow,
And tempests rage throughout the night.
Yet steadfast I shall be,
Until I bask in the dawn's light.

The song of my soul's voyage,
Echoes through every gale.
A melody that shall never fade,
Though storms may try to assail.

In the depths of the abyss,
Or atop the highest waves,
I know that I must press on,
Towards the horizon that calls and saves.

Thus, with each passing day,
My journey continues to unfold.
A story of courage and faith,
Of triumphs and lessons untold.

For the song of my soul's voyage,
Is a testament to the human heart.
A cherished and divine expression,
Of our capacity to chart.

So, let it soar through the tempest,
And resound through tranquil seas.
For the song of the soul's voyage,
Is a symphony of destiny.",1
"The pages turn, the story unfolds  
An adventure that never grows old  
Characters we meet, a world we explore  
A book is all that and so much more  

A tale of love, of loss, of fate  
A narrative that we can relate  
A mirror of life, of the joys and the strife  
A book that becomes a part of our life  

From cover to cover, we immerse and escape  
In worlds that are real, and ones that are fake  
We laugh, we cry, we feel every emotion  
A book is a journey, a magical potion  

The words are the paints, the pages a canvas  
A masterpiece created by an author's whims  
A book is a portal to endless possibilities  
A window to the wonders of the realities  

As we turn the last page, we sigh with regret  
That our journey has come to an end, and yet  
The memories and the lessons will always remain  
A book we read, again and again.",1

As the night falls still
Whispering secrets 
Only the night can reveal

In the silent darkness

Casting shadows 
With a mystical sight

Creates a peaceful ambiance 
As it whispers 
In the skies with elegance

Of secrets kept and dreams unfurled
In the hush of the quiet hours
We hear the whispers of the world

The stillness speaks in tones so soft
Of love and longing, loss and pain
In tales untold and memories aloft
Silence weaves a heartfelt refrain

From the rustle of leaves in the breeze
To the falling of snowflakes in the night
Silence carries, with such ease
The melodies of nature's delight

From the quiet of a peaceful dawn
To the stillness of a starry night
Silence sings a plaintive song
Of hope and wonder, dark and light

So listen close, sweet silence true
As it sings its ballads of life
For in its whispers, we find anew
The beauty in a world of strife.",1

A challenge looming over me like a wall.
I didn't think I could climb up so high,
And I wanted to give up with every try.

But I looked deep down, to my heart,
And found a strength waiting to start.
With each step up, I gained courage and will,
And the weight of the challenge started to thrill.

Every time I reached a new height,
I felt a sense of such pure delight,
And though the climb was tough and steep,
I knew this challenge I could keep.

In the end, I stood tall and proud,
Knowing that I had overcome the clouds,
And as I looked down, what did I see?
A challenge conquered, and the best of me.",1

Guiding travelers by your light.

"I once failed at something I tried
But it still brings a smile to my face
The memory of it I cannot hide
It's a failure I enjoy to embrace

I wanted to bake a cake so sweet
With layers of frosting and chocolatey treats
But instead of a masterpiece to eat
I ended up with a lumpy, doughy defeat

Despite the cake being a mess
I couldn't help but feel content
For I had tried my very best
And learning from failure is time well spent

So now whenever I see that cake
I don't see a failure, I see a win
For each attempt we undertake
Is a step towards our next beginning

For it's in our failures we grow
And learn the lessons they teach
So embrace your failures, let them show
They're not defeats, but a goal to reach.",1
"We need the ceremony of one another,
meals served, more love,
more handling of one another with love, less
casting out of those who are not
of our own household.
‘This turkey is either not cooked
enough or it’s tough.’
The culture is in late imperial decline.
The children don’t like dark meat or
pepper. They say the mother sometimes
deliberately puts pepper on the things
the grown-ups like better.
Less casting out of those in our own
household with whom we disagree.
The cat will not hear of cat food,

the big thrush taken from the cold

mine his, the intolerant bastard)

The cat has followed Hazard from his studio,
he looks mean. He upbraids
the innocent dog and
all of us, he casts us out.
‘There’s pepper in this gravy. We’re
supposed to eat dry turkey and you’ve
put pepper in the gravy.’
The meal is served, nevertheless
with felt love, some godless benediction.
The grown ones have wine after the other
bottle. They cast out a lot. ‘The dancers
this afternoon were, well, thinky,’
she says. She toys with her glass.
‘He is strictly a one-joke painter,’
he replies, ‘painted that one twenty
years ago and is still putting pepper
on it, ha hah. Finish your turkey
you two and leave a little gravy for someone else.’
The cat is taking notes against
his own household. He watches.
Hazard would like once to see
things with the cat’s eyes, flat.
Now it is time to go to bed. Hungry

they enjoyed such conversational topics
as Mozart, tobacco, and four.
“Today’s peach boasts rare fuzz,” said Ray.
Bird added, “My mind is whale.”
Mia forgot her songbooks, but Hugh
said, “Let me embrace you all.”
Ray Way snagged Homeagain by the lapel
and fastened on Home’s left blue eye,
Mia saw Home’s green right eye unanchor
and wander away for the sky.
Then Ray, he let go of Home’s lapel,
and Ray let go of his ire,
and Ray let go the floor with his feet
to hover a bit on the air.
Hours ticked while oars pulled
over Lake Eekoutaheart.
The pelicans kept to their quiet perusals
of fishes, where the ripples teased apart.
“Please heal my ruptured soul,” said Mia.
Ray cheered, “The half-life got lived.”
Thunder again, he just picked at his sweater
where the yarn and his arms unweaved.
“The sky, it must be adhesive,” said Mia,
“elsewise the pelicans would fall—”
Way, still floating, looked her cool in her eye:
“Feel my faulty heart: it’s full.”
“So tell me, do you wonder about the crackers
once you lock the pantry?”
“I know God when I wash my hands.”
“Nothing makes sense like entropy.”
“And the pelican, does it unloose its eggs
like snow, an unbreakable good?”
“And does love shape the snow to hope’s ellipses?
“Who warms the nest—who could?”
“What’s next when your own eyes won’t let you go?”
“But the clouds won’t let me fall.”

A melody so soothing and clear
It rustles the leaves on the trees
And carries the scent of the seas

It dances around, light as a feather
Moving things around, like a magical weather
It flows through the fields, through the hills
And sometimes even grants my wishes

The wind, it plays games with me
It lifts my hair, sets my soul free
It sings to me, a sweet lullaby
And fills my heart, with joy untied

It paints the skies, with colors so bright
Playing with clouds, with all its might
It's a wild thing, that rules the air
A carefree spirit, beyond compare

So whenever you feel lost and alone
Listen to the wind, let it guide you home
For it's a friend, so true and kind
And carries with it, peace of mind.",1

The sunlit rays dance on the floor.

I cherish each day’s little start,
Thanks to my garden – my sweetheart.

But my plants will still find a way to grow.

It may take time, but in the end,
Each bud awakens like a friend.

"—and he cried with a loud voice:
Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees—
(Revelation)
They are cutting down the great plane-trees at the end of the gardens.
For days there has been the grate of the saw, the swish of the branches as they fall,
The crash of the trunks, the rustle of trodden leaves,
With the ‘Whoops’ and the ‘Whoas,’ the loud common talk, the loud common laughs of the men, above it all.
I remember one evening of a long past Spring
Turning in at a gate, getting out of a cart, and finding a large dead rat in the mud of the drive.
I remember thinking: alive or dead, a rat was a god-forsaken thing,
But at least, in May, that even a rat should be alive.
The week’s work here is as good as done. There is just one bough
On the roped bole, in the fine grey rain,
Green and high
And lonely against the sky.
(Down now!—)
And but for that,
If an old dead rat
Did once, for a moment, unmake the Spring, I might never have thought of him again.
It is not for a moment the Spring is unmade to-day;
These were great trees, it was in them from root to stem:
When the men with the ‘Whoops’ and the ‘Whoas’ have carted the whole of the whispering loveliness away
Half the Spring, for me, will have gone with them.
It is going now, and my heart has been struck with the hearts of the planes;
Half my life it has beat with these, in the sun, in the rains,
In the March wind, the May breeze,
In the great gales that came over to them across the roofs from the great seas.
There was only a quiet rain when they were dying;
They must have heard the sparrows flying,
And the small creeping creatures in the earth where they were lying—
But I, all day, I heard an angel crying:
‘Hurt not the trees.’",0
"This day, whate'er the Fates decree, Shall still be kept with joy by me: This day then let us not be told, That you are sick, and I grown old; Nor think on our approaching ills, And talk of spectacles and pills. To-morrow will be time enough To hear such mortifying stuff. Yet, since from reason may be brought A better and more pleasing thought, Which can, in spite of all decays, Support a few remaining days: From not the gravest of divines Accept for once some serious lines.          Although we now can form no more Long schemes of life, as heretofore; Yet you, while time is running fast, Can look with joy on what is past.          Were future happiness and pain A mere contrivance of the brain, As atheists argue, to entice And fit their proselytes for vice; (The only comfort they propose, To have companions in their woes;) Grant this the case; yet sure 'tis hard That virtue, styl'd its own reward, And by all sages understood To be the chief of human good, Should, acting, die, nor leave behind Some lasting pleasure in the mind; Which by remembrance will assuage Grief, sickness, poverty, and age; And strongly shoot a radiant dart To shine through life's declining part.          Say, Stella, feel you no content, Reflecting on a life well spent? Your skilful hand employ'd to save Despairing wretches from the grave; And then supporting with your store Those whom you dragg'd from death before? So Providence on mortals waits, Preserving what it first creates. Your gen'rous boldness to defend An innocent and absent friend; That courage which can make you just To merit humbled in the dust; The detestation you express For vice in all its glitt'ring dress; That patience under torturing pain, Where stubborn stoics would complain: Must these like empty shadows pass, Or forms reflected from a glass? Or mere chimæras in the mind, That fly, and leave no marks behind? Does not the body thrive and grow By food of twenty years ago? And, had it not been still supplied, It must a thousand times have died. Then who with reason can maintain That no effects of food remain? And is not virtue in mankind The nutriment that feeds the mind; Upheld by each good action past, And still continued by the last? Then, who with reason can pretend That all effects of virtue end?          Believe me, Stella, when you show That true contempt for things below, Nor prize your life for other ends, Than merely to oblige your friends; Your former actions claim their part, And join to fortify your heart. For Virtue, in her daily race, Like Janus, bears a double face; Looks back with joy where she has gone And therefore goes with courage on: She at your sickly couch will wait, And guide you to a better state.          O then, whatever Heav'n intends, Take pity on your pitying friends! Nor let your ills affect your mind, To fancy they can be unkind. Me, surely me, you ought to spare, Who gladly would your suff'rings share; Or give my scrap of life to you, And think it far beneath your due; You, to whose care so oft I owe That I'm alive to tell you so.",0
"In the stillness of the night,
My dream takes flight and comes to light.
It's a labyrinth of hidden clues,
A journey for my soul to peruse.

At first, I saw a castle grand,
With towers high and walls so grand.
Inside, I felt safe and secure,
Protected by the gates and allure.

Next, a storm began to brew,
And the sky turned a murky hue.
The castle walls began to crumble,
And I felt my peace start to stumble.

But then, a seedling caught my eye,
A tiny plant, so frail and shy.
It grew quickly, reaching for the sun,
Bathing in the light of everyone.

The storm began to fade away,
And with it, my doubts and dismay.
The seedling bloomed into a tree,
A symbol of hope, resilience, and me.

My dream revealed my deepest fears,
Yet offered comfort, wiped away tears.
It showed me that in times of strife,
I'll emerge stronger, and find new life.",1

Sometimes when I’m passing by her room she calls on me to step between them and resolve their disputes. (A little while ago I came to the aid of a historian called Kamal Salibi, whose forehead had been split open by a Catholic stone.)
What a diligent reader she is when she’s searching for Jesus, this woman I never failed to disappoint: I was not martyred in the first intifada, nor in the second, nor in the third. And just between you and me, I won’t be martyred in any future intifada either, nor will  I be killed by some booby-trapped stork.

As I take a bite into its sweet, juicy flesh.
The softness of a baby's cheek,
As I nuzzle in to get a little peck.

The milky, creamy texture of cheese,
As it melts in my mouth and excites my senses.
The cozy warmth of a cashmere sweater,
As I snuggle up in it and close my eyes.

These textures and more, bring comfort and delight,
Stimulate my mind, and awaken my sight.

"We have been cruising, half a block
at a time, my wife, my two children,
all morning, and I have been pointing out
unhurriedly and with some feeling
places of consequence, sacred places,
backyards, lush fields, garages, alleyways.
“There,” I say, “by this big cottonwood,
That’s where I dropped the fly ball, 1959.”
“And in 1961,” I say, “at this very corner,
Barry Sapolsky tripped me up with his gym bag.”
My son has fallen asleep, my daughter

and Janice Lehman walked in beauty.

of importance happened,” and I am pulling out
from under the car seat a photo album
of old school pictures, “Page 8,” I say,
“Fred Decker, John Carlson by the bike rack,
Mr. Burkett … ,” and driving on, following
the invisible map before my eyes.
Now we are drifting toward my boyhood house
and I am showing my wife trellised porches,
bike routes, more than she’d care to see;
“Why this longing?” she says, “What about now,
the kids, our lives together, lunch, me?”
I give her a kiss and turn right on Cherry
and there in front of our eyes, barely changed,
is the house where all my memories converge.
“Look at the windows of my room,” I say,
“see, there, the shadowy figure moving behind them?”
And before anyone can hope to answer,
I have grabbed my camera, I am snapping
pictures through the windshield, bricks,
dormers, railings, fences, streets, all
are falling thrall to my aim.
“We could be happy here,” I say, putting
another roll of film in and beginning
to nose my car toward Bill Corson’s house.
“Really, Daddy,” my daughter says; “No chance,”
my wife tacks on, but all I’m hearing
is the crack of bats in the neighborhood lot
and Danny’s pearl-handled cap gun going off
and the drone of bees around honeysuckle
and Dewey Waugh’s gravelly voice
urging on his mower, and the sound
of wind in the cottonwoods is like water,
I am coasting, there is time for everything.",0

"Shape,
An essence of form.
A sight to behold,
Intrinsic value to perform.

Circle, square, triangle,
Each has its place and grace.
Oh, their symmetry,
A treat to embrace.

The sun's roundness,
The earth's elliptical shape,
The moon's perfectness,
A beauty we can't escape.

From clay to paper,
Shapes take over.
Sculptures and paintings,
A world to discover.

Shape transcends boundaries,
A language understood.
Its allure and fascination,
A voice for the good.

Shape, a symbol of creativity,
Of imagination and design.
An enigma to unravel,
An element to define.

In shape, we find solace,
In shape, we find meaning.
In shape, we discover,
A whole new kind of feeling.

So here's to shape,
A marvel we can't ignore.
A sight to cherish,
Forever and more.",1

"i                                              The Story
of him who knew the most of all men know;
who made the journey; heartbroken; reconciled;
who knew the way things were before the Flood,
the secret things, the mystery; who went
to the end of the earth, and over; who returned,
and wrote the story on a tablet of stone.
He built Uruk. He built the keeping place
of Anu and Ishtar. The outer wall
shines in the sun like brightest copper; the inner
wall is beyond the imagining of kings.
Study the brickwork, study the fortification;
climb the great ancient staircase to the terrace;
study how it is made; from the terrace see
the planted and fallow fields, the ponds and orchards.
This is Uruk, the city of Gilgamesh
the Wild Ox, son of Lugalbanda, son
of the Lady Wildcow Ninsun, Gilgamesh
the vanguard and the rear guard of the army,
Shadow of Darkness over the enemy field,
the Web, the Flood that rises to wash away
the walls of alien cities, Gilgamesh
the strongest one of all, the perfect, the terror.
It is he who opened passes through the mountains;
and he who dug deep wells on the mountainsides;
who measured the world; and sought out Utnapishtim
beyond the world; it is he who restored the shrines;
two-thirds a god, one-third a man, the king.
Go to the temple of Anu and Ishtar:
open the copper chest with the iron locks;
the tablet of lapis lazuli tells the story.                                                    ii
There was no withstanding the aura or power of the Wild
Ox Gilgamesh. Neither the father's son
nor the wife of the noble; neither the mother's daughter
nor the warrior's bride was safe. The old men said:
""Is this the shepherd of the people? Is this
the wise shepherd, protector of the people?""
The gods of heaven listened to their complaint.
""Aruru is the maker of this king.
Neither the father's son nor the wife of the noble
is safe in Uruk; neither the mother's daughter
nor the warrior's bride is safe. The old men say:
'Is this the shepherd of the people? Is this
the wise shepherd, protector of the people?
There is no withstanding the desire of the Wild Ox.' ""
They called the goddess Aruru, saying to her:
""You made this man. Now create another.
Create his double and let the two contend.
Let stormy heart contend with stormy heart
that peace may come to Uruk once again.""
Aruru listened and heard and then created
out of earth clay and divine spittle the double,
the stormy-hearted other, Enkidu,
the hairy-bodied wild man of the grasslands,
powerful as Ninurta the god of war,
the hair of his head like the grain fields of the goddess,
naked as Sumuqan the god of cattle.
He feeds upon the grasslands with gazelles;
visits the watering places with the creatures
whose hearts delight, as his delights, in water.
iii
One day a hunter came to a watering place
and saw Enkidu; he stood expressionless,
astonished; then with his silent dogs he went
home to his father's house, fear in his belly.
His face was as one estranged from what he knows.
He opened his mouth and said to his father: ""Father,
I saw a hairy-bodied man today
at the watering place, powerful as Ninurta
the god of war; he feeds upon the grasslands
with gazelles; he visits the watering places
with the beasts; he has unset my traps and filled
my hunting pits; the creatures of the grasslands
get away free. The wild man sets them free.
Because of him I am no longer a hunter.""
His father said: ""Go to Uruk and there
present yourself to Gilgamesh the king,
who is the strongest of all, the perfect, the terror,
the wise shepherd, protector of the people.
Tell him about the power of the wild man.
Ask him to send a harlot back with you,
a temple prostitute, to conquer him
with her greater power. When he visits the watering place,
let her show him her breasts, her beauty, for his wonder.
He will lie with her in pleasure, and then the creatures,
the gazelles with whom he feeds upon the grasslands,
and the others with whom he visits the watering places,
will flee from him who ranged the hills with them.""
So the hunter went to Gilgamesh in Uruk
and told him about the power of the wild man,
and how he had unset the traps and filled
the pits, so that the creatures got away free.
The lord of Uruk said to the hunter then:
""When you return, a temple prostitute
will go with you and with her beauty conquer
the wild man. He will lie with her and then
the gazelles with whom he feeds upon the grasslands,
and the others with whom he visits the watering places,
will flee from him who ranged the hills with them.""                                                   iv
The harlot and the hunter traveled together,
taking three days, back to the watering place.
For three more days they waited, and finally
Enkidu came with the creatures that love the water,
the gazelles and the others, so as to drink their fill.
The temple prostitute looked at him, Enkidu,
the hairy-bodied wild man of the grasslands,
the hair of his head like the grain fields of the goddess,
naked as Sumuqan the god of cattle.
""That is Enkidu, Shamhat, show him your breasts,
show him your beauty. Spread out your cloak on the ground.
Lie down on it. The wild man will look at you.
Show him your body. The hairy-bodied man
will come to you and lie down on you; and then
show him the things a woman knows how to do.
The gazelles and with them all the other creatures
will flee from him who ranged the hills with them.""
And so the harlot, Shamhat, showed him her breasts,
showed him her body. The hairy-bodied man
came over to her, and lay down on her, and then
she showed him the things a woman knows how to do.
For seven days Enkidu in his wonder
lay with her in pleasure, and then at last
went to seek out the company of the creatures
whose hearts delight in feeding upon the grasslands,
and visiting the watering places, and
ranging the hills. But seeing him, they fled.
The creatures were gone, and everything was changed.
His body that loved to range the hills was now
unable to follow; but in the mind of the wild man
there was beginning a new understanding.
Bewildered, he turned, and sought out the company
of the temple prostitute. He sat down beside her,
and looked into her face, and listened to her:
""Enkidu, now you are beautiful as a god.
Why do you seek the company of beasts?
Come with me to the city, to Uruk,
to the temple of Anu and the goddess Ishtar.
Gilgamesh is the ruler, the strongest of all,
the terror. The aura and power of his desire
can be withstood by no one."" Then Enkidu,
whose heart was beginning to know about itself
and longed for a companion, cried aloud:
""Take me to Uruk, the city of Gilgamesh,
whose aura and power cannot be withstood.
I will cry out in Uruk, challenging him:
'It is I, Enkidu. The strength of the wild man
born in the wilderness cannot be withstood.' ""
The temple prostitute replied: ""Come then
to Uruk, where the processions are, and music,
and let us go together through the dancing
to the palace hall where Gilgamesh presides,
the favorite of the gods, the beautiful,
strongest of all, the terror, the most desired.
Look at his radiant face, the favorite
of Shamash and Enlil, Ea, and Anu.
While you were grazing beastlike with gazelles,
before your mind had any understanding,
his mind, a gift to the gifted of the gods,
had a dream of you before you knew of him.
In the early morning Gilgamesh arose
and told his mother his dream: 'I had a dream.
A star fell from the heavens, a meteorite,
and lay on the empty plain outside Uruk.
The men and women came and wondered at it.
I strove with it to lift it but could not.
I was drawn to it as if it was a woman.'
All-knowing Rimat-Ninsun spoke to him,
the lord of Uruk, Gilgamesh. His mother,
All-knowing Rimat-Ninsun, spoke and said:
""The star that fell from the heavens, the meteorite
that lay on the empty plain outside Uruk,
the star you could not lift when you strove with it,
the star you were drawn to as if drawn to a woman,
is the strong companion, powerful as a star,
the meteorite of the heavens, a gift of the gods.
That you were drawn to it as if drawn to a woman
means that this companion will not forsake you.
He will protect and guard you with his life.
This is the fortunate meaning of your dream.'
Then Gilgamesh the lord of Uruk said:
'May the dream as you interpret come to pass.' ""
The temple prostitute thus told the tale.",0
"Fear, a looming shadow cast
A chilling wind that sweeps us past
To fall into a deep abyss
And be consumed by endless wisps

It creeps into our every thought
A phantom that cannot be fought
A voice that whispers in our ear
Promising nothing but despair

We turn away and try to flee
But fear is always there to see
A constant presence, never gone
A reminder that we are not strong

It drags us down, it weighs us low
A burden we cannot overthrow
But still, we try to persevere
Knowing that fear will always be near

Yet in the end, we must concede
That fear is just a part of need
A primal instinct, deep inside
A force that makes us stay alive

So let us not be overawed
By fear’s relentless, endless claw
For in its grip we can still find
A strength that keeps us one step behind.",1
"Friendship, oh friendship
A bond that will never end
A connection beyond words
A love that always transcends

A comforting presence in life
A heart that understands

We shared our dreams and desires
And cheered each other on
Through failures and successes
Our friendship has only grown

Oh, the joy of true friendship
A treasure beyond measure
A gift that keeps on giving
A bond that will last forever

So here's to all my dear friends
My heart swells with pride
For in this journey of life
You've been my constant guide.",1
"Mushroom

Oh, little mushroom on the ground
What secrets do you hold?
With colors that are quite profound
And patterns quite bold

You seem to have a magic spell
That draws us to your side
With the promise of a story
That we can't help but abide

Perhaps you're not the prettiest
Or the biggest of them all
But there's something so intriguing
About your lowly crawl

So little mushroom on the ground
I'll keep my eyes on you
And follow wherever you may bound
To learn what you can do


Rock

Oh, rocky wonder in my hand
How old, how wise you must be
Your history we may never understand
But I admire what I can see

You have endured through time and space
Through forces of wind and tide
With a toughness that I could not replace
And a beauty that won't hide

Your rough exterior reveals
A story of your own
That took us many geological years
To capture and known

Your colors and your texture
Speak to me of age and growth
A stunning art of nature
That I could never boast

Oh, rocky wonder in my hand
I hold you carefully
For you are a precious land
And a gift to me.",1

"Art is a mysterious force,
An expression of the soul,
A language spoken without words,
A masterpiece that makes us whole.

With brush and paint, canvas and clay,
Artists bring their visions to life,
Creating a world of marvels and magic,

Art breathes life into the mundane,
It tells stories that words cannot say,

And takes our breath away.

"I once was lost in wilderness,
With no one to guide my way,
But a skill I learned, my savior,
Showed me light amidst the gray.

I learned to read the stars above,
To find my path at darkest night,
To navigate the winding road,
And find my way with all my might.

With each step, I gained more knowledge,
As the wild terrain unfurled,
I felt empowered and alive,
As I learned to conquer the world.

Now I wander with confidence,
Through mountains, meadows, and sea,
Thanks to the skill I learned,
That set my wandering spirit free.

So if you're lost and feeling lost,
Don't despair, just take a breath,
For with a little practice,
You too can find your way and rest.

So let your heart and mind be open,
To the power of a skill well-learned,

That takes you to places yet unturned.",1

It surrounds us, envelops us
Like a blanket of sound that never ends
Honking cars, blaring music, and buzzing crowds

Noise is the drumbeat of our days
The rhythm of the city, the beat of our hearts
It is the symphony of life in motion
The orchestra of chaos and order

Sometimes noise can be comforting
The sound of rain on a rooftop
Or the laughter of children at play
It is the soundtrack of our world, the pulse of our existence

Yet, even in the midst of noise
We long for the silence
The stillness that calms the soul
The moment of peace amid the chaos

So let us revel in the noise
But also seek the quiet moments
For in the balance of the two
We find the harmony of life.",1

I know everything else, though, and it’s ringing in my head. Then there she is

Someone needs to find her a place to live, a hidey hole we can cram food in

"1. they were a kind of solution
Say one Spaceman, when she lands, will touch
down in a human sentence, speaking Dutch,
a dialect of Mentalese. Her torch-
songs (loosely rendered from the Arcturan): “Baby
Let’s Get Square with Pi,” or, “You’re the Apple
of My Eye,” or “Boola Theta Babel
Bye-Bye.” It might make sense. This is a heady
thought. The traditional verse, viz. “Who’s Your Daddy,”
as sung in The War of the Worlds, and signaled Mayday,mayday—a little like Beethoven’s 4th in digital
redaction—may underpin what limbic Dutch
must once upon a time have bloomed beneath the sagittal
crest of Homo—Who? What? This news just in!—the starry
sky is empty. Spacemen are out. Sorry.
2. exo-statisticians change minds, cite insufficiency of planetary bodies of right type
What, no aliens? Or, with greater dignity,life elsewhere in the universe? That window’s
shut, we learn. Astronomers, indignant
desert birds, eyes screwed to the long cinder-
scuttles of their telescopes, will voice some doubt,
one hopes! This is too lonely. Heliocentric
humility’s a habit hard to shake. Endowed
with what we’ve called “intelligence,” or “powerful
intelligence,” like-minded creatures, each an end-
point in a home-world’s evolutionary raffle,
well, just must across the vasty deeps of space
and time yearn forth to find each other with awful
big radios. That’s how the Book of Revelations
we knew used to read, rephrased so, pi be praised.
3. binary
My friend the geometer, when asked if pi
were in the sky or in the skull, replied
pi’s the pontification of a ratio.
Bisected, so, the circle: pi. To show
that in a well-formed sentence, well, that’s human, sure.
All language is. So ever since that fateful shore
of Lake Turkana where tongue forked, where first
flaking syntax split the atom into force
and mass, thing and verb, the copula
has groped to reanneal it: this opulence
is equal to the sum of those simplicities ...
So here’s the mystery: across the placid
surface of the water a salt of stars
once scattered, hissing. Caliban stammered Are
stars. Then, Look, look up at the stars!
4. prose obtrusions concerning the keats equation
Hold it there.
Would you say truth’s a property of sentences, but beauty’s not?
So that mysterious predictive gift of mathematics is precisely that of  sentences like I predict the sun will rise tomorrow?—isn’t that the leap that left the chimpanzees behind?—and adding time of sunrise just adds  increment to the precision?
So that Platonic realm where Mathematics must exist to be discovered by Ramanujan or Hardy or Arcturans tucked in anywhere in time or space is just that space where earlier equations live, like love’s a rose or tears are rain, which Hardy’s and Ramanujan’s respective ancestors discovered independently?
That if in England two men feed a horse, the horse stays thin, the axiom would hold as well for two Tibetan yaks or fat Jurassic stegosaurs (assuming less that that’s what the Arcturans use to carry mail than that, like us, they pinch their pence)—
That that’s the realm where poems and equations likewise lie unspoken,  quietly awaiting their discovery?
And so those famous instances where mathematics efflorescing on some blackboard purely for the play of it turn out to have a shocking congruence with patterns in the world is just exactly like the case where poetry is news before the news it stays?
That hadn’t the acclaimed predictive potency of mathematics best be cast as a reminder of forgotten shock—the shock our shaggy kind must once have felt, framing for the first time well-formed sentences about the world that was, and then about the world about to be, and so extended human sensibility  and thrust it forth as backward through the night of time?
Yes, if diffidently.
5. postscriptum
The aliens are back, incidentally. Astral
systems dropping planets like nuts in May. Exo-
biology leaps again into likelihood. A straw
poll proves the numbers may be multiplex.
No small relief for this slow versifier,
who, peering through this poem’s decades-long zoom-
lens has seen what changes?—sapphire
heaven bleached of all biology?—shazam!—
and then revivified, less abruptly,
with a thought. In the same blink of the clock
the pupil of a black hole was seen to matter,
some dinosaurs grew feathers, and (this one for Ripley’s)
Pluto got demoted from a planet to a rock.

You lend the strength to carry life,
A comforting and soothing balm,
Bringing peace, and healing calm.

Hope, my constant friend and guide,
In you, my trust shall always abide,
For with you by my side, I know,
The future's bright and full of glow.

So here's to you, dear hope divine,
Forever, and ever, your light will shine,
O'er land and sea, and every scope,
Hope, our greatest treasure and hope.",1
"Autumn, the season of change,
When leaves turn red, yellow, orange and strange,
The air is crisp and cool,
And nature is the artist's greatest tool.

The trees shed their leaves,
Bare branches await winter's freeze,
The days grow shorter, the nights grow longer,
The world prepares for hibernation, as if in a somber song.

The wind blows through the fields,
The harvest is in, the earth yet yields,
The scent of apples and pumpkins fill the air,
Birds take flight, nature prepares for the coming affair.

As the leaves fall, so do our memories,
Of long sunny days and joyful reveries,
The earth sleeps, but we are wide awake,
Taking in the beauty, watching the change we make.

Autumn, a time of reflection and growth,
A time for gratitude and making the most,
Of every moment before winter's chill,
And we are left to await Spring's thrill.

So embrace the season with open arms,
Let its beauty inspire you, and work its charms,
For every ending is a new beginning,
Autumn reminds us, as we keep on winning.",1
"Oh the wonder of the stars above,
A mystery so vast, a sight to love.
With twinkling lights that light up the sky,
Where ancient myths and legends lie.

Each star shines bright, a distant sun,
In a universe of shadows and fun.
The secrets they hold, we may never know,
But their beauty shines for all to show.

Their light dances in the darkest night,
Filling our hearts with a heavenly delight.
A celestial world, so far away,
Yet they guide our way, night and day.

The stars' mystery is infinite and deep,
An endless universe we cannot keep.
But they remind us of the wonder of life,
A shining beacon in a world of strife.

So let us gaze upon them with awe,
And feel their power in our very core.
For the stars' mystery will always remain,
A source of joy, wonder, and endless gain.",1
"Oh, comet in the sky so bright,
Your tail a trail of fearsome might.
You glide through space with menacing speed,
A force of nature that makes me plead.

Your trajectory is unknown to me,
As if you hold some cosmic key.
Your presence fills me with unease,
For I fear you carry ill decrees.

Will you collide with Earth one day,
And end humanity's long stay?
Or will you pass and leave us be,
A scary but distant memory?

Oh, comet in the sky so bold,
I shudder at the tales you've told.
I pray you keep your distance far,
And spare Earth from your cosmic scar.",1

"From the depths of darkness
Comes a light so bright;
A tiny soul emerges,
A pure and perfect sight.

A cry so loud and clear,
Announces a new life;
A miracle of birth,
A mother’s greatest strife.

From the first inhale of air,
To the first beat of the heart;
A journey of a lifetime,
A story of a brand new start.

The baby’s fingers and toes,
Rosy cheeks and bright eyes;
A blank slate to fill with love,
A precious little prize.

From the first steps to the first words,
To the first day of school;
A lifetime of discoveries,
And beauty to behold.

Birth is a miracle,
A wonder to behold;
A new life filled with promise,
A story yet untold.",1
"A goal I love, it drives me on
Towards a future bright and strong
It's not just fleeting or a whim
But a purpose that resides within

I dream of reaching new heights
Of challenging myself to fight
Through obstacles and endless fears
To make my vision crystal clear

With each step, I feel alive
Pushing through, I strive and strive
For this goal, I won't give up
I'll keep on moving, never stop

And though the path may twist and turn
I'll stay attentive, always learn
For every challenge, every test
Will make me stronger in the quest

So here's to chasing after dreams
For what it's worth, or so it seems
The journey's long, but I'm in love
With this goal that I hold above.",1

"Learning is an adventure, a journey we all take,
A path to enlightenment, that opens with each step we make.

We start as curious children, eager to explore,
We soak up knowledge like a sponge, and thirst for more.

Reading books and solving problems, we uncover hidden gems,
Discovering new perspectives, expanding our mental realms.

Sometimes we face obstacles, or feel like giving up,
But perseverance and determination, can fill our minds with hope.

Learning is a lifelong process, a gift we should embrace,
It enriches our lives and helps us find our rightful place.

So take each lesson as it comes, with an open heart and mind,
And let the sweet sounds of knowledge, fill your soul and unwind.

Let each day be a chance to grow, and learn something new,
A reminder that the possibilities are endless for me and you.",1
"Anxiety grips me like a vice,  
A heavy weight upon my soul.  
I try to fight, to pay the price,  
But still, it has me in its hold. 

The racing thoughts, the beating heart,  
The worry, doubt, and constant fear.  
I long to breathe, to find a start,  
But stress is always lurking near. 

It smacks me down when I am strong,  
Reminds me of my weaknesses.  
It whispers lies, my nerves prolong,  
And makes my joy and peace decrease. 

Oh, anxious feelings, how I hate  
The way you try to rule my mind.  
But I won't let you seal my fate,  
I'll fight until my peace I find. 

I'll breathe and rest, seek help when needed,  
Lean on those who love and care.  
I'll face you down, though I'm defeated,  
And find the hope that's hiding there. 

For though you plague me, anxiety,  
You will not have the final say.  
I'll rise above and find my victory,  
And live to see another day.",1

Stands firm, a sight to be seen.
With leaves so big, and stems so strong,
It shines out better than all along.

Its blossoms bloom with such great pride,
Waves around like it's going to glide.
And in the wind, they dance and sway,
Leaves a trail, a magical display.

This plant I like is calm and serene,
Brings peace to a tired mind, like a queen.
In its shade, I feel safe and secure,
Composed and confident, magnificent, pure.

And when the sun goes down, and the moon glows,
My plant shines, the star of the show.
The plant I like is a true delight,
A marvel of nature, an enchanting sight.",1

"1. Is it true that they dream?
It is true, for the spaces of night surround them with shape and purpose, like a warm hollow below the shoulders, or between the curve of thigh and belly.
The land itself can lie like this. Hence our understanding of giants.
The wind and the grass cry out to the arms of their sleep as the shore cries out, and buries its face in the bruised sea.
We all have heard barns and fences splintering against the dark with a weight that is more than wood.
The stars, too, bear witness. We can read their tails and claws as we would read the signs of our own dreams; a knot of sheets, scratches defining the edges of the body, the position of the legs upon waking.
The cage and the forest are as helpless in the night as a pair of open hands holding rain.
2. Do they dream of the past or of the future?
Think of the way a woman who wanders the roads could step into an empty farmhouse one afternoon and find a basket of eggs, some unopened letters, the pillowcases embroidered with initials that once were hers.
Think of her happiness as she sleeps in the daylilies; the air is always heaviest at the start of dusk.
Cows, for example, find each part of themselves traveling at a different rate of speed. Their bells call back to their burdened hearts the way a sparrow taunts an old hawk.
As far as the badger and the owl are concerned, the past is a silver trout circling in the ice. Each night he swims through their waking and makes his way back to the moon.
Clouds file through the dark like prisoners through an endless yard. Deer are made visible by their hunger.
I could also mention the hopes of common spiders: green thread sailing from an infinite spool, a web, a thin nest, a child dragging a white rope slowly through the sand.
3. Do they dream of this world or of another?
The prairie lies open like a vacant eye, blind to everything but the wind. From the tall grass the sky is an industrious map that bursts with rivers and cities. A black hawk waltzes against his clumsy wings, the buzzards grow bored with the dead.
A screendoor flapping idly on an August afternoon or a woman fanning herself in church; this is how the tails of snakes and cats keep time even in sleep.
There are sudden flashes of light to account for. Alligators, tormented by knots and vines, take these as a sign of grace. Eagles find solace in the far glow of towns, in the small yellow bulb a child keeps by his bed. The lightning that scars the horizon of the meadow is carried in the desperate gaze of foxes.
Have other skies fallen into this sky? All the evidence seems to say so.
Conspiracy of air, conspiracy of ice, the silver trout is thirsty for morning, the prairie dog shivers with sweat. Skeletons of gulls lie scattered on the dunes, their beaks still parted by whispering. These are the languages that fall beyond our hearing.
Imagine the way rain falls around a house at night, invisible to its sleepers. They do not dream of us.
4. How can we learn more?
This is all we will ever know.",0
"A man and a woman pretend to be white ice
Three men at the lavender door are closed in by the storm
With strong prejudice and money to buy the green pines
One weekend fisherman and blue painters watch
The vivid violet winds blow visibility from the mountain
Beyond the black valley. That means or then you know
You’re in a big cloud of it, it’s brilliant white mid-February
A week or two left on distracting black trees
Before the brownish buds obscure your view of the valley again.
Looking for company four dark men and a burnt sienna woman
Come in for three minutes, then bye-bye like a gold watch left on the
chair
Or part of the sum of what big white families think up
To store for long yellow Sundays to eat for brown ecological
company.
At some point later gorgeous red adventure stops, did you forget
To turn it down and laugh in the face of the fearful white storm
anyway
Or picture it brilliant blue for a further Sunday memory
In a coloring book, you talk as lightly as you can
Refusing a big pink kiss, you burned the Sunday sauce
Of crushed red tomatoes, you turn it down to just an orange glow.
This particular storm, considering the pause and the greenish thaw before it
Reminds me in its mildness of imitating a sea-green memory that is
actually
In the future, I imitate an imagined trumpet sound
Or the brilliant purple words of a man or woman I haven’t met yet
Or perhaps it’s a grey-haired man I already know who said some-
thing yesterday
To a mutual friend who will give me the whole story in black and
white tomorrow
Or the day after, just as the big orange plows for the local businesses
Go to work to push away the rest of the white snow that will fall
tonight.",0

"They have left behind the established cave with its well-worn floor. Scholarship impels them in hundreds, but generally one by one, to find an unknown passage or scrape out their own. Proto-Semitic linguistic theory, Hittite stratigraphic anomalies, microclimatic economics. ""What do you see?"" invisible followers ask in their ears, and they whisper ""Wonderful things"" as they quarry a grain of rock at a time, or examine a fleck of ore, or measure the acidity of a trickle of water. See! Behold! Look! Lo! they cry in season, rapt, in love, chipping away with their pocketknives, pencils, rulers, fingernails, but some have tunneled so narrowly and deep that those behind see nothing but slivers of light around an excavator's haunches. A battered piece of a tablet is all that remains of the so-called Singer of Nab. Circa 1200 BCE, he impressed, or had impressed, some words in clay. He may have composed a religious hymn, praise to the king, a poem of love, an inventory of cattle. (He may have been she, but this is unlikely.) The lines we have could be the beginning or the middle; there may have been ten more, or hundreds. The word before this gap, in fact, means ""hundreds."" Hundreds led in battle, hundreds slain? A thousand times beloved, nine hundred sheep? And the standard translation of this word, here, is either ""desire"" or ""need."" But did he write of a boundless yearning, or mercantile requirements? Was he a ""singer""? The scholars who care disagree. Look at them, crouched in a long tunnel dug by means of argument over an antique syntax, warming their hands at a chunk of brick baked maybe in the time of the Trojan War, broken some moment between then and now— peering at it with penlights, squandering eyesight. They know they may crawl out hungry, mumbling, aged and gray, clutching a secret message of small import or nothing, nothing. They seem lost. They seem happy.",0

I’m thinking the whole bundle of it rolls out like a white tablecloth. We wanted to be good company for one another. Little did we know that first picnic how this would go. Your hair was thick, mine long and easy; we climbed a bluff to look over a storybook plain. We chose our spot as high as we could, to see the river and the checkerboard fields.

"1 It opens as a long lamplit evening with Rembrandt, stretched out with the glossy book of his Works on Paper. Brown-petal etchings and drawings: nut-brown, browner, irreclaimable rills of iron-gall ink sucked and feathered into the paper's wan cusps and culverts. The ink...it's as if there's no pulling away from the wet, flowing line to the tiny hedge-village perched on the edge of the cliff and the paper. Here the ink's overwatered and we barely, down in the forested loam, disengage the gentle saint, his rounded hat molding his crown like thatch on low rooftrees...St. Jerome.                                      2 Hunched, sunk in a deep-toned wash, he cares only for the huge, softleaved book propped on his knees. At nightfall Jerome swallowed up by his Bible misses the wistful look of his lion withdrawn to the forested ridge, the drawing's diagonal. And from there, one can say that landscape exists: prowls and spinnies where a lion might wind a lioness, or his prey... He looks out on tree-clouded peaks, tiny hamlets, two lambs in a wattle-fold. What the lion sees, we see. For Jerome, though, the lion is Judah, his seal and seed— Jesse's stem drops thickset leaves for him to read.                                      3 Saskia, of course, thrones in painting. Still, tiny sketches tumble from odd cabinets: the dear in a lopsided turban or twilled garden hat, sketched ""on my wedding-day""— Saskia. A cluster of lines, a rippled race of curls and cloudsets. And, for a rarity, in Rembrandt, flowers. The simple, surprised, smiling face of Saskia as Flora...After her fourth lying-in (she was dying), he took to long walks on the city's outskirts; his sketchbook came home with mere touches of charcoal, a reed, a waterfowl, estuarial shallows unfolding to the rim.                                      4 Now life is meaner, chaotic. Rushes of arousal, lawsuits, debts...this print of a kitchen drab, eyes wandering, mouth a vacant, uptilted half-lune, her work-swollen hands on Saskia's velvet shawl, The thighs parted, abdomen pear-pendulant, the pulled-off stocking-stays grooved in the flab to her copse of cross-hatchings—No one wants to see this. But his hand made this stock, of himself the substance and seed. Fine- spun cosmos, brown tangle, soft sign: the old man spares us nothing. The book, the look, the lieu, the end of the Line.",0

As the stars in her eyes shine bright
She dances with the moon and sky
Underneath the glowing night

Her dress flows like a gentle breeze
As she moves with perfect ease
Her heart beats to the rhythm of the stars
And her mind wanders to far-off Mars

And thorny plants that pierce through skin

And the smell of rot and decay is hard to beat
Invisible to the human eye, bugs and disease
Lurk around, waiting to interrupt with ease

Nature keeps a balance in all it does
The jungle is one case where it unfolds

Fearful of what could happen if I don't obey

A place where wild things roam and lurk
Let only the brave tread the unknown

A journey into the unknown, a leap of faith, after all

And I, a part of this vastness, shall continue to thrive
In the black hole's shadow, my curiosity alive.",1

Somewhere a hammer made thunderclaps,
forging the night-sky.
Then the children,
seeing us, dashed from the Moorish houses,
vigorously shouting, vying for position,
while the bravest,
in worn underpants and plastic sandals,
climbed a high crater-like wall

repelled by the wet black princes

money ran through the fingers
of our house, with nothing much
to record its loss but unhappiness:
one of us ironing servilely,
one of us sobbing in a bedroom,
one of us sleeping on a rifle,
one of us seizing another by the hair,
demanding the animal-like submission
we thought was love.
Sunday evening.
Mother is wearing a big cotton shift
and tweezing her eyebrows.
Her head is a thicket of hairpins.
In the round hand-mirror
that parodies her face,
the world looks greater than it is.
I am next to bathe in the water
of the poor earth, reused by each of us
in order of birth. Gray with sodium and grit,
it covers me like a black robe,
and yet I feel exalted.
Soon the violent rain,
like wet Sahara sand, would fall,
scrubbing the hot labyrinthine
corridors of shuttered houses and aimless dogs,
where the sparse life is
purgative and inexhaustible,
where little pilfering hands
moved freely in and out
of my trouser pockets,
though there were no diamonds
except those the eyes mined.",0
"Flowing, cutting through the land
The river runs free, untamed and grand
From its source it courses down
Through meadows and hills, without a frown

In its water, life is born
Fish, plants, and creatures adorn
The river's bed, a world unknown,
Full of secrets, on its own

In springtime, it roars and swells
Torrential force, mighty spell
Summer breeze, a whisper's tone 
And autumn's leaves, a river shown

The river, tireless journeyer 
From start to end, a conqueror 
It shapes the land, sings its tune,
Through ages, cycles and full moons

Flowing, pure and full of grace 
The river remains, a sacred place 
An ever-changing, faithful friend
The river flows, till the very end.",1
"Why are the things that have no death
The ones with neither sight nor breath!
Eternity is thrust upon
A bit of earth, a senseless stone.
A grain of dust, a casual clod
Receives the greatest gift of God.
A pebble in the roadway lies—
It never dies.
The grass our fathers cut away
Is growing on their graves today;
The tiniest brooks that scarcely flow
Eternally will come and go.
There is no kind of death to kill
The sands that lie so meek and still. . . .
But Man is great and strong and wise—
And so he dies.",0
"Go, lovely rose!
Tell her that wastes her time and me,
That now she knows,
When I resemble her to thee,
How sweet and fair she seems to be.
Tell her that’s young,
And shuns to have her graces spied,
That hadst thou sprung
In deserts, where no men abide,
Thou must have uncommended died.
Small is the worth
Of beauty from the light retired;
Bid her come forth,
Suffer herself to be desired,
And not blush so to be admired.
Then die! that she
The common fate of all things rare
May read in thee;
How small a part of time they share
That are so wondrous sweet and fair!",0
"This saying good-by on the edge of the dark
And the cold to an orchard so young in the bark
Reminds me of all that can happen to harm
An orchard away at the end of the farm
All winter, cut off by a hill from the house.
I don't want it girdled by rabbit and mouse,
I don't want it dreamily nibbled for browse
By deer, and I don't want it budded by grouse.
(If certain it wouldn't be idle to call
I'd summon grouse, rabbit, and deer to the wall
And warn them away with a stick for a gun.)
I don't want it stirred by the heat of the sun.
(We made it secure against being, I hope,
By setting it out on a northerly slope.)
No orchard's the worse for the wintriest storm;
But one thing about it, it mustn't get warm.
""How often already you've had to be told,
Keep cold, young orchard. Good-by and keep cold.
Dread fifty above more than fifty below.""
I have to be gone for a season or so.
My business awhile is with different trees,
Less carefully nourished, less fruitful than these,
And such as is done to their wood with an ax—
Maples and birches and tamaracks.
I wish I could promise to lie in the night
And think of an orchard's arboreal plight
When slowly (and nobody comes with a light)
Its heart sinks lower under the sod.
But something has to be left to God.",0

"The woman in the building across from me
hauls onto the fire escape a yucca plant
and squeezes it between a crate
of herbs and a sapling fern tree.
She looks a lot like me from twenty feet away.
A forelock lies sweaty against her cheek
as if she’s forgotten to fix herself.
I put my thumbs and forefingers
to my eye and frame her. I am reminded
of those Chinese boxes made of red paper,
inside one is another holding another,
until at the center sits the tiniest mockery
and celebration of the cell itself.
She looks haggard but happy here, five flights
up, bending over a fat leaf as if admiring herself
in the waxy surface. Then she opens up
the jewel-case of her voice,
and I remember how once my sister asked
my mother which one of us sang better.
My mother paused from sewing as if adding
seventeen to seventy-five and said we sounded
the same. Good or bad, who knows.

open mouth of the other.",0
"In times of struggle, we must stand strong
Amidst the turmoil, we must carry on
With hearts full of hope and healing
We'll rise above the pain, unyielding

Like a symphony, we'll play our part
With each note, we'll heal a broken heart
Our music will lift us up and inspire
To face each day with courage and fire

We'll sing of love and compassion
And the strength found in connection
With our voices raised in harmony
We'll find our way to unity

For in this symphony of hope and healing
We'll find the light amid the darkest feeling
And with each melody we create
We'll write a new story, full of grace.",1
"Je vois les effroyables espaces de l’Univers qui m’enferment, et je me trouve attaché à un coin de cette vaste étendue, sans savoir pourquoi je suis plutôt en ce lieu qu’en un autre, ni pourquoi ce peu de temps qui m’est donné à vivre m’est assigné à ce point plutôt qu'à un autre de toute l’éternité qui m’a précédé, et de toute qui me suit.
—Pascal, Pensées sur la religion
The approach of a man’s life out of the past is history, and the approach of time out of the future is mystery. Their meeting is the present, and it is consciousness, the only time life is alive. The endless wonder of this meeting is what causes the mind, in its inward liberty of a frozen morning, to turn back and question and remember. The world is full of places. Why is it that I am here?
—Wendell Berry, The Long-Legged House
Spared by a car or airplane crash or
cured of malignancy, people look
around with new eyes at a newly
praiseworthy world, blinking eyes like these.
For I’ve been brought back again from the
fine silt, the mud where our atoms lie
down for long naps. And I’ve also been
pardoned miraculously for years
by the lava of chance which runs down
the world’s gullies, silting us back.
Here I am, brought back, set up, not yet
happened away.
But it’s not this random
life only, throwing its sensual
astonishments upside down on
the bloody membranes behind my eyeballs,
not just me being here again, old
needer, looking for someone to need,
but you, up from the clay yourself,
as luck would have it, and inching
over the same little segment of earth-
ball, in the same little eon, to
meet in a room, alive in our skins,
and the whole galaxy gaping there
and the centuries whining like gnats—
you, to teach me to see it, to see
it with you, and to offer somebody
uncomprehending, impudent thanks.",0
"Near the dry river’s water-mark we found
Your brother Minnegan,
Flopped like a fish against the muddy ground.
Beany, the kid whose yellow hair turns green,
Told me to find you, even in the rain,
And tell you he was drowned.
I hid behind the chassis on the bank,
The wreck of someone’s Ford:
I was afraid to come and wake you drunk:
You told me once the waking up was hard,
The daylight beating at you like a board.
Blood in my stomach sank.
Beside, you told him never to go out
Along the river-side
Drinking and singing, clattering about.
You might have thrown a rock at me and cried
I was to blame, I let him fall in the road
And pitch down on his side.
Well, I’ll get hell enough when I get home
For coming up this far,
Leaving the note, and running as I came.
I’ll go and tell my father where you are.
You’d better go find Minnegan before
Policemen hear and come.
Beany went home, and I got sick and ran,
You old son of a bitch.
You better hurry down to Minnegan;
He’s drunk or dying now, I don’t know which,
Rolled in the roots and garbage like a fish,
The poor old man.",0

"The problem
of time.          Of there not being
enough of it.
My girl came to the study
and said Help me;
I told her I had a time problem
which meant:
I would die for you but I don’t have ten minutes.
Numbers hung in the math book
like motel coathangers. The Lean
Cuisine was burning
like an ancient city: black at the edges,
bubbly earth tones in the center.
The latest thing they’re saying is lack
of time might be
a “woman’s problem.” She sat there
with her math book sobbing—
(turned out to be prime factoring: whole numbers
dangle in little nooses)
Hawking says if you back up far enough
it’s not even
an issue, time falls away into
'the curve' which is finite,
boundaryless. Appointment book,
soprano telephone—
(beep End beep went the microwave)
The hands fell off my watch in the night.
I spoke to the spirit
who took them, told her: Time is the funniest thing
they invented. Had wakened from a big
dream of love in a boat
No time to get the watch fixed so the blank face
lived for months in my dresser,
no arrows
for hands, just quartz intentions, just the pinocchio
nose         (before the lie)
left in the center;            the watch
didn’t have twenty minutes; neither did I.
My girl was doing
her gym clothes by herself;         (red leaked
toward black, then into the white
insignia)                  I was grading papers,
heard her call from the laundry room:
Mama?
Hawking says there are two
types of it,
real and imaginary (imaginary time must be
like decaf), says it’s meaningless
to decide which is which
but I say: there was tomorrow-
and-a-half
when I started thinking about it; now
there’s less than a day. More
done. That’s
the thing that keeps being said. I thought
I could get more done as in:
fish stew from a book. As in: Versateller
archon, then push-push-push
the tired-tired around the track like a planet.
Legs, remember him?
Our love—when we stagger—lies down inside us. . .
Hawking says
there are little folds in time
(actually he calls them wormholes)
but I say:
there’s a universe beyond
where they’re hammering the brass cut-outs .. .
Push us out in the boat and leave time here—
(because: where in the plan was it written,
You’ll be too busy to close parentheses,
the snapdragon’s bunchy mouth needs water,
even the caterpillar will hurry past you?
Pulled the travel alarm
to my face: the black
behind the phosphorous argument kept the dark
from being ruined. Opened
the art book
—saw the languorous wrists of the lady
in Tissot’s “Summer Evening.” Relaxed. Turning
gently. The glove
(just slightly—but still:)
“aghast”;
opened Hawking, he says, time gets smoothed
into a fourth dimension
but I say
space thought it up, as in: Let’s make
a baby space, and then
it missed. Were seconds born early, and why
didn’t things unhappen also, such as
the tree became Daphne. . .
At the beginning of harvest, we felt
the seven directions.
Time did not visit us. We slept
till noon.
With one voice I called him, with one voice
I let him sleep, remembering
summer years ago,
I had come to visit him in the house of last straws
and when he returned
above the garden of pears, he said
our weeping caused the dew. . .
I have borrowed the little boat
and I say to him Come into the little boat,
you were happy there;
the evening reverses itself, we’ll push out
onto the pond,
or onto the reflection of the pond,
whichever one is eternal",0
"Amidst the stars and galaxies,
A symphony can be heard,
A different kind of music
That transcends every word.

The universe is a canvas,
Where cosmic melodies align,
Each planet, each comet,
In perfect harmony combined.

The rhythms of the galaxies,
Are played in cosmic tune,
The planets dance a ballet,
To the beat of the moon.

The pulsing of the stars,
Is a song that never ends,
A celestial orchestra,
That only the universe comprehends.

The Harmonies of the Universe,
Are sublime beyond compare,
The music of the cosmos,

A never-ending rhythm of life,
Each crest and trough, a dance and more,
A symphony of ephemeral strife.

The roar of thunder, the crash of sound,
As each wave breaks upon the sand,
A captivating sight to be found,
A beauty to soothe the heart and hand.

The ocean's waves, brought by the wind,
A force of nature, wild and free,
A sight that can awaken a dream,
A song to heal both you and me.

The waves come and go, day after day,
A constant reminder, truth to say,
That life's a journey, a force to obey,
And in the end, we all shall pass away.

A never-ending rhythm of life,
A tale of struggle and so much more,
A reminder to enjoy the ride.",1

Bringing treasures and secrets from distant shores 
The salt and the spray, they fill up your soul 
As you lose yourself in the vastness, made whole 

The vibrant hues, from sapphire to teal 
A kaleidoscope of colors, a mesmerizing feel 
The sunsets and sunrises, stunning to see 
The sea, it glistens, its magnificence, a key 

The creatures that call it home, a sight to behold 
Dolphins, whales, and fish, all graceful and bold 
The corals and the seaweed, their own symphony 
Underwater gardens, a world of harmony

A true natural wonder, never to be controlled 
It’s vast, it’s mighty, yet serene in its embrace 
The sea, a true beauty, that time can never erase.",1
"1.
This one happens in morning
as a nearby crow wakes me,
calling God, God, look at this :
I am on the steps of a church,
wrapped in Monday's Korea Times
telling of the drought in Pusan.
You can live by the water
and still die of thirst, and I,
there on the cold brick steps,
am dying. But dying
means the presence of breath.
This one happens on Hangul Day,
Independence Day in Seoul,
where girls in purple satin
hanboks parade through
downtown streets. In this dream
I make eye contact with
every single one of them.
Another boy, a few years
older than I, rides
a tricycle in the parade,
trailing the girls.
He sees me. He winks,
as if he knows how
everything will end.
2.
This one happens in the evening
just as daylight surrenders to the moon,
and the flute of dusk arrives.
It is cool.
I am wrapped in a sky blue blanket,
so whoever finds me thinks kindly
of whoever left me.
The one who finds me is a nun.
She opens the door, looking
beyond me
into the tired night,
then looks down.
She gasps softly.
She says, ahneyong, you sweet
beautiful child. She bends
down like an angel
and takes me
into her arms.
3.
This one happens in the cruelest moment
of the day, as heat curls flowers
into dirt. A man, drunk
with despair, screams at the sun.
His sorrow is a collage of
moths and ants, crawling
from his face to his chest.
I watch from the steps.
It is the year of the dog
and I am a part of it :
unable to speak
but an expert at listening :
to the old man from Laos who sits
on the steps two buildings down :
he is telling another man
how Hmong children become human
on the third day of life,
after the soul calling ceremony
and the burning of animal flesh.
He smokes from a pipe
and closes his eyes as he inhales.
I can hear all of this.
I can hear a woman rustling inside the church.
She is a dancer, so she speaks with her hands.
I hear her rise, sweetly
from her knees to her feet.
This means she believes
in dreams. I hear her
slide her hand, sweetly
along her hair. This means
she believes in the sun.
I hear her move towards me
and place her open palm on the door.
This means she welcomes me.
This means she believes
in the miracle of possibility.",0
"Amidst the thorns and blooms, 
A place of solitude and peace, 
Heart's secret garden, 
Where whispers never cease. 

A haven of untold stories, 
Where emotions take root, 
Each petal, every leaf, 
Holds memories that mute. 

Silent whispers of love, 
Deep passions that never fade, 
Promises made with a smile, 
Broken dreams that failed. 

Yet amidst the heartache, 
Hope thrives in the garden's heart, 
Beneath the tears and sorrow, 
Love still plays a part. 

And as the days go passing by, 
And seasons come and go, 
Whispers from the heart's secret garden, 
Remind us all to grow.",1

Drags wrinkled on a dusty floor,
A party dress,
Sagging from those shoulders

Make the cloak a shroud.
He whinnys through the nose,
paws the trailing hem

Soft pitter-patter, a soothing proof,

And leaves our worries far behind.

A calming sound that makes us whole,
As flickering flames dance and play,
We forget the stress of the day.

The lapping waves against the shore,
A tranquil sound that we adore,
A rhythmic pulse that eases time,
And makes our troubles seem benign.

In quiet stillness, we can hear,
The music of the world so clear,
A symphony that sings of peace,
And bids our busy minds release.

So let us cherish these calming sounds,
That ease our hearts and heal our wounds,

We find a place where we're at home.",1

hands in pockets,

The sunrises and sunsets we witness
The landscapes that leave us breathless
The cultures we learn and explore

To embrace the world with an open heart
And leave for a while from where we had to depart

The world is out there waiting
A world full of love and amazing
A world full of wonder and awe
Just waiting for us to explore and be in awe

A journey to lighten up your load

A journey that makes our hearts sing.",1
"‘He thought it had only been put there
to finish off th’ alphabet, like, though
ampus-and (&) would ha’ done as well.’
(George Eliot: Adam Bede)
And had in fact, for generations—
the plump, open armed ‘&’ waving goodbye
from the end of the old-world alphabet
like an innkeeper framed in doorway candlelight,
farewells swelled with hopes of come again.
Then the old world burned down
because we sensed, beyond the candle’s glow,
the road led to a dead end. No
traveler returned, even the unverified
odd reports of happy returns petered out.
So we renovated the alphabet, signing it
off with a streamlined ‘z’ as sharp
and final as lightning: no sense
in posting notice of further connections
that didn’t exist, or passing off maps as places.
Trouble was, nobody felt at home
in the revamped compound. Bookings fell off,
postcards of views of blank walls piled unsold
in the unvisited gift shop, the same
paperbacks stalled on the revolving racks.
It was a paradise of sorts, a golden age
of nullity, no relatives
breaking the costly silence. No wonder Eliot’s
befuddled Jacob Storey felt his page
of Z’s was somehow ‘not right,’ that
‘it was a letter you never wanted hardly.’
He knew, as one newly released from the unlit
cell of his long-unlettered ignorance,
what you did want hardly: you wanted,
needed—as hardly as Hetty Sorrel,
abandoned at the dock—someone to stand by.
You were the murderess of your baby,
silenced with a ‘z.’ You needed a hand,
the open-armed return of all your relations.
You wanted, harder than death, ampersand",0

Between extremes of pleasure and pain,

We need a balance of work and rest,

Emotional balance is essential too, 
To keep our minds in check, 
And a balance between give and take, 
Ensures our relationships stay in check. 

Life is a balancing act, 
And we need to be mindful and present, 
To keep ourselves centred and focused,

My palms grow moist, my heart it haunts,
The thought of trying to conquer it,
Makes my mind spin and my stomach split.

I fear the art of public speaking,
My words get lost and my knees start weakening,
The thought of being in front of crowds,
Makes me wish I could hide in the clouds.

But I know that with practice and time,
I can learn to speak with confidence divine,
My voice can impact, inspire and move,
If only I confront this fear and prove.

So I'll take small steps, prepare and plan,
And slowly but surely, rise up to stand,
In front of a crowd, owning my skill,
And showing them my talent and will.

To grow and learn with accountability,
And by facing it square, with courage and grace,
I can conquer it and find my rightful place.",1
"Walking past the open window, she is surprised by the song of the white-throated sparrow and stops to listen. She has been thinking of the dead ones she loves--her father who lived over a century, and her oldest son, suddenly gone at forty-seven--and she can't help thinking she has called them back, that they are calling her in the voices of these birds passing through Ohio on their spring migration. . . because, after years of summers in upstate New York, the white-throat has become something like the family bird. Her father used to stop whatever he was doing and point out its clear, whistling song. She hears it again: ""Poor Sam Peabody Peabody Peabody."" She tries not to think, ""Poor Andy,"" but she has already thought it, and now she is weeping. But then she hears another, so clear, it's as if the bird were in the room with her, or in her head, telling her that everything will be all right. She cannot see them from her second-story window-- they are hidden in the new leaves of the old maple, or behind the white blossoms of the dogwood-- but she stands and listens, knowing they will stay for only a few days before moving on.",0
"“A true Arab knows how to catch a fly in his hands,”
my father would say. And he’d prove it,
cupping the buzzer instantly
while the host with the swatter stared.
In the spring our palms peeled like snakes.
True Arabs believed watermelon could heal fifty ways.
I changed these to fit the occasion.
Years before, a girl knocked,
wanted to see the Arab.
I said we didn’t have one.
After that, my father told me who he was,
“Shihab”—“shooting star”—
a good name, borrowed from the sky.
Once I said, “When we die, we give it back?”
He said that’s what a true Arab would say.
Today the headlines clot in my blood.

Homeless fig, this tragedy with a terrible root
is too big for us. What flag can we wave?
I wave the flag of stone and seed,
table mat stitched in blue.
I call my father, we talk around the news.
It is too much for him,
neither of his two languages can reach it.

to plead with the air:
Who calls anyone civilized?

In a language only they can say.

Amidst the dance of spring blossoms,
My heart swells with delight,
For in this magic moment,
The world feels just right.

So let us revel in this joy,
And savor the beauty they bring,
For in the dance of spring blossoms,
We hear the sweet song of spring.",1
"A mineral of beauty, rare and divine,
A gem that shimmers like sun on the sea,
With hues of blue and green that intertwine,
And sparkle with joyous energy.

In the deep caves, it glows with a glow,
With a radiance so piercing and bright,
It dazzles and dances with a warming flow,
A mineral that fills the heart with delight.

It's a gem that nature has carved with precision,
A treasure that's formed from the earth's inner core,
A mineral that symbolizes our connection,
To the universe that we explore and adore.

Oh, how beautiful, untouched and sublime,
This mineral is a wonder to behold,
A symbol of nature that stands the test of time,
A gem that's precious, yet priceless, and bold.

So let us treasure this mineral forever,
And honor the beauty that nature impart,
For it's a precious gift that we should never,
Take for granted, but cherish with all our heart.",1
"The first space shuttle launch got delayed until
Sunday, so we had to watch the shuttle’s return
to Earth in class instead—PS113’s paunchy black
& white rolled in, the antennae on top adjusted
sideways & down for better reception. That same
day, Garrett stole my new pencil box. That same
day, Cynthia peed her jeans instead of going
to the bathroom & letting Garrett steal her pencil
box. Both of us too upset to answer questions about
space flight, so we got sent to the back of the class.
I smelled like the kind of shame that starts a fight
on a Tuesday afternoon. Cynthia smelled like pee
& everyday Jordache. The shuttle made its slick way
back to Earth, peeling clouds from the monochromatic
sky & we all—even the astronomically marginal—
were winners. American, because a few days before,
a failed songwriter put a bullet in the president
in the name of Jodie Foster. The shuttle looked
like a bullet, only with wings & a cockpit, & when
it finally landed, the class broke into applause
& the teacher snatched a thinning American flag
from the corner, waved it back & forth in honor
of our wounded president & those astronauts.",0
"Butterflies flutter in the breeze
Their wings an elegant display 
A dance of grace and beauty
In the sunshine's warm array

They twirl and spin in unison
A ballet in the air 
Their movements choreographed 
With such precision and care 

Their colors, oh so vibrant 
A rainbow on the wing 
Each one unique in pattern 
And yet they all do sing 

A symphony of fluttering 
A celebration in the air 
The dance of these butterflies 
Is a wonder to behold and bear 

So pause and watch in wonder 
As they whirl and twirl and prance 
The dance of these butterflies 
Is a sight that will entrance",1
"Oh mighty tree, how you stand tall,
Branches reaching out, never to fall.
A sight to behold, a wonder to see,
Your leaves swaying gently, setting us free.

From afar, your size may seem daunting,
But up close, it's truly awe-inspiring.
Your trunk standing strong, a source of pride,
The perfect blend of grace and grit to abide.

From times of bloom to shedding leaves,
You've braved every storm and never grieved.
Rooted deep into the ground you stand,
A symbol of resilience, never to disband.

Oh, how I admire your beauty, tree,
A true wonder, a treasure to see.
Your presence brings peace, a calming force,
A gift of nature, an eternal source.

May you continue to grow and inspire,
A beacon of hope, a love to aspire.
Forever embodying what it means to be alive,
The epitome of grace, you make my heart thrive.",1
"St. Joseph’s Hospital, Tacoma WA, 1969-74.
A headache makes your mouth plunge, then it pulls away. The smell of diesel or the smell of rain. Now you are a thick suburb. Under the pressure of a credit card. Your body is a box of mirrors, a mercury mine. You have blossomed and spread, white mystery of spring. All your blood and treasure is spent. O rose, you are sick. The morning rain does not nourish you. Your mouth is caught in a rigid O. Where only deficit is at home. You stand beneath a white hospital, almost drunk. You cannot say why your sense is drenched: exhaustion or debt. What’s the difference again? A braid of eyes. Curtains the color of a dove’s wing. Ceramic lips framed against seismic shatter. “Soft zone.” Meanwhile your uncle is dying in San Francisco and you do not know it. You are standing in front of another hospital whose patients are strangers. You unwind a rope of carbon so that you can post pictures of it on the internet. How much damage does your life do and how can you refuse? O rose, you are sick. Only injury sustains you.",0
"I played a game, so full of fun,
With friends who laughed beneath the sun.
We raced and chased and ran so fast,
To win the prize we all amassed.

The game was simple, yet so clever,
We'd play for hours, it felt like never.
We'd roll the dice and move our piece,
Each twist and turn, we'd try to piece.

But then came moments, oh so sly,
When chance would strike, and luck would fly.
Our hearts would pound, our hands would shake,
As we wondered what move to make.

And when at last the game was done,
And all the battles fought and won,
We'd count the points, and who had won,
And smile with joy, at all the fun.

This game we played, it brought such cheer,
A treasured memory, year after year.
For in that moment, we were free,
To be ourselves, and just be happy.",1
"It was cousin Alvin who stole the liquor,
slipped down Aunt Mabie's steps on the ice,
fresh from jail for some small crime.
Alvin liked to make us laugh while he took
the liquor or other things we did not see,
in Aunt Mabie's with her floors polished,
wood she polished on her hands and knees
until they were truth itself and slippery
enough to trick you, Aunt Mabie who loved
her Calvert Extra and loved the bright inside
of family, the way we come connected in webs,
born in clusters of promises, dotted
with spots that mark our place in the karma
of good times, good times in the long ribbon
of being colored I learned when colored
had just given way to Negro and Negro was
leaving us because blackness chased it out
of the house, made it slip on the ice, fall
down and spill N-e-g-r-o all over the sidewalk
until we were proud in a new avenue of pride,
as thick as the scrapple on Saturday morning
with King syrup, in the good times, between
the strikes and layoffs at the mills when work
was too slack, and Pop sat around pretending
not to worry, not to let the stream of sweat
he wiped from his head be anything except
the natural way of things, keeping his habits,
the paper in his chair by the window, the radio
with the Orioles, with Earl Weaver the screamer
and Frank Robinson the gentle black man,
keeping his habits, Mama keeping hers,
the WSID gospel in the mornings, dusting
the encyclopedias she got from the A&P,
collecting the secrets of neighbors, holding
marriages together, putting golden silence
on children who took the wrong turns, broke
the laws of getting up and getting down
on your knees. These brittle things we call
memories rise up, like the aroma of scrapple,
beauty and ugliness, life's mix
where the hard and painful things from folk
who know no boundaries live beside
the bright eyes that look into each other,
searching their pupils for paths to prayer.",0
"Of thee, kind boy, I ask no red and white,     To make up my delight;     No odd becoming graces, Black eyes, or little know-not-whats in faces; Make me but mad enough, give me good store Of love for her I count;     I ask no more, ’Tis love in love that makes the sport. There’s no such thing as that we beauty call,     It is mere cozenage all;     For though some, long ago, Liked certain colors mingled so and so, That doth not tie me now from choosing new; If I a fancy take     To black and blue, That fancy doth it beauty make. ’Tis not the meat, but ’tis the appetite     Makes eating a delight;     And if I like one dish More than another, that a pheasant is; What in our watches, that in us is found: So to the height and nick     We up be wound, No matter by what hand or trick.",0
"A desert, vast and bare,
A place of heat and sand,
Yet within its emptiness,
A beautiful world expands.

The colors of the desert,
Are a symphony of hues,
From the deep oranges and browns,
To the subtle greens and blues.

The sand dunes shift and change,
As the winds carve their way,
Creating patterns beautiful,
To witness every day.

Camels traverse the desert,
A caravan in the sun,
A reminder of the beauty,
That exists for everyone.

The desert may seem barren,
A place of stark despair,
But look beyond its surface,
And you'll find beauty rare.

For in this vast expanse,
There's a world you've yet to see,
A desert full of wonder,
A place of mystery.",1
"when I’m
braced for a mugging is stranger than the
Eritrean boy asking the question
outside Clifton Hill station. The skinnier
for baggies he’s hop & a skip
across three lanes following my hand.
No way to countermand him.
No way he’d stay for the whole
story. The ghosts of spray-can gangs
who tagged the length & breadth of the subway
are benign I’d tell him. There’ll be
the odd gutter-crawler in front of the House
of Love. Keep walking. The garage’ll be closed
but in summertime a gaggle
of mechanics will punt a football
in the road there. One missing his mark
is bound to call an Eritrean
to kick it back. Ignore them.

"The moon shines bright up in the sky  
A beacon of light for us all to spy  
It casts its glow on everything below  
And makes the night come alive, you know  

The stars twinkle and dance in its light  
A mesmerizing display that's quite a sight  
The trees sway gently in the breeze  
And the moon's light reflects off the leaves  

It's a peaceful and tranquil scene  
The world is bathed in a silver sheen  
The moon shines on, steadfast and true  
Illuminating everything in view  

From the smallest blade of grass to the tallest tree  
The moon's light touches everything it sees  
And in its glow, we find a sense of peace  
As the moon's light brings the darkness to release  

So let us bask in the moon's light tonight  
And let it fill us with a sense of delight  
For it's a constant reminder of something bright  
In the darkness of our everyday sight.",1
"Krakatau split with a blinding noise and raised from gutted, steaming rock a pulverized black sky, over water walls that swiftly fell on Java and Sumatra. Fifteen days before, in its cage in Amsterdam, the last known member of Equus quagga, the southernmost subspecies of zebra, died. Most of the wild ones, not wild enough, grazing near the Cape of Good Hope, had been shot and skinned and roasted by white hunters. When a spider walked on cooling Krakatau's skin, no quagga walked anywhere. While seeds pitched by long winds onto newborn fields burst open and rooted, perhaps some thistle flourished on the quagga's discarded innards. The fractured island greened and hummed again; handsome zebras tossed their heads in zoos, on hired safari plains. Who needs to hear a quagga's voice? Or see the warm hide twitch away a fly, see the neck turn, curving its cream and chestnut stripes that run down to plain dark haunches and plain white legs? A kind of horse. Less picturesque than a dodo. Still, we mourn what we mourn. Even if, when it sank to its irreplaceable knees, when its unique throat closed behind a sigh, no dust rose to redden a whole year's sunsets, no one unwittingly busy two thousand miles away jumped at the sound, no ashes rained on ships in the merciless sea.",0
"Soft whispers of the summer breeze,
Bring symphonies of longing ease.
The sun shines bright upon our love,
A symphony composed above.

The rhythm of our hearts entwine,
As our souls become refined.
The melodies of our sweet embrace,
Dance in time and leave no trace.

The scent of blooming flowers in the air,
Creates a symphony beyond compare.
Every moment spent with you,
Is a song that's always new.

Melodies of a summer's love,
Are the notes that we dream of.
A serenade that never ends,
A love that our heart defends.",1
"The question echoes in my mind,
A riddle I cannot unwind.
It haunts my thoughts both day and night,
As I search for answers without sight.

What lies beyond the great unknown?
A mystery aglow, yet never shown.
Is there a purpose to our lives,
Or do we simply take the ride?

I've pondered long and searched in vain,
For answers that will ease the pain.
But still the question lingers on,
As I wander through life's unknowns.

Perhaps the answer lies within,
A truth we've yet to comprehend.
Or maybe it's a question meant to be,
Forever asked, eternally.

So I'll keep asking, keep exploring,
Knowing I'll never know for sure.
But through the search, I'll find my way,
And maybe find some peace one day.",1

"Flowers, oh flowers, how beautifully you grow
Amidst the grass and weeds, you surely glow
In every color you bloom, like a rainbow
From the deep red roses to the violets below.

Your petals, delicate and velvety soft
Reaching for the sun, reaching up aloft
Your scent so sweet, nature’s precious gift
Attracting bees and butterflies in a lift.

In the gentle breeze, you sway and dance
A natural rhythm, a divine romance
How you touch my soul, my heart, my mind
Bringing peace, hope and joy combined.

In gardens, meadows, and forest clearings
Your beauty never fades, never tires of appearing
Season after season, you grace this land
Forever dear, forever grand.

Flowers, oh flowers, how lovely you are
For you remind us of life’s fragility, life’s star
In your simplicity, your grace, your power
We find meaning, love and honor.",1

Like a little world of bliss.
Beauty guards thy looks: the rose
In them pure and eternal is.

A place I never go,
Where murky waters flow,
A place I do not know.

And the currents swift and deep,
The waters rush along,
And the secrets that they keep.

I feel the pull of its tide,
A force I cannot fight,
A place where danger lies,
And shadows haunt the night.

The river is a mystery,
A place of hidden fears,
Where the unknown canot be seen,
And the echoes of the years.

Though other streams may call,
And paths may tempt me too,
I'll stay away from this one,
And look for something new.

For the river holds a power,
A force that I can't ignore,
And though it calls to me,
It's a place I must explore.",1

I may not lift a hand to clear
My eyes of salty drops that sear.

Thy agony of Bloody Sweat?)

Than all the hosts of land and sea.

The season of secrets done.
Or as one on country linen
Wakes with a start one morning—
Then on comfort snugger than pillows
Floats: July at the lake.
Or has married a golden girl
And can hardly believe, but turning
Sees blossom for him that very face
Worshipping cameras take.
Toy trains whirr perky on
Till springs contort beneath;
The middle-age rower slumps
Like a sack—indignant seizure!
Late editions wailScreen Star in Mystery Death—
Yet in those same days
He woke with a sense of treasure.
Knowing: my love is safe
Though the Rockies plunge like water,
Though surf like a wildfire rage
And omens roam the sky;
Though limbs of the swimmer laze
Pale where the seaweed caught her,
Nothing can touch my love
As dangerous time goes by.",0

"Oh how I miss those challenging days,
The ones that pushed me in so many ways.
The adrenaline rush and the fear of failure,
Made me feel alive, made me feel stronger.

The harder the challenge, the greater the reward,
It felt like climbing a steep mountain or being aboard.
The feeling of success was worth every tear,
The sense of accomplishment, it felt so near.

Those daily battles and constant struggles,
Gave me the courage to face my future troubles.
The lessons learned and the lessons taught,
Were all worth the fight, all worth the cost.

make sanitized excuses for the war.
There are innumerable kinds of bread
brought up from bakeries, baked in the kitchen:
the date, the latitude, tell which one was
dropped by a child beneath the bloodied branches.
The uncontrolled and multifurcate branches
of possibility infiltrate houses’
walls, windowframes, ceilings. Where there was
a tower, a town: ash and burnt wires, a graph
on a distant computer screen. Elsewhere, a kitchen
table’s setting gapes, where children bred
to branch into new lives were culled for war.
Who wore this starched smocked cotton dress? Who wore
this jersey blazoned for the local branch
of the district soccer team? Who left this black bread
and this flat gold bread in their abandoned houses?
Whose father begged for mercy in the kitchen?
Whose memory will frame the photograph
and use the memory for what it was
never meant for by this girl, that old man, who was
caught on a ball field, near a window: war,
exhorted through the grief a photograph
revives. (Or was the team a covert branch
of a banned group; were maps drawn in the kitchen,
a bomb thrust in a hollowed loaf of bread?)
What did the old men pray for in their houses
of prayer, the teachers teach in schoolhouses
between blackouts and blasts, when each word was
flensed by new censure, books exchanged for bread,
both hostage to the happenstance of war?
Sometimes the only schoolroom is a kitchen.
Outside the window, black strokes on a graph
of broken glass, birds line up on bare branches.
“This letter curves, this one spreads its branches
like friends holding hands outside their houses.”
Was the lesson stopped by gunfire? Was
there panic, silence? Does a torn photograph
still gather children in the teacher’s kitchen?
Are they there meticulously learning war-
time lessons with the signs for house, book, bread?",0

"Doubt creeps in like a thief in the night,
Stealing the solid ground under my feet.
It wraps around my heart with all its might,
Whispering lies and planting deceit.

Uncertainty floods my mind and soul,
A torrent of anxiety and fear.
It rends the fabric of my being whole,
And leaves me feeling lost and unclear.

I question every thought and every choice,
Second-guessing even my own voice.
Is this the path I'm meant to take?
Or have I made a grave mistake?

Oh, doubt, you are a cruel and cunning foe,
A relentless adversary to my peace.
But though you try to overthrow,
I refuse to let you have the final say, cease!

For I know deep within my core,
That doubt is just a passing storm.
And though it may shake me to the core,
I will rise again, reborn.",1
"Being your slave, what should I do but tend
Upon the hours and times of your desire?
I have no precious time at all to spend,
Nor services to do, till you require.
Nor dare I chide the world-without-end hour
Whilst I, my sovereign, watch the clock for you.
Nor think the bitterness of absence sour
When you have bid your servant once adieu;
Nor dare I question with my jealous thought
Where you may be, or your affairs suppose,
But like a sad slave, stay and think of nought,
Save, where you are how happy you make those.
So true a fool is love that in your will
Though you do anything, he thinks no ill.",0

Then still with bright looks bless       The gay, the cold, the free; Give smiles to those who love you less,       But keep your tears for me. The snow on Jura’s steep       Can smile in many a beam, Yet still in chains of coldness sleep,       How bright soe’er it seem. But, when some deep-felt ray,       Whose touch is fire, appears, Oh, then the smile is warm’d away,       And, melting, turns to tears.

My heart feels a sweet release.

"The Melodies of the Heart's Symphony

Invisible notes of love and pain,
Whispers of joy and tears that stain,
A symphony crafted by the heart,
A masterpiece from the very start.

The strings play soft and tenderly,
As love's melody fills the reverie,
The beat of drums pounds with desire,
As passion builds like a raging fire.

A chorus of voices, sweet and pure,
Sings of hope, of faith, of love secure,
The flute plays a song of bittersweet,
As memories and dreams mix and meet.

The melody rises and falls with each breath,
Of emotions that bring life and death,
A symphony of life's own accord,
A masterpiece that can't be ignored.

So listen carefully to the heart's song,
And know that you are never alone,
For within its sweet and tender sound,
The answers to life's mysteries can be found.",1

Its waves, they crash and dance,
A symphony of ecstasy.

Lights sparkle in the night,
Like diamonds in the sand.

The sea sings its song,
A melody of ages past.
It whispers secrets unknown,
Of worlds that cannot last.

The ocean's angry roars,
A warning to beware.
The tranquility of its calm,
An invitation to come and share.

The waves that come and go,
Ebb and flow, as time rewinds.
The sea, a canvas of life,
A place where memories bind.

The sea, oh the sea,
A treasure trove of dreams.
Its salty embrace, a reminder,
That life is never what it seems.",1

"The hobby I admire is painting,
A skill of colors and creative awakening,
A way to express emotions so deep,
As if dipping your soul into a painting sleep.

With every stroke of the brush,
A splash of color can make a rush,
A painting is a masterpiece in the making,
With each color choice, excitement is shaking.

Patience is the key,
As a painting is a journey, not a spree,
A picture of serenity that takes time,
As the colors of the canvas slowly climb.

A painting is like a moment in time,
A frozen frame that becomes sublime,
As you stare at the painting with a sigh,
You can feel the artist's passion in the sky.

So, I admire the hobby of painting,
For the joy that it brings and the beauty it's making,
A gift to the world, for all to see,
A reflection of the artist's creativity.",1

A faded vine over the door, perhaps it was confiding something to us          —or grumbling to the faucet.

Infinite expanse, majestic sea
Waves rise and fall, a constant churn

A force of nature, a cosmic trance

Creatures great and small, secrets unfold
A world apart, uncharted lands
A realm of beauty, so vast, so grand

The sun sets and dips, into the sea
A golden glow, a fiery spree

A character so brave, so bold

A canyon's depths stretch far below,
Where streams and waterfalls do flow.

Great boulders lie in scattered heaps,
Among the trees and crests and steeps.
Their colors shift with changing light,
From gray to red and gold so bright.

The winding river winds its way,
Far down below where shadows play.
From here above, it looks so small,
Yet here it roars and rages all.

This place will be forever known,
As one of the great wonders shown.
A canyon deep and wide and grand,
A testament to nature's hand.",1
"Wolbe dich, Welt:
Wenn die Totenmuschel heranschwimmt,
will es hier läuten.
Vault over, world:
when the seashell of death washes up
there will be a knelling.
—Paul Celan, Stimmen (Voices)
Death knocks all night at my door.
The soul answers,
and runs from the water in my throat.
Water will sustain me when I climb
the steep hill
that leads to a now familiar place.
I began, even as a child, to learn water's order,
and, as I grew intact, the feel of its warmth
in a new sponge, of its weight in a virgin towel.
I have earned my wine in another's misery,
when rum bathed a sealed throat
and cast its seal on the ground.
I will be bound, to the one who leads me away,
by the ornaments on my wrists, the gold dust
in my ears, below my eye and tied to my
loincloth in a leather pouch.
They dress me now in my best cloth,
and fold my hands, adorned with silk,
against my left cheek.
Gold lies with me on my left side.
Gold has become the color of distance,
and of your sorrow.
Sorrow lies, red clay on my brow.
Red pepper caresses my temples.
I am adorned in the russet-brown message
the soul brings from its coming-to-be.
There is a silken despair in my body
that grief shakes from it,
a cat's voice, controlled by palm wine
and a widow's passion.
It is time to feed the soul
—a hen, eggs, mashed yams—
and encourage the thirst resting
near the right hand I see before me.
Always I think of death.
I cannot eat.
I walk in sadness, and I die.
Yet life is the invocation sealed in the coffin,
and will walk through our wall,
passing and passing and passing,
until it is set down,
to be lifted from this body's habitation.
I now assume the widow's pot,
the lamp that will lead me through solitude,
to the edge of my husband's journey.
I hold three stones upon my head,
darkness I will release when I run
from the dead,
with my eyes turned away
toward another light.
This is the day of rising.
A hut sits in the bush, sheltered by summe,
standing on four forked ends.
We have prepared for the soul's feast
with pestle, mortar, a strainer, three
hearthstones, a new pot and new spoon.
Someone has stripped the hut's body
and dressed it with the edowa.
Now, when the wine speaks
and the fire has lifted its voice,
the dead will be clothed in hair,
the signs of our grief.
Sun closes down on an intensity of ghosts.
It is time to close the path.
It is time for the snail's pace
of coming again into life,
with the world swept clean,
the crying done,
and our ordinary garments decent in the dead one's eyes.",0

"The great pulsation passed. Glass lay around me
Resurrected from the end. I walked
Along streets of slate-jabbering houses,
Against an acrid cloud of dust, I saw
The houses kneel, revealed each in its abject
Prayer, my prayer as well: 'Oh God,
Spare me the lot that is my neighbour's.'
Then, in the upper sky, indifferent to our
Sulphurous nether hell, I saw
The dead of the bombed graveyard, a calm tide
Under the foam of stars above the town.
And on the roof-tops there stood London prophets
Saints of Covent Garden, Parliament Hill Fields,
Hampstead, Hyde Park Corner, Saint John's Wood,
Crying aloud in cockney fanatic voices:
'In the midst of Life is Death!' They kneeled
And prayed against the misery manufactured
In mines and ships and mills, against
The greed of merchants, vanity of priests.
They sang: 'We souls from the abyss
To whom the stars are fields of flowers,
Tell you: Rejoice in the abyss!
For hollow is the skull, the vacuum
In the gold ball, St Paul's gold cross.
Unless you will accept the emptiness
Within the bells of foxgloves and cathedrals,
Each life must feed upon the deaths of others,
The shamelessly entreating prayer
Of every house will be that it is spared
Calamity that strikes its neighbour.'",0

Years ago, after hearing the story
About a boy who lost
Both legs while playing on an oil pump,
I was dared to straddle one.
All my friends were there to watch
The Pacific behind me burning with dusk.
The brute lifted me to the sky,
Where I merged with the twilight,
A warm breeze embracing my back.
None of them noticed

The girl who’d been missing for weeks.
They stood in awe, the body
Decomposing, while I rode
The slow bucking animal.
Two months later, off the same pump,
A man dove,
An imperfect swan into night.
He landed in the dirt gully
Breaking the soft, white wings
He never had.
Today, I catch in my hand
An insect charged with lightning.
It tickles
The obscure scoop of my palm
As I hold it to my mouth and explain

A brutal dryness in its wake.

But the air is thick with a stench like meat.
The sun shines bright, but the sky is grey,

Protecting those who cannot start,
Lifting them up with his ardent art.

With strength and passion in his soul,
He stands tall, a towering goal,
Inspiring us to reach our own role,
To become heroes too, to spread love and to console.

In battles fought and battles won,
His bravery shines like the sun,
His deeds are etched in tales that run,
For eternity, his heroism goes on and on.

With every step, he blazes a trail,
Making the impossible seem not so frail,
Our hero, he will never fail,
The embodiment of hope and never stale.

So let us honor the hero today,
Let us pave the way to a brighter way,
With his spirit at the helm, we'll never stray,
For he is forever in our hearts, and shall always stay.",1
"In the depth of space, there’s a galaxy
That fills me with wonder and awe
It’s a place of beauty and mystery
That leaves me breathless, in awe

The stars shine so bright in its sky
Each one with its own story to tell
The nebulae are a painter’s delight
With colors that swirl and swell

The planets are like jewels in the night
Each one a discovery to call my own
The moons around them, a wondrous sight
Their beauty has forever grown

The black hole that centers the galaxy
May be daunting to some, but not me
It holds the key to the universe’s mystery
A grand design, a cosmic symphony

This galaxy, my darling, my beloved
Is a treasure I hold close to my heart
Its secrets, its beauty, its grandeur
Are a lifelong love affair, never to part.",1
"A broken heart mends, piece by piece,
With threads of hope and resilience.
Each bit sewn with a careful seam,
Each stitch a sign of persistence.

The journey to mend a shattered heart
May seem endless and overbearing,
But with time and a steadfast spirit,
The hurt begins to start repairing.

It starts with one small piece in place,
And slowly grows piece by piece.
The warmth of hope begins to fill,
And the heart learns how to release.

With each thread that's pulled and tied,
The heart grows stronger by measure.
As pain transitions to healing,
The heart is showered with treasure.

For every moment of sorrow deep,
There's a new dawn waiting to break.
For every memory that's been lost,
There's a new promise to make.

So if you're burdened by a broken heart,
Don't fret or fear the repair.
Your heart can be put back together,
With the threads of hope and care.",1

"And place is always and only place
And what is actual is actual only for one time
And only for one place . . .
T. S. Eliot
The wind cooled as it crossed the open pond
and drove little waves toward us,
brisk, purposeful waves
that vanished at our feet, such energy
thwarted by so little elevation.
The wind was endless, seamless,
old as the earth.
Insects came
to regard us with favor. I felt them alight,
felt their minute footfalls.
I was a challenge, an Everest . . .
And you, whom I have heard breathe all night,
sigh through the water of sleep
with vestigial gills . . .
A pair of dragonflies drifted past us, silent,
while higher up two bullet-shaped jets
dragged their roars behind them
on unbreakable chains. It seemed a pity
we’d given up the sky to them, but I understand so little.
Perhaps it was necessary.
All our years together—
and not just together. Surely by now
we have the same blood type, the same myopia.
Sometimes I think we’re the same sex,
the one in the middle of man and woman,
born of both as every child is.
The waves came to us, one each heartbeat,
and lay themselves at our feet.
The swelling goes down.
The fever cools.
There, where the Hartleys grew lettuce eighty years ago
bear and beaver, fox and partridge
den and nest and hunt
and are hunted. I wish I had the means
to give all the north back to itself, to let the pines
rise in the hayfield and the lilacs go wild.
But then where would we live?
I wanted that hour with you all winter—
I thought of it while I worked,
before I slept and when I woke,
a time when the tangled would straighten,
when contrition would become benediction:
the positive hour, shining like mica.
At last the wind brought it to us across the pond,
then took it up again, every last minute.",0
"The odor of feet
Makes me want to retreat
It's dank and musty
And just a wee bit rusty

It clings to the air
No escaping from there
It's hard to ignore
As it seeps through the door

It reminds me of sweat
And feeling upset
The stench is so strong
It just feels all wrong

I try to ignore
But it's hard to endure
This smell of disdain
Makes me want to refrain

So I hold my breath
And pray for some fresh
Air to come in
And clear out the sin

I dislike this smell
And it's hard to sell
That it has a place
In any kind of space.",1
"My notebook has remained blank for months thanks to the light you shower around me. I have no use for my pen, which lies languorously without grief. Nothing is better than to live a storyless life that needs no writing for meaning— when I am gone, let others say they lost a happy man, though no one can tell how happy I was.",0
"As days go by and years unfold,
The whispers of time so loudly told.
The body moves a little slower,
The mind sometimes a little lower.

Once a youthful spirit shone so bright,
But now it's dimmed by time's long flight.
Memories of yesteryear still remain,
Like embers in a fire that still contain.

The wrinkles on the face now show,
The love, the laughter, the joy and woe.
A life well-lived, tis' plain to see,
A tale of happiness and mystery.

The eyes once bright now see the past,
They watched the world's growth and contrast.
The hands that once held life's sweet fruits,
Now cherish moments that time disputes.

Each day anew, a blessing in sight,
A marking of time, a graceful flight.
Aging is not to be feared or shunned,
But embraced and cherished in the end.

For as we age, we gather strength,
We gain wisdom and inner length.
The soul is eternally youthful and bright,
And in its shining, we find delight.",1

There's a world hidden from us all
Where fairies dance and fairies play
And they flourish in every way

With delicate wings and magic dust
Their beauty is pure and just
In glowing colors, they flutter by
Their peaceful presence, never shy

The fairies dance in the moonlight
Their movements graceful and bright
With gentle whispers they sing a song
And bring peace to everything they touch

Their magic is real, so they say
In every forest, they show the way
To a world full of hope and glee
Where everything is possible to see

Composing a lullaby for the weary souls.  
The pitter-patter of each drop,  
Soothes the heart and makes it whole.  

As each raindrop taps the shingles,  
A rhythm is formed in the night.  
Softly singing, the tune tingles,  
The ears of those seeking respite.  

The symphony of the rain,  
Plays a melody of peace and calm.  
No longer feeling any pain,  
The weary souls are charmed.  

Raindrops tap-dance on rooftops,  
Composing a lullaby for the weary souls.  
With each splash, a dream propels  
A restful sleep, that makes them whole.

And let the thunder strike the sky.  
For in this storm, peace is found,  
And restful dreams can multiply.

"White-Mexican looks like a Latina,
not my label
a question
from a Guatemalan student
who's come undone
in my ESL class,
doesn't get my kind
I try to describe
how I grew up
in Caucasian corn country
surrounded by houses
on cul-de-sacs
that all looked the same,
how we were alone
in a town of 5000,
one black family,
one Indian family,
one Asian family,
and one household of Mexicans,
no two, us and the Renterias
to whom we were related by marriage
before and after my divorce,
and they were mixed;
still, it was a good living,
happy in our cocooness,
our oneness,
separated by money
one direction
color on the other:
classes, classes, classes,
day and night
we took lessons:
piano, jazz, tap, ballet,
the dance team, trumpet,
trombone, tennis, Finishing School,
and one awful summer golf;
Christened, Confirmed, Cathechismized;
it all cut me in several places,
molding of head and heart
making me ultrasensitive,
then and now,
an observer of the outside,
an outsider among my own kind,
my very shade,
mysterious aloof
black haired beauty
who can't speak Spanish,
living among blue eyed dyed blond bombshells,
who held up her head higher
because she's shy not stuck-up,
understood, undenied, sacrificed to at any price
by my beloved little brown parents
who taught me well
gave up so much
so their daughters could shine
and they'd swell with pride
at the life they had given us,
on Sundays we basked
in mutual admiration after mass
singing our church songs while making breakfast,
according to the unspoken doctrine in our house of:
fast first eat later after communion,
we intruded with our Mexican music
bellowing out the open windows
the smell of bacon frying,
pancakes baking, coffee
and eggs scrambled to order
it wafted out on beautiful summer mornings
out of our house in Pleasant Hill, Iowa,
perched on the highest spot
one could reach on the East Side of the street
for first and second generation immigrants.

"There's a land I long to see
Where palm trees sway in a gentle breeze
Crystal waters stretch out to the horizon
A paradise that's nothing short of awe-inspiring

The sun beats down with an unrelenting heat
But the people, oh, the people, they can't be beat
With a smile always on their faces
They welcome you to their warm and happy places

The food is nothing short of divine
From sweet desserts to savory wines
Spices dance on your tongue
While laughter fills the air, everyone's having fun

I dream of exploring its cities and towns
So rich in culture to be found
The music, the dance, the art, the fashion
All come together in a beautiful fusion

So, I'll pack my bags and take to the sky
To the paradise that's caught my eye
I'll marvel at the natural beauty
And embrace the kindness of its people's generosity

For this country that I've longed to visit
Is a dream come true, I can't wait to experience it
A place where the heart and the soul combine
This is the place where I want to spend my time.",1
"The jaunty crop-haired graying
Women in grocery stores,
Their clothes boyish and neat,
New mittens or clean sneakers,
Clean hands, hips not bad still,
Buying ice cream, steaks, soda,
Fresh melons and soap—or the big
Balding young men in work shoes
And green work pants, beer belly
And white T-shirt, the porky walk
Back to the truck, polite; possible
To feel briefly like Jesus,
A gust of diffuse tenderness
Crossing the dark spaces
To where the dry self burrows
Or nests, something that stirs,
Watching the kinds of people
On the street for a while—
But how love falters and flags
When anyone’s difficult eyes come
Into focus, terrible gaze of a unique
Soul, its need unlovable: my friend
In his divorced schoolteacher
Apartment, his own unsuspected
Paintings hung everywhere,
Which his wife kept in a closet—
Not, he says, that she wasn’t
Perfectly right; or me, mis-hearing
My rock radio sing my self-pity:
“The Angels Wished Him Dead”—all
The hideous, sudden stare of self,
Soul showing through like the lizard
Ancestry showing in the frontal gaze
Of a robin busy on the lawn.
In the movies, when the sensitive
Young Jewish soldier nearly drowns
Trying to rescue the thrashing
Anti-semitic bully, swimming across
The river raked by nazi fire,
The awful part is the part truth:Hate my whole kind, but me,
Love me for myself. The weather
Changes in the black of night,
And the dream-wind, bowling across
The sopping open spaces
Of roads, golf courses, parking lots,
Flails a commotion
In the dripping treetops,
Tries a half-rotten shingle
Or a down-hung branch, and we
All dream it, the dark wind crossing
The wide spaces between us.",0
"As I sat and pondered on what to do,
I reached for my controller, I knew what to pursue.
A game I often played, one that brought so much joy,
I quickly pressed start, a feeling of excitement to employ.

The loading screen flickered, the game started to load,
As I sat and waited, I was ready to hit the road.
The music softly played, anticipation building inside,
I was ready to enter the world that I'd forever abide.

The game was a journey, one that I'd never forget,
A quest that I'd take, until the very last sunset.
The characters were alive, the landscape so surreal,
A game that enveloped me in a world that felt so real.

I conquered each level, overcame every test,
With each new challenge, I felt I did my very best.
My strategy in place, I tackled each foe,
I won and I lost, but never let my spirit go low.

The game was a challenge but it was one I enjoyed,
To conquer each level and see it be destroyed.
I smiled as I played, grateful for the escape,
A game that ignited my imagination, from which I couldn't escape.

As the credits rolled, my time in the game was done,
But I knew I'd come back, until this journey was won.
The game was my world, my escape, my retreat,
Forever grateful for a game that brought me so much treat.",1
"Once I was seized by fear,
It made my thoughts so unclear,
I trembled at the thought,
Of losing everything I had sought.

It took hold of my mind,
And left no peace to find,
I was afraid of what could be,
Of the unknown, that I could not see.

But one day I decided,
That fear could not have me blinded,
So I took a step forward,
Towards my fear, I began to move toward.

My fear began to lose its grip,
As I took step by step,
I confronted what I once thought,
Was something that could not be fought.

I realized then and there,
That fear was all a dare,
To stay and not move on,
To stay in darkness and not face the sun.

Now fear no longer holds me tight,
In the open, I stand and fight,
And when fears come back to scare,
I am ready, always aware.

For I have conquered my fear,
And it's no longer near,
It no longer makes me quake,
For I have learnt, fear is what we make.",1

"For RWT
the other day i was thinking about the term pyramid scheme, and why they called it pyramid scheme and not triangle scheme
and i asked you what you thought
you thought it added a certain gravitas, and linked the idea of  economic prosperity
with some of history’s greatest architectural achievements
unconsciously suggesting a silent wealth of gold and heat
a triangle is two dimensional, and therefore
a less striking mental image than the idea of a third dimension of financial fraud
which is how many dimensions of financial fraud the term pyramid scheme suggests
but i had to pause for a second at the financial fraud part
because it occurred to me i didn’t know what pyramid schemes really were
i knew they had something to do with people getting money from nothing
like
the person at the top of the pyramid scheme, or more accurately
triangle scheme, acquires a number of investors and takes their money
and then pays the first lot of investors with the money from another bunch of investors
and so on and so forth
all the way to the bottom of the triangle
or pyramid face
which is the kind of stupid thing that happens
if you keep your money in a pyramid and not a bank account
although if you ask me banks are the real pyramid schemes after all
or was love the real pyramid scheme? i can’t remember
maybe it’s better to keep your money in a pyramid than a bank
and i should shop around and compare the interest rates on different pyramids
maybe i should open up a savings pyramid
with a whole bunch of trapdoors and malarias
to keep the financial anthropologists
i mean bankers out
my emeralds cooling under the ground like beautiful women’s eyes
i think this was supposed to be a metaphor for something
but i can’t remember where i was going with it
and now it’s been swept away by the winds of
whatever
but knowing me, it was probably love
that great dark blue sex hope that keeps coming true
that cartoon black castle with a single bird flying over it
i don’t know where this poem ends
how far below the sand
but it’s still early evening
and you and I are a little drunk
you answer the phone
you pour me a drink
i know you hate the domestic in poetry but you should have thought of that before you invited me to move in with you
i used to think arguments were the same as honesty
i used to think screaming was the same as passion
i used to think pain was meaningful
i no longer think pain is meaningful
i never learned anything good from being unhappy
i never learned anything good from being happy either
the way i feel about you has nothing to do with learning
it has nothing to do with anything
but i feel it down in the corners of my sarcophagus
i feel it in my sleep
even when i am not thinking about you
you are still pouring through my blood, like fire through an abandoned hospital ward
these coins are getting heavy on my eyes
it has been a great honor and privilege to love you
it has been a great honor and privilege to eat cold pizza on your steps at dawn
love is so stupid: it’s like punching the sun
and having a million gold coins rain down on you
which you don’t even have to pay tax on
because sun money is free money
and i’m pretty sure there are no laws about that
but i would pay tax
because i believe that hospitals and education
and the arts should be publicly funded
even this poem
when i look at you, my eyes are two identical neighborhood houses on fire
when i look at you my eyes bulge out of my skull like a dog in a cartoon
when i am with you
an enormous silence descends upon me
and i feel like i am sinking into the deepest part of my life
we walk down the street, with the grass blowing back and forth
i have never been so happy",0
"In midst of chaos, we wage a war,
A battle long, with no end in sight,
With tears and blood, we search for more,
To conquer lands, and claim the right.

The sound of guns, echoes loud,
As missiles fly, through the sky,
The earth trembles, beneath the crowd,
As we speak of peace, with a sigh.

For every life, we take with pride,
A thousand more, will rise in scorn,
And in this cycle, we cannot hide,
As we continue, to be reborn.

The screams of agony, we hear,
As we watch, our brothers fall,
And in this darkness, we fear,
That we may never end it all.

For war is not a game we play,
It's a tragedy, we cannot deny,
And in the end, we always pay,
As we stand alone, wondering why.

So let us pray, for peace to come,
And end this violence, once and for all,
For we are all but dust, and some,
Who can hear the call.",1

It does sound sweet to-day.”Sweeter I never heard, mother, no, not in all Wales.I should like to be lying under that foam,Dead, but able to hear the sound of the bell,And certain that you would often comeAnd rest, listening happily.I should be happy if that could be.",0
"Color surrounds us all around,
In every shape and every sound,
A rainbow of hues so bright and bold,
Painting memories, stories untold.

Blue like a clear sky above,
A peaceful calm, a messenger of love,
Red like a flaming heart on fire,
A passion that never will expire.

Green like a verdant meadow's floor,
A space to grow, to explore,
Yellow like a warming sun,
A cheerful glow that's never undone.

Purple like a royal decree,
A majesty untold and free,
Orange like a vibrant flame,
A dancing light, there's no shame.

Colors are the language of the soul,
A symphony of life, a tale to behold,
May we always cherish their beauty and light,
And hold them close, day and night.",1
"To the gentlemen from the south
to the tourists from the north
who write poems about the south
to the dumb-ass students
I’d like to ask one lousy question
have you ever seen a regatta of flies
sail around a pile of shit
and then come back and picnic on the shit
just once in your life have you heard
flies on shit
because I cut my eye teeth on flies
floating in shit",0
"In the stillness of the night,
I hear Solitude's serenade,
Softly sung, yet with might,
A tune that doesn't fade.

Loneliness creeps in my soul,
But the melody keeps me whole,
It tells me that I'm not alone,
That I'm not the only one on my own.

And as I close my eyes to rest,
I let the rhythm lull me to sleep,
For in Solitude's embrace,
I find release, I find peace.

Solitude's serenade whispers,
A promise of a new tomorrow,
Full of hope, full of wonder,
And I know I'll find my way out of sorrow.

So let the symphony play on,
Let Solitude's melodic voice,
Guide me through darkness and dawn,
And help me make the right choice.",1
"Growth is not always easy,
It can be painful and hard,
But as we reach towards the sky,
We become who we're meant to be.

From a small seed in the earth,
To a mighty tree in the sky,
We grow and change with the world,
And learn to spread our wings and fly.

There are challenges along the way,
Moments when we stumble and fall,
But with each step we take,
We become stronger and stand tall.

As we grow, we learn to see,
The beauty in the ups and downs,
And we find joy in the journey,
As we reach higher ground.

So let us keep on growing,
In all that we do and say,
For with each new day that dawns,
We become wiser and more brave.",1
"the rooms are chosen, then they move on
the beads are wetted in the lime
the weedlot boils in the blood of one eye
the children first are cankered then they spin
there are not routes, only dials
the rocks are spun together in one ball
the laundry is of rust, the pillow shrieks
pianos all blow northward and return
must be a bath if  I could find it is a map
of all the ways that center intermission
skulls are simply caps for all compression
day’s light raising closets for its dark
I put up the clothes and trail the keys
that onyx knob in vacuum turns the train
pressure on the pitches swaying back again
a world without a heartbeat but it stays",0
"In the midnight hour
when the stars blaze bright
and the world is at rest,
my dreams take flight.

A symphony of colors
swirls and dances with glee
as I drift off to a world
only my mind can see.

The sound of a thousand voices
echoes through my soul
as my dreams come alive
and my heart takes control.

In this magical place
where anything is possible
I am free to be
the person that I know I can be.

And when the morning light
shines upon my face
I am grateful for the gift
of this symphony of dreams.",1

Remember seasons? Seem to recall those once were easier.
Reasonably sequenced, regal of tempo and temper,
Reliable change flipped heads-over-tails each quarter,
Recovering the hemisphere with four fine suits, knock-off designer.

Reading required to diagnose this crazy weather:
Record highs, flourishing lows. April even crueler
Recapitulated each fortnight. Spring hailing like a howitzer.
Reek of summer tickling autumn’s automatic sprinkler.
Redder-neck sunbathers burnt by November’s toaster. A warbler
Retweeting Keats, well into winter. A death for Easter.ii. funeral: march

Remark, the dead are never passed. Ask: will this chapter
Retain familiar cycles? Lather, rinse, repeat. Swelter,

"That which installs itself in the mind embraces sound

"Comrades, leave me here a little, while as yet 't is early morn:
Leave me here, and when you want me, sound upon the bugle-horn.
'T is the place, and all around it, as of old, the curlews call,
Dreary gleams about the moorland flying over Locksley Hall;
Locksley Hall, that in the distance overlooks the sandy tracts,
And the hollow ocean-ridges roaring into cataracts.
Many a night from yonder ivied casement, ere I went to rest,
Did I look on great Orion sloping slowly to the West.
Many a night I saw the Pleiads, rising thro' the mellow shade,
Glitter like a swarm of fire-flies tangled in a silver braid.
Here about the beach I wander'd, nourishing a youth sublime
With the fairy tales of science, and the long result of Time;
When the centuries behind me like a fruitful land reposed;
When I clung to all the present for the promise that it closed:
When I dipt into the future far as human eye could see;
Saw the Vision of the world and all the wonder that would be.—
In the Spring a fuller crimson comes upon the robin's breast;
In the Spring the wanton lapwing gets himself another crest;
In the Spring a livelier iris changes on the burnish'd dove;
In the Spring a young man's fancy lightly turns to thoughts of love.
Then her cheek was pale and thinner than should be for one so young,
And her eyes on all my motions with a mute observance hung.
And I said, ""My cousin Amy, speak, and speak the truth to me,
Trust me, cousin, all the current of my being sets to thee.""
On her pallid cheek and forehead came a colour and a light,
As I have seen the rosy red flushing in the northern night.
And she turn'd—her bosom shaken with a sudden storm of sighs—
All the spirit deeply dawning in the dark of hazel eyes—
Saying, ""I have hid my feelings, fearing they should do me wrong"";
Saying, ""Dost thou love me, cousin?"" weeping, ""I have loved thee long.""
Love took up the glass of Time, and turn'd it in his glowing hands;
Every moment, lightly shaken, ran itself in golden sands.
Love took up the harp of Life, and smote on all the chords with might;
Smote the chord of Self, that, trembling, pass'd in music out of sight.
Many a morning on the moorland did we hear the copses ring,
And her whisper throng'd my pulses with the fulness of the Spring.
Many an evening by the waters did we watch the stately ships,
And our spirits rush'd together at the touching of the lips.
O my cousin, shallow-hearted! O my Amy, mine no more!
O the dreary, dreary moorland! O the barren, barren shore!
Falser than all fancy fathoms, falser than all songs have sung,
Puppet to a father's threat, and servile to a shrewish tongue!
Is it well to wish thee happy?—having known me—to decline
On a range of lower feelings and a narrower heart than mine!
Yet it shall be; thou shalt lower to his level day by day,
What is fine within thee growing coarse to sympathize with clay.
As the husband is, the wife is: thou art mated with a clown,
And the grossness of his nature will have weight to drag thee down.
He will hold thee, when his passion shall have spent its novel force,
Something better than his dog, a little dearer than his horse.
What is this? his eyes are heavy; think not they are glazed with wine.
Go to him, it is thy duty, kiss him, take his hand in thine.
It may be my lord is weary, that his brain is overwrought:
Soothe him with thy finer fancies, touch him with thy lighter thought.
He will answer to the purpose, easy things to understand—
Better thou wert dead before me, tho' I slew thee with my hand!
Better thou and I were lying, hidden from the heart's disgrace,
Roll'd in one another's arms, and silent in a last embrace.
Cursed be the social wants that sin against the strength of youth!
Cursed be the social lies that warp us from the living truth!
Cursed be the sickly forms that err from honest Nature's rule!
Cursed be the gold that gilds the straiten'd forehead of the fool!
Well—'t is well that I should bluster!—Hadst thou less unworthy proved—
Would to God—for I had loved thee more than ever wife was loved.
Am I mad, that I should cherish that which bears but bitter fruit?
I will pluck it from my bosom, tho' my heart be at the root.
Never, tho' my mortal summers to such length of years should come
As the many-winter'd crow that leads the clanging rookery home.
Where is comfort? in division of the records of the mind?
Can I part her from herself, and love her, as I knew her, kind?
I remember one that perish'd; sweetly did she speak and move;
Such a one do I remember, whom to look at was to love.
Can I think of her as dead, and love her for the love she bore?
No—she never loved me truly; love is love for evermore.
Comfort? comfort scorn'd of devils! this is truth the poet sings,
That a sorrow's crown of sorrow is remembering happier things.
Drug thy memories, lest thou learn it, lest thy heart be put to proof,
In the dead unhappy night, and when the rain is on the roof.
Like a dog, he hunts in dreams, and thou art staring at the wall,
Where the dying night-lamp flickers, and the shadows rise and fall.
Then a hand shall pass before thee, pointing to his drunken sleep,
To thy widow'd marriage-pillows, to the tears that thou wilt weep.
Thou shalt hear the ""Never, never,"" whisper'd by the phantom years,
And a song from out the distance in the ringing of thine ears;
And an eye shall vex thee, looking ancient kindness on thy pain.
Turn thee, turn thee on thy pillow; get thee to thy rest again.
Nay, but Nature brings thee solace; for a tender voice will cry.
'T is a purer life than thine, a lip to drain thy trouble dry.
Baby lips will laugh me down; my latest rival brings thee rest.
Baby fingers, waxen touches, press me from the mother's breast.
O, the child too clothes the father with a dearness not his due.
Half is thine and half is his: it will be worthy of the two.
O, I see thee old and formal, fitted to thy petty part,
With a little hoard of maxims preaching down a daughter's heart.
""They were dangerous guides the feelings—she herself was not exempt—
Truly, she herself had suffer'd""—Perish in thy self-contempt!
Overlive it—lower yet—be happy! wherefore should I care?
I myself must mix with action, lest I wither by despair.
What is that which I should turn to, lighting upon days like these?
Every door is barr'd with gold, and opens but to golden keys.
Every gate is throng'd with suitors, all the markets overflow.
I have but an angry fancy; what is that which I should do?
I had been content to perish, falling on the foeman's ground,
When the ranks are roll'd in vapour, and the winds are laid with sound.
But the jingling of the guinea helps the hurt that Honour feels,
And the nations do but murmur, snarling at each other's heels.
Can I but relive in sadness? I will turn that earlier page.
Hide me from my deep emotion, O thou wondrous Mother-Age!
Make me feel the wild pulsation that I felt before the strife,
When I heard my days before me, and the tumult of my life;
Yearning for the large excitement that the coming years would yield,
Eager-hearted as a boy when first he leaves his father's field,
And at night along the dusky highway near and nearer drawn,
Sees in heaven the light of London flaring like a dreary dawn;
And his spirit leaps within him to be gone before him then,
Underneath the light he looks at, in among the throngs of men:
Men, my brothers, men the workers, ever reaping something new:
That which they have done but earnest of the things that they shall do:
For I dipt into the future, far as human eye could see,
Saw the Vision of the world, and all the wonder that would be;
Saw the heavens fill with commerce, argosies of magic sails,
Pilots of the purple twilight dropping down with costly bales;
Heard the heavens fill with shouting, and there rain'd a ghastly dew
From the nations' airy navies grappling in the central blue;
Far along the world-wide whisper of the south-wind rushing warm,
With the standards of the peoples plunging thro' the thunder-storm;
Till the war-drum throbb'd no longer, and the battle-flags were furl'd
In the Parliament of man, the Federation of the world.
There the common sense of most shall hold a fretful realm in awe,
And the kindly earth shall slumber, lapt in universal law.
So I triumph'd ere my passion sweeping thro' me left me dry,
Left me with the palsied heart, and left me with the jaundiced eye;
Eye, to which all order festers, all things here are out of joint:
Science moves, but slowly, slowly, creeping on from point to point:
Slowly comes a hungry people, as a lion, creeping nigher,
Glares at one that nods and winks behind a slowly-dying fire.
Yet I doubt not thro' the ages one increasing purpose runs,
And the thoughts of men are widen'd with the process of the suns.
What is that to him that reaps not harvest of his youthful joys,
Tho' the deep heart of existence beat for ever like a boy's?
Knowledge comes, but wisdom lingers, and I linger on the shore,
And the individual withers, and the world is more and more.
Knowledge comes, but wisdom lingers, and he bears a laden breast,
Full of sad experience, moving toward the stillness of his rest.
Hark, my merry comrades call me, sounding on the bugle-horn,
They to whom my foolish passion were a target for their scorn:
Shall it not be scorn to me to harp on such a moulder'd string?
I am shamed thro' all my nature to have loved so slight a thing.
Weakness to be wroth with weakness! woman's pleasure, woman's pain—
Nature made them blinder motions bounded in a shallower brain:
Woman is the lesser man, and all thy passions, match'd with mine,
Are as moonlight unto sunlight, and as water unto wine—
Here at least, where nature sickens, nothing. Ah, for some retreat
Deep in yonder shining Orient, where my life began to beat;
Where in wild Mahratta-battle fell my father evil-starr'd,—
I was left a trampled orphan, and a selfish uncle's ward.
Or to burst all links of habit—there to wander far away,
On from island unto island at the gateways of the day.
Larger constellations burning, mellow moons and happy skies,
Breadths of tropic shade and palms in cluster, knots of Paradise.
Never comes the trader, never floats an European flag,
Slides the bird o'er lustrous woodland, swings the trailer from the crag;
Droops the heavy-blossom'd bower, hangs the heavy-fruited tree—
Summer isles of Eden lying in dark-purple spheres of sea.
There methinks would be enjoyment more than in this march of mind,
In the steamship, in the railway, in the thoughts that shake mankind.
There the passions cramp'd no longer shall have scope and breathing space;
I will take some savage woman, she shall rear my dusky race.
Iron-jointed, supple-sinew'd, they shall dive, and they shall run,
Catch the wild goat by the hair, and hurl their lances in the sun;
Whistle back the parrot's call, and leap the rainbows of the brooks,
Not with blinded eyesight poring over miserable books—
Fool, again the dream, the fancy! but I know my words are wild,
But I count the gray barbarian lower than the Christian child.
I, to herd with narrow foreheads, vacant of our glorious gains,
Like a beast with lower pleasures, like a beast with lower pains!
Mated with a squalid savage—what to me were sun or clime?
I the heir of all the ages, in the foremost files of time—
I that rather held it better men should perish one by one,
Than that earth should stand at gaze like Joshua's moon in Ajalon!
Not in vain the distance beacons. Forward, forward let us range,
Let the great world spin for ever down the ringing grooves of change.
Thro' the shadow of the globe we sweep into the younger day;
Better fifty years of Europe than a cycle of Cathay.
Mother-Age (for mine I knew not) help me as when life begun:
Rift the hills, and roll the waters, flash the lightnings, weigh the Sun.
O, I see the crescent promise of my spirit hath not set.
Ancient founts of inspiration well thro' all my fancy yet.
Howsoever these things be, a long farewell to Locksley Hall!
Now for me the woods may wither, now for me the roof-tree fall.
Comes a vapour from the margin, blackening over heath and holt,
Cramming all the blast before it, in its breast a thunderbolt.
Let it fall on Locksley Hall, with rain or hail, or fire or snow;
For the mighty wind arises, roaring seaward, and I go.",0
"In a land of dreams and wonder,
Where reality fades asunder,
Lies a world of pure imagination,
Unbounded by earthly limitation.

Here the sky is always bright,
And the stars shine day and night,
The fireflies dance with grace,
And the unicorns roam with grace.

Dragons fly freely up on high,
With their wings spread wide in the sky,
Sailing through clouds of cotton candy,
In a landscape that’s nothing but dandy.

Mermaids swim beneath the waves,
With their tails and scales unique in ways,
Singing songs that enchant and amaze,
Melodies that never cease to blaze.

The fairies sprinkle magic dust,
Making nature more beautiful in every thrust,
And the elves play their tunes,
Creating music that never ends or swoons.

This is a world of never-ending fantasy,
Full of magic and beauty that is simply tasty,
A world where dreams are always alive,
And reality fades away, unable to thrive.",1

An Ireland, as of chalk, the sky
standing in for the sea, the beach
a reach of blue, the vineyards’
green scooped out in cirque,
in cove, a subtlety of air laps
the eyes, abob like barques
come from afar, and the viator
standing there, poised to dis-
embark, the undercurrent of air
escaping him, tossed to & fro,
gaze wrenched from its angle
of purchase upon the world,
capsized, head now careened
against the suddenness
of rock, eyes whiplashed into new
prospects, he drowns in fire,
enflamed, fine silk aquiver
at the singe of brazier, he
burns: would Hell be as blue,
or the sun the obverse of God?

Now at Laon, the Lugdunum
of the North, deposited on this citadel
of chalk, white arx, former
temple of Lug, the light-
god of the Gauls, & he,
this Celt from Hibernia, setting
foot on this podium, this puy,
this platform afloat
at cloud & wind height,
blown in from the septentrion,
breathes in the quintessence
of rains, alevel the briar’s
pinks, zone where water,
at first cold snap, turns to snow.
Fallen from fire. Autumn’s pure light
whitens the mount, the tufa
reverberating the radiance
of a Cyclades isle, here mis-
placed, high above these plains,
by some error in translation.

At Lindisfarne, let us suppose —
even if Alcuin’s letters to the island’s
monks exhorting them to combat
the Viking may be evidence
to the contrary — that he studied
Greek, that Charles the Bald,
offshoot of the Pippinids,
summoned him here to Laon
to translate Dionysus. Between
the king’s vineyards & the blue sky,
a whisper of the North Sea
in the channel of Île Sainte when
the seals bark at ebb tide,
Johannes the Hibernian cocks an ear
despite finding his coracle of Latin
too frail a craft to explore the peninsulas
of Greek, & carries with him
the long-lapping waves of Scotland
& seaweed’s tang where kingfisher
nests beside nugget of amber.

That which lies out of reach taking
the shape of this white & shadowy
rock on which he is now beached
& whose slope he now climbs, blind
beneath the sun, fallen from the same height
he ascends, would Satan be extending him
his welcome with the same dark
radiance of stone between his eyes
& the same fine peppering of pinks
that spice his senses on either side
of the stairs, against this, what whiteness,
what candor? The sky’s rarified air,
there to calculate the distances between
the things he climbs or descends,
the divisions of the world now
extended, now illuminated between the lines,
the borders of the intangible now flaring up
with darkness, the granular opacities
now brightening, the sun biting into
the margins of the real, the image dying.

Denys, foundation of all cathedrals
to come, mentor of naves, stained glass

your Greek sailing the great hill
of Lugdunum, your darkness raining down
its alphas, its Alphei, the dawn
uncorking the fizz of its dations.
John Scotus comments, his violet ink
relighting, igniting the world according
to Plato, filtering the grit of the flower
through the sieve of the eye,
the bran, the curds of light,
sifting out the clots of theology,

burning every log in sight, hoc lignum,
a bonfire of stones
held in common, lapis iste.

"A symbol that holds so much power,
A message of hope in its tower,
It stands tall and proud,
In every corner, it's found.

A cross, a simple shape,
Yet, it holds a deep escape,
From pain, from sorrow,
It brings light to the morrow.

It's a symbol of redemption,
For every sin, every temptation,
For every life that's in need,
It's a sign of love to succeed.

This symbol is meaningful to me,
More than just what I can see,
It's a reminder of faith,
For every challenge we face.

In times of darkness and despair,
It brings comfort, it shows we care,
It's a beacon of hope in the night,
That guides us towards the light.

The cross represents a sacrifice,
Of a love that never dies,
It's a symbol of our salvation,
And an everlasting relation.

So, let us cherish this symbol,
And what it stands for in full,
For it's a message of peace,
And a love that will never cease.",1
"Whispers of the autumn leaves,
Echoing in the breeze,
Their rustling sound so soothing,
A melody that never sieges.

Dancing gently on the ground,
Colors of gold, yellow and brown,
A sight so serene and profound,
As they twirl without a sound.

With every passing day,
They fall and slowly decay,
Leaving memories of summers past,
And hopes for seasons yet to cast.

Whispers of the autumn leaves,
A chorus of farewell and relief,
As nature prepares for winter's arrival,
And a new beginning's revival.",1
"It was an Artless Poster Girl pinned up against my wall, She was tremendous ugly, she was exceeding tall; I was gazing at her idly, and I think I must have slept, For that poster maiden lifted up her poster voice, and wept. She said between her poster sobs, ‘I think it’s rather rough To be jeered and fleered and flouted, and I’ve stood it long enough; I’m tired of being quoted as a Fright and Fad and Freak, And I take this opportunity my poster mind to speak. ‘Although my hair is carmine and my nose is edged with blue, Although my style is splashy and my shade effects are few, Although I’m out of drawing and my back hair is a show, Yet I have n’t half the whimseys of the maidens that you know. ‘I never keep you waiting while I prink before the glass, I never talk such twaddle as that little Dawson lass, I never paint on china, nor erotic novels write, And I never have recited “Curfew must not ring tonight”. ‘I don’t rave over Ibsen, I never, never flirt, I never wear a shirt waist with a disconnected skirt; I never speak in public on “The Suffrage”, or “The Race”, I never talk while playing whist, or trump my partner’s ace.’ I said: ‘O artless Poster Girl, you’re in the right of it, You are a joy forever, though a thing of beauty, nit!’ And from her madder eyebrows to her utmost purple swirl, Against all captious critics I’ll defend the Poster Girl.",0
"When I was a young man, I loved to write poems
And I called a spade a spade
And the only only thing that made me sing
Was to lift the masks at the masquerade.
I took them off my own face,
I took them off others too
And the only only wrong in all my song
Was the view that I knew what was true.
Now I am older and tireder too
And the tasks with the masks are quite trying.
I’d gladly gladly stop if I only only knew
A better way to keep from lying,
And not get nervous and blue
When I said something quite untrue:
I looked all around and all over
To find something else to do:
I tried to be less romantic
I tried to be less starry-eyed too:
But I only got mixed up and frantic
Forgetting what was false and what was true.
But tonight I am going to the masked ball,
Because it has occurred to me
That the masks are more true than the faces:
—Perhaps this too is poetry?
I no longer yearn to be naïve and stern
And masked balls fascinate me:
Now that I know that most falsehoods are true
Perhaps I can join the charade?
This is, at any rate, my new and true view:
Let live and believe, I say.
The only only thing is to believe in everything:
It’s more fun and safer that way!",0
"Freedom, oh Freedom!

The sweetest sound to hear,
The joyous feeling so dear.
To roam far and wide,
Without any bounds to abide.

Freedom to breathe the air,
And be not scared to dare.
To live life on our terms,
And not be held by any norms.

Freedom to chase our dreams,
And be what we want to seem.
To shine bright like a star,
And never be held behind bars.

Freedom from hate and pain,
And to see the rainbow after the rain.
To live in harmony with all,
And hear the sounds of laughter's call.

Freedom, oh freedom,
The treasure we seek each day,
To live in peace and love,
And watch freedom pave the way.",1
"A blind man, on the thoroughfare,
Startle-eyed as an owl by day,
Piping a dismal little air,
Taps here and there, loses his way,
Tootles awry his time-old ditty
Undauntedly, as by his side
Lopes his dog, guides him through the city,
Specter diurnal, sleepy-eyed.
Days, stark, wash over him, unlit;
He hears the dark world’s constant din
And all that life unseen, as it
Rolls, rushing, like a flood walled in!
God knows what black chimeras haunt
That brain opaque, what lot befalls;
And what dire spells the mind is wont
To scribble on those death-vault walls!
Like prisoner grown half-mad, who, pent,
Rots beneath Venice in her jail
Eternal, and whose hours are spent
Scratching a message with a nail...
But when the torch, in tomb immured,
Dies in the breath of death, maybe
The soul, to shades’ gloom long inured,
Will see with deathly clarity!",0
"Twinkle, twinkle little star 
Up above the world so far 
Shining bright in the night sky 
Like diamonds that catch the eye 

Millions of stars dot the black 
Each one with a unique track 
Up there they seem so still and cold 
But secrets they hold yet untold 

Some stars are ancient, billions old 
Some are newborn, freshly unrolled 
Some are bright and some are dull 
Some are big and some are small 

Twinkle, twinkle little star 
You fill the cosmos near and far 
You teach us much about ourselves 
And how little we know about the shelves 

Up in the heavens, they hold 
Stories untold, and secrets foretold 
From them we can learn the history of time 
and eagerly we study what they mime 

So look up at night, see the stars 
Appreciate their beauty, forever afar 
For they are the guardians of the sky 
And remind us of the endlessness of life.",1
"I miss you deeply,
My dear friend.
Memories of you
Refuse to end.

Your laughter echoes
In my mind,
Your words of wisdom
So hard to find.

The warmth of your embrace,
The comfort of your touch,
I miss all of these,
It's been too much.

I long to hear
Your voice again,
To see your smile
And just be with a friend.

But though you're gone,
You're not forgotten,
The love we shared
Will never soften.

And so I'll wait,
For the day we meet,
Until then, my friend,
Know that you're still sweet.",1
"The storm has come, with all its might
A roaring beast, fierce and bright
Its winds howl and its lightning strikes
And heaven's tears come down in spikes

Tall trees sway like they're mere grass
While rooftops fly, debris amassed
The sky turns dark, the air grows cold
And the thunder's voice just won't go old

The storm, it seems, won't ever cease
A chaos of fury, a monstrous beast
But as it rages, we still hold tight
And weather through, come day or night

For after every storm that brews
Comes a moment filled with hues
The sun will rise and skies will clear
With new beginnings, fresh and near

So let the storm rage as it may
For we'll brave through, come what may
And with every lightning's flash and roar
We'll weather on, forevermore.",1
"Snowflakes falling gently from the sky,
Drifting down, swirling by and by.
A peaceful hush settles on the earth,
As winter's beauty displays its worth.

Each flake unique, a tiny work of art,
As branches bow beneath snow's weighty part.
The world is coated in a pristine white,
A blanket of snow brings a wondrous sight.

Children laugh and play, bundled up tight,
Their joy infectious, hearts alight.
Snowmen emerging, built with care,
Truly a scene, enchantingly rare.

Frosty breaths, crystalized in air,
Footprints left behind without a care.
A winter wonderland transforms the land,
Beauty found in places so grand.

As snow continues to gently fall,
A calmness comes, enveloping all.
An unearthly peace, serene and still,
As winter's snow blankets every hill.

Slowly, snowflakes, dance their way,
Effortlessly settling, ready to stay.
Magical white, a sight to behold,
As snow's arrival, brings happiness untold.",1
"There  is a  sorceress in our night.  A  sky  that  only  moves  memory to make
place  for  the  mangoes of last month.  There is an old man who says,  Libéremoi.  And  means,  Take  everything   but  my  blackness.  Only  in the dark do
doves  find   reason.  Only  in  the  dark  do  doves  have  reason to believe that
vengeance  is  light  hanging  on  fallen  tree.  After each  fall, we  ask, where is
the   island,   the  sugarcane  that  disappeared  in  our hunger,  the  water that
emptied  our  thirst,  the  song   that  robbed  our  nightmare?   They  mock  us.
They  tell  us to  whisper in their ears.  They will obey.  But  curses  beat  the air
wild.  The air is faint.  And they tell us, Stop plotting fire. You are in the wrongland even if the roosters recognize you. They hated our black. What they didn't
understand is that it illuminates their world.",0
"Beauty, oh beauty, you are fleeting and rare,
A sight to behold, a bliss beyond compare.
The gentle curves of a rose, the sun setting at dawn,
The fluttering butterfly wings, the white of a swan.

The way the wind dances through the leaves,
Or the pattern of the snowflake, as it grieves,
For it knows its beauty, yet it melts away,
Just like the sun, come the end of day.

Oh, but beauty, you are not just skin deep,
It's the spark in the eyes, the smile that's so sweet,
The kindness in the heart, the laughter that's true,
These traits that make beauty, not just what we view.

Beauty is in the spirit, the soul within,
In the way one talks, acts, and where they have been.
True beauty radiates from the inside out,
And for that, my dear, there's no amount of doubt.

So cherish the beauty that surrounds us each day,
Take a step back, and in awe, we can say,
That in every corner, in big things and small,
Beauty abounds, and it touches us all.",1
"Oh, the city I wish to call home  
Is a place where the streets seem to roam  
Where the sounds of the city are sweet  
And the skyline you can’t help but greet  

The buildings, new and old, stand tall  
As if they have a story for all  
Every corner brings something new  
A place to explore all day through  

The people, a diverse culture they bring  
With different languages they can sing  
Through the hustle and bustle of life  
Their kindness does not know strife  

A city where nature is not far to seek  
In parks and gardens one can take a peek  
The river that flows by the town  
Is a serene escape from the city’s crown  

Tranquil cafes and cozy booths to rest  
Are the cherry on top of the city’s best  
It’s a place that’s hard to not adore  
A place I wish to live forevermore  

So here’s to the city I wish to inhabit  
And to all the adventures in it  
A place that feels like a dream  
A city that’s far beyond supreme.",1
"History, the elusive mystery
An ever-changing tapestry
Of stories, of myths, of facts
Of triumphs, losses, and acts

Through the ages, it has been told
From the cave paintings to the scrolls
A record of humanity’s bold
Its rise and falls, its highs and lows

The battles fought and the wars won
The cultures flourished, the empires undone
The revolutions, the inventions
The discoveries, the interventions

History, a force to reckon
For it shapes us, it enlightens
It teaches us of our past
So that we may build a better future at last

In its depth lies the wisdom
Of our ancestors, their visions
Their struggles, their perseverance
Their lessons, our inheritance

Let us remember and embrace
The wonders and the mistakes
Of history, for it is a guide
To a brighter tomorrow, where we thrive.",1

By the road she hovers in heat waves,
propped up on a cinderblock wall,
revived by mixed house paints,
fending for herself like wild mint.
She is behind your shoulder,
a blind spot, your city's poverty.
A figure waits under a freeway ramp,
gesturing as if she knows you.
The fences and lots have the same dogs,
peering through the chain-links, curious.
While at the hospital, you see kids play another
game of tag outside the emergency room doors
and know how fingerprints squander their ridges
and how digital minutes dry up under a glare.

A stump is all that is left of a surveyor's point,
a ponderosa pine in the foothills that started
the city's perfect grid.
The sidewalks of Baseline
need more than a grocery bag's empty belly,
plastic, a ripped-up flame standing and calling
out to an old preacher like yourself.
By the cameras
mounted on the street lights, you wonder
if they recorded the street sinking in the eyes
of the woman who died on a bus bench.
You pause in front of a freshly painted sign
that says ""Wrong Way,"" and see a sign within
a sign, a resistance to the newest strip mall,
the black lettering unevenly spaced and painted,
a homespun warning to keep moving on.",0
"Oh, little bug that I despise,
With prickly legs and beady eyes,
You crawl around and make me twitch,
A tiny menace that’s hard to ditch.

Your buzzing, flitting, darting flight,
Is enough to give me quite a fright,
And when you land upon my skin,
I can’t help but let out a whimpering grin.

Your tiny wings and creepy crawl,
Are enough to make me shiver and all,
And when you scuttle up my wall,
I want to grab and end your squall.

Oh pestilent insect, you crawl and bite,
Taking every opportunity to incite,
I wish you would be gone for life,
Leaving me to my peace and fries.

But alas, you’ll always crawl and scurry,
A minuscule pest that’s far too blurry,
So I’ll just have to learn to cope,
And find ways to detest you, while I hope.",1
"Locked tight and hidden deep,
A secret I've never shared or spoken.
It's a weight that I forever keep
And a secret that's never awoken.

It weighs on me like a heavy stone
And fills my thoughts with endless plight.
I'm not sure if it's better left alone,
Or if I should bring it to the light.

It's a secret that I can't let go,
One that haunts me day and night.
But the truth is, I never wanted to show
This secret that's hiding in plain sight.

Perhaps one day I'll find the strength
To release it to the open air,
But until then, it stays at length
And silently weighs down my despair.

So if you see me lost in thought,
Lost in a reverie beyond compare,
Know that a secret has been caught
And a burden I still must bear.",1
"Adventures call to those who seek
To tread unknown paths, strong and meek
With hearts bold and curious minds
As we leave our comfort behind

Through valleys deep and mountains high
We find within ourselves, a spirit to fly
The wind in our hair, the sun on our skin
We let go of fears and the what has been

Each step taken, a new story to unfold
As we embrace the unknown and let adventure take hold
The wilderness speaks with its beauty and awe
A symphony of wonder that leaves us in awe

Rivers to ford, forests to explore
As we keep moving, our journeys implore
There's no telling where the path may lead
But we keep moving forward, fulfilling the need

To see the world, to feel alive
In search of freedom, we fiercely strive
For in the end, it's not the destination that's grand
But the journey we take, and the adventures at hand.",1

He welcomed me ill;I passed by the tree and strove up the hill.This is the saying of one wise as he?A river, a rock, a star and a tree?This is the place, the shrine of the sage,Who lived his last days with beauty for wage.Here’s where the tree was long ago humbled,And a space points us out where granite has crumbled.The river is empty, and a wind sweeps the stones;The stars are not whiter than freebooter’s bones.",0

Had painted manhood on my cheek, was I,—
For yet I lived like one not born to die;
A thriftless prodigal of smiles and tears,
No hope I needed, and I knew no fears.
But sleep, though sweet, is only sleep, and waking,
I waked to sleep no more, at once o’ertaking
The vanguard of my age, with all arrears
Of duty on my back. Nor child, nor man,
Nor youth, nor sage, I find my head is grey,
For I have lost the race I never ran:
A rathe December blights my lagging May;
And still I am a child, tho’ I be old,
Time is my debtor for my years untold.",0

With fields of wheat and grazing cows,
And crystal streams that gently flows.

The rustling leaves and chirping birds,
Are nature's music, so pure and heard.

The sun sets on the horizon line,
Painting the sky with shades divine.
The moon and stars light up the night,
A dazzling spectacle that's quite a sight.

The people here are friendly and kind,
Helpful neighbors, one of a kind.
They love their country, with all their heart,
And in its service, they play their part.

"A Lesson I Avoid

There’s a lesson I avoid each day
Its importance, I dare not downplay
For facing it, I’d be forced to see
The things about myself I’d rather not be

It’s a lesson that’s hard to confront
A task that I’d rather not come to the front
For it requires introspection and reflection
An honest look at my flaws and imperfection

It’s a lesson I avoid, but I know I must learn
For in this lesson, there are things I need to discern
I must face my fears and stand up tall
I cannot keep running and hiding at all

So, I take a deep breath and face my fright
Trust the process and the journey that’s right
For the lessons I avoid are the ones I’ll need
In order to grow, to learn, to succeed.",1

That wanders through the cosmic room,
Its dark power brings despair,
And misery fills the air.

It floats at will, with no regard,
For life or joy, it acts as guard,
Of sadness and grief, it's the king,
And in its wake, hope cannot cling.

I loathe the way it shrouds the light,
That guides me through the darkest night,
And plunges me into an abyss,
Where nothing blooms, no joy, no bliss.

I curse its cold and lifeless heart,
That rips apart all that's a work of art,
Destruction, chaos, its only friends,
Bringing nothing but cruel ends.

Oh, asteroid of gloom, I hope you'll pass,
And leave my world, regain some class,
For I wish to live in a place,
Where love and light still have their space.",1

And every note, a prayer entwine 

Each lyric a tale of love 
Unfolding like blossoming flowers 
A soaring chorus high above 
A harmony that forever towers 

Rhythm resonating in the chest 
Composing a song of its own 
A composition that does its best 
To connect us to the unknown 

From the depths of the soul 
This melody takes its rightful place 
A reminder of what makes us whole 
As it sings of beauty and grace 

Enchanted melodies of the heart 
Our never-ending serenade 
May it never be torn apart 
And forever in us played.",1
"A mistake so fascinating
That it draws my mind's attention
It's a blunder that amazes me
In ways that cannot be mentioned

How could someone fall so hard?
Yet still have so much to give
A step that was misplaced
But led to a life-changing shift

The mistake that broke a heart
Yet created a new beginning
The one that caused so much pain
But led to a soulful living

It reminds me of the beauty
That can be found in defeat
A wrong turn taken in stride
That leads to amazing feats

This mistake that's fascinating
Is one that I'll always treasure
For it reminds me that errors
Can lead to a new measure

So when I make my own mistakes
I'll look back on this one with glee
For it's a reminder that even
The best of us can misstep occasionally.",1

It's like a storm within my chest
A tempest that won't rest
A wildness that can't be tamed
A flame that can't be blamed

A weight that I can't bear 
An emotion that I cannot share 

It's like being lost at sea 
A vast expanse of mystery 
An endless tide that ebbs and flows 
A journey that no one knows 

It's a melody that I can hear 
A haunting song that draws me near 
A symphony that I can feel 
A rhythm that is all too real 

It's a moment that I can't forget 
A memory that is always set 
A feeling that will never die 
A love that will never lie 

So I embrace this tempestuous ride 
With open arms and nothing to hide 
For feeling is what makes us truly alive 
A journey worth taking, a battle worth the strife.",1

To feel the wind rushing by me as I run
And the thrill of kicking that ball with vigor
Until the net bulges and the cheers have begun

Where each member is vital to success
Where we work together and never lose focus
On that one goal, to win and to impress

The grass beneath my feet, the smell of the field
The energy of the crowd, the roar of the cheers
All of this, and more, is what soccer yields
It's a sport that can make you forget all your fears

So let me lace up my cleats and take the pitch
To feel the glory of a well-placed pass
To hear the sound of the ball hitting the switch
As it flies into the goal, oh what a gas!

Yes, soccer is the sport that I want to play
To feel the rush, to be part of the fray
To be challenged, to push myself to the limit
All of this I crave, and I am so eager to exhibit.",1
"Its small celestial reach stops
where the counterweight, the first
tough green fruit, pulls earthward
and returns the brazen, almost rank perfume
of blossoms now six months gone.
The slurred odor of its leaves
calls back that long evening’s end:
we shivered in the cool light
a northerly sun bent against the world
into the hands of friends
who helped clear the outdoor supper’s
sharp debris—forks, tin plates,
balled napkins and bone nests.
The lemon blossoms throbbed. The air
slowed with so much young life,
the fragrance quickened in our veins
the common, too surprising wish
to hold, just then, another,
whoever stood nearest, whatever charm
would bind us to the lowering light.
Then someone said, “Let’s eat the tree”—
Tear apart the bole, raid the green heart,
devour remembrance with one moment’s
hunger and eat the nature of things.
Scraped plates, laughter, glasses refilled . . .
Our sweet anger urged and gathered us
around the young tree’s tub, made us
tamp the wet soil and drink fast
the clear smell of unseen yellow fruit
in time we ourselves might never know.",0
"In Chicago, it is snowing softly
and a man has just done his wash for the week.
He steps into the twilight of early evening,
carrying a wrinkled shopping bag
full of neatly folded clothes,
and, for a moment, enjoys
the feel of warm laundry and crinkled paper,
flannellike against his gloveless hands.
There’s a Rembrandt glow on his face,
a triangle of orange in the hollow of his cheek
as a last flash of sunset
blazes the storefronts and lit windows of the street.
He is Asian, Thai or Vietnamese,
and very skinny, dressed as one of the poor
in rumpled suit pants and a plaid mackinaw,
dingy and too large.
He negotiates the slick of ice
on the sidewalk by his car,
opens the Fairlane’s back door,
leans to place the laundry in,
and turns, for an instant,
toward the flurry of footsteps
and cries of pedestrians
as a boy—that’s all he was—
backs from the corner package store
shooting a pistol, firing it,
once, at the dumbfounded man
who falls forward,
grabbing at his chest.
A few sounds escape from his mouth,
a babbling no one understands
as people surround him
bewildered at his speech.
The noises he makes are nothing to them.
The boy has gone, lost
in the light array of foot traffic
dappling the snow with fresh prints.
Tonight, I read about Descartes’
grand courage to doubt everything
except his own miraculous existence
and I feel so distinct
from the wounded man lying on the concrete
I am ashamed.
Let the night sky cover him as he dies.
Let the weaver girl cross the bridge of heaven
and take up his cold hands.

"Tears, oh tears, precious drops of pain,
Expressing emotions too difficult to contain,
They fall down our face, like a gentle rain,
A release for our heart, a comfort for our brain.

They come in moments of sorrow and grief,
In moments of joy, pure and brief,
They roll down our cheeks, with utmost belief,
An outlet for the soul, an escape for the thief.

Sometimes we cry, without a reason or why,
Sometimes we let go, without even trying to pry,
Tears, oh tears, they make us feel alive,
Invisible yet visible, they help us thrive.

They speak of our struggles, of our defeat,
Of the battles fought, of the wars we meet,
They tell tales of love, of longing and regret,
Of things we hope for, but can never truly get.

Tears, oh tears, they hold the truth,
Of our deepest desires, of our lost youth,
They bring healing, they bring the proof,
That life is not perfect, but still, it's worth the pursuit.

So let them fall, let them flow,
Let them cleanse your heart, and help you grow,
For tears, oh tears, they are the signs,
Of a life well-lived, of a soul that shines.",1
"A shooting star streaks across the sky,
A fleeting moment of magic and wonder,
A glimmering gem that catches the eye,
A celestial dance, a heavenly ponder.

In the darkness of the endless night,
It twinkles with an otherworldly grace,
A fleeting glimpse of pure delight,
A luminescence that leaves no trace.

But in that moment, time stands still,
As we close our eyes and make a wish,
The universe grants us its will,
In a burst of light, a fiery kiss.

As the shooting star fades away,
Its memory burns bright in our heart,
And we know that come what may,
We're all a part of this cosmic art.",1

behind our block, six frame houses
holding six immigrant families,
the parents speaking only gibberish
to their neighbors. Without the kids
they couldn't say ""Good morning"" and be
understood. Little wonder
he learned early to speak to himself,
to tell no one what truly mattered.
How much can matter to a kid
of seven? Everything. The whole world
can be his. Just after dawn he sneaks
out to hide in the wild, bleached grasses
of August and pretends he's grown up,
someone complete in himself without
the need for anyone, a warrior
from the ancient places our fathers
fled years before, those magic places:
Kiev, Odessa, the Crimea,
Port Said, Alexandria, Lisbon,
the Canaries, Caracas, Galveston.
In the damp grass he recites the names
over and over in a hushed voice
while the sun climbs into the locust tree
to waken the houses. The husbands leave
for work, the women return to bed, the kids
bend to porridge and milk. He advances
slowly, eyes fixed, an animal or a god,

A melody that makes us whole
A symphony of notes and sounds
That lift us up and bring us down

We find our passion, we find our core
In the tunes that move and inspire
We feel alive, we feel desire

From Bach to Beethoven, Mozart to Queen
The power of music can't be unseen
It touches hearts and opens minds
And leaves us breathless, lost in time

The music plays, the dancers sway
The lyrics move us in every way
It's the language of the heart and soul
A timeless treasure that makes us whole

And let it take you anywhere
For in its rhythm, we can find
A world where love and harmony bind.",1

As you dance upon each lake.

With every drop, a promise new,
Of life and growth, pure and true,
Reviving all that is dead and dry,
As the land begins to thrive.

Your beauty, a sight to behold,
Majestic, wondrous, and bold,
A gift from heaven, so pure,
A magic that will forever endure.

Rain, your artistry sublime,
Filling the air with a fragrance divine,
A mystical force that feeds our soul,
Forever a source of hope and joy untold.",1
"The fragrant scent that fills the air
A smell so sweet, beyond compare
It dances in your nose so fine
And leaves you lost in blissful time

The smell of roses, fresh and bright
Or lavender on a summer's night
The scent of freshly brewed coffee
Softens one's heart and makes us happy

The salty breeze down by the shore
A smell of summer, we adore
Or the beauty of a campfire's smoke
Reminds us of evenings with love and hope

The aroma of baking bread
Takes our souls on a tasty thread
Or even sweet perfume that lingers
Reminding us of loves and fond memories

So close your eyes now, take a breath
And let yourself be swept from death
For with each breath we take in life
Of memories, moments, love that's alive.",1

"I went to my mother’s room at 13
past midnight, and told her I was dying.
I’d wet the bed, I’d had this crazy dream,
about a sexy neighbor I’d been spying
on. Well, I didn’t tell her that. I mean,
the day before she asked who I was eyeing
when I didn’t want to go outside
for ice cream. The truck was parked out front,
and she was buying, but I couldn’t join
the other screaming kids —
not with Lance applying suntan lotion
to his muscled teenage skin.
Stretched out on a beach towel
in his front yard, his body mystified me,
while mine seemed happy to defy me.
My dick would tent my cut-offs
at the sight of him.
I wore two pair of underwear,
but even then I thought I’d burst
right through the seams.
So I didn’t dare tell mother what I’d dreamed,
though she did think to ask me.
I’d have been a fool to tell her that.
She thought my blush was any boy’s,
puzzling out his sexuality, but I swear it was
as much because the fantasies
were always other boys.
some from my baseball team,
some the roughnecks at school,
but usually Lance. He was flying
naked in the dream I had that night,
the one that made me think that God
was mad and killing me. I was lying
(also naked — and hard as cinder block)
on the beach towel I’d seen him lay
across the grass the day before.
I tried to understand the signs implying
I might turn into some kind of freaky thing.
But it would have been cruel to tell my mother that,
especially when she was already crying,
and trying not to laugh at the same time,
when I showed her what came out of me.
She apologized for throwing such a scene,
said I was growing up to be a man, that’s all it meant,
said it was normal for a boy my age’s thing
to start uprising like a metal beam.
She apologized again
that I didn’t have my dad around to train
an 11-year old boy in the ways of puberty.
I was as stupefied as I’ve ever been.
She never mentioned him.
And I have never turned a deeper red
than I did then, at 26 past midnight,
when my mother helped me change my sheets,
and said the next day she’d teach me to wash them.
And then she said she’d ask the man across the street
to talk to me. Would that be okay?
Or would I feel more comfortable
with someone younger, like his son?",0
"A melody so pure and true,
I listened and I knew
That every note was meant for me,
To stir my soul and set it free.

The rhythm flowed like a river,
A journey to my heart forever.
Each verse a story in its own,
And every lyric seemed to hone,
The essence of all that I feel,
A song that heals and helps me heal.

The singer's voice so sweet and clear,
A whisper in my ear,
That the world is not so gray,
And hope will come to light the way.

The music soared and touched my soul,
And I knew I was not alone.
For every person on this earth,
Has felt the joy and pain of birth.

And in the end, the song will fade,
But its message will not evade,
For every time I hear it play,
It will uplift me day by day.",1

"Wisdom can be found in many things,
In the air we breathe, in the songs we sing,
In the depths of the ocean, in the heights of the sky,
In the silence of the forest, in the loudness of a cry.

Wisdom is not something one can acquire,
It is not something to buy, to own or to admire,
It is a gentle voice that speaks from within,
It is a light that guides us through thick and thin.

Wisdom is the gift of the ages,
Of the sages and the philosophers and the wise,
It is the art of living the human life,
With compassion, love, and eternal ties.

Wisdom is the grace that comes with time,
The fruit of experience, the wine of the divine,
It is the power to see beyond what's seen,
To find beauty in the ugly, and meaning in the mean.

So, seek for wisdom with an open heart,
And listen to the whispers of your inner part,
For in its depth, you'll find the key,
To unlock the doors of eternity.",1
"1. deathbed
There is a word that is not water,
has nothing to do with heat or light,
is unrelated to any one pain
though the torn body tears itself further
trying to speak it.
There is a sound
beyond all the sounds that I have made,
the needs that one by one I've tried to name.
It burns clear in the eyes searching mine,
the lips beginning to bleed again,
her hand squeezing my hand,
pleading and pleading that I understand.
2. living will
All afternoon in the afterlife
of little things that love,
or pain, or need could not let go of
I hunt for the will
that will let me let you go.
I am distracted and slow—
all the grainy faces
in old photographs, letters
from the dead, deeds to places
that are only air,
some bright nowhere
of broad fields and sunlight
that was my idea of heaven
one long afternoon
of clouds and steady rain
when you sat and explained
where a garden was, a well,
excited by it, the hell
ahead of you
just a brief tightness at your heart.
Outside in the yard, crickets start,
cry here and here and here,
night's thousand shadows growing tall.
And now I have it, formal, final.
I touch each keepsake like a wall.
3. going
In the hard light and hum
of the room to which I've come
to stay, I watch the clock,
and wait, and hour by hour
begin to disappear.
Movements, mutterings: the brain
darkens like a landscape. Pain
in the pale arterial hills
flashes and vanishes,
takes with it one whole year.
Cotton and killdeer, a cloud
looks down, something's happened
in the wellhouse, someone runs
through tall trees, breathe and breathe,
is it my hand you hold?
The fever climbs. You grow cold,
then warm, now cold again,
a hive of nerves in the skin.
Some glimmer breaks through
and I bend whispering as fear
like a wind shakes you,I'm right here, I'm right here...
Midnight, moonlight gauzing
the walls, the iron and umber
of intensive care:
I watch as it swells and falls
the puttied scar at your heart,
and read each beat and falter
on a screen and match my breathing
to the breathing of a machine
to know this time as it passes,
each moment as it goes—
until, early, you shudder
and quieten, blood gases
begin to rapidly rise
and somewhere behind your eyes
I fall in fragments away:
a child surprised at his play,
encroached upon by air,
a shattered man near dawn,
something about the way
he holds so still, his hair.",0
"A serene lake, not too far away
Where you can sit and quietly gaze
Reflections dancing on the blue
A peaceful view, so calm and true

The gentle breeze whispers through the trees
A soothing sound that puts you at ease
The sun sets slow, the horizon glows
A natural beauty that just overflows

The ripples on the water's calm facade
Create the most beautiful abstract art 
Majestic geese swimming free
In the lustrous waters of the beautiful sea

The fragrance of wildflowers fills the air
A sweet aroma that's everywhere
As day turns to night, the sky turns gold
A stunning view that's etched and sold

The lake, a place of tranquil bliss
A true escape from the daily abyss
Come sit and have a pleasant time
A moment cherished and sublime.",1

An ape feels natural in the word trapeze.",0
"Raindrops pattering on the roofs,
A symphony of soothing sounds.
A constant rhythm that behooves,
Our minds to calm and hearts unbound.

A lullaby that puts us to rest,
As we listen to each connecting drop.
A voicing that is never stressed,
But with a melody that'll never stop.

Steady like the beating heart,
Soft like whispers in the night.
It captures every living part,
And sets our soul alight.

Rain, oh rain, how you enchant,
With your symphony of splatters.
Your sound I'll always recant,
For it's music that always matters.",1

From here groomed fields and clumps of trees,
a silo of corrugated tin and a white barn blur.

In Armenian there’s a word—garod—rhymes with “maud.”
The beautiful ones are not faithful

a student said that about some Pavese translations,
here in my office.
Should I tell you what garod means?

What’s happening in Spitak and Sarajevo and the West Bank
is splayed like the cortex of a silicon chip in the fuzzy air.
Maria, the physician from Armenia, was 25 & had one plastic arm
and one real arm. I met her in East Hampton on the deck of a house on the dunes.
After the earthquake she had no husband,
no parents, and only one child.
“I’m in a good mood today,” she said, “let’s talk about
something else.” I poured her an Amstel Light.

The coolness intrudes—
month of wind-sprints and retching for the coach.
It comes back like nerve ends after surgery.
Along a country road cicadas rattling.
Chicory and sweet pea intruding on the ripe barley.
I picked up some seed packs from a junk shop on Rt. 20,
a tomato blazed in red ink/ 1926, Fredonia, N.Y.
8/11
What’s between us? The red ink of the tomato?
How does an image stay? Or is it always aftermath?
The way deep black reflected the most light in Talbot’s first calotypes.
But garod: tongue of a snake,
meaning exile, longing for home.
Thomas Wedgwood got images by getting sunlight
to pass through things onto paper brushed with silver nitrate:
wings of a dragonfly, the spine of an oak leaf—
fugitive photograms. But he couldn’t stop the sun
until it turned the paper black.
Stop the light before it goes too far?
Or is desire what garod means?
Longing for a native place.

Maria said she was learning how to connect nerve endings
in the hand so hands and arms would work again.
There were so many in Armenia without working hands and arms.
At the end of each dendrite is a blurred line
like the horizon I’m squinting.
Image of the other:
light-arrested; not the image of ourselves.

After digging scallions one day Dickinson defined freedom:   Captivity’s consciousness, so’s liberty.

The artlessness of silver is like my tongue in your wet space,

Beloved topography,garod then must mean yearning.
Is that how we loved under the rattling Nippon porcelain,
in the light calotyped by the fire escape?

garod: the grain chute that spills
into a dark barn which is endless,
like the self when it’s out of reach.
Are we so lonely that a constellation

and that be me or you?
But still we’re piss and oats and stock in there.
We’re like civet, who wouldn’t love it.

the driveway away from the bricks. Wrens come,
crusts from our dishes make drama. Then history.
What is possible in memory is disingenuous.

Oh sweet deceit, how softly you sing,
A lullaby of falsehood that fools bring.
You whisper sweet nothings, a lover's embrace,
Yet your words are empty, you leave no trace.

You spin a web of falsehoods galore,
Leaving chaos and destruction at your door.
With every fib and every ploy,
You slowly strip us of our joy.

A place where truth cannot compete.
You mask the truth with a twisted smile,
And leave us trapped in a world of denial.

But in the end, the truth will prevail,
And your deceitful song will ultimately fail.
For honesty is the only way,
To live a life that's pure and gay.

So sleep well, oh cunning liar,
For the truth shall never tire.
And one day, you'll have to pay,
For the lies you spun along the way.",1

Perhaps his mother whimpered how she’d fret Until he got a nice safe wound to nurse. Sisters would wish girls too could shoot, charge, curse … Brothers—would send his favourite cigarette. Each week, month after month, they wrote the same, Thinking him sheltered in some Y.M. Hut, Because he said so, writing on his butt Where once an hour a bullet missed its aim And misses teased the hunger of his brain. His eyes grew old with wincing, and his hand Reckless with ague. Courage leaked, as sand From the best sand-bags after years of rain. But never leave, wound, fever, trench-foot, shock, Untrapped the wretch. And death seemed still withheld For torture of lying machinally shelled, At the pleasure of this world’s Powers who’d run amok.   He’d seen men shoot their hands, on night patrol. Their people never knew. Yet they were vile. ‘Death sooner than dishonour, that’s the style!’ So Father said.                                        II. THE ACTION                                 One dawn, our wire patrol Carried him. This time, Death had not missed. We could do nothing but wipe his bleeding cough. Could it be accident? - Rifles go off… Not sniped? No. (Later they found the English ball.)                                        III. THE POEM   It was the reasoned crisis of his soul Against more days of inescapable thrall, Against infrangibly wired and blind trench wall Curtained with fire, roofed in with creeping fire, Slow grazing fire, that would not burn him whole But kept him for death’s promises and scoff, And life’s half-promising, and both their riling.

"A Load of brushes and baskets and cradles and chairs
Labours along the street in the rain:
With it a man, a woman, a pony with whiteybrown hairs. —
The man foots in front of the horse with a shambling sway
At a slower tread than a funeral train,
While to a dirge-like tune he chants his wares,
Swinging a Turk's-head brush (in a drum-major's way
When the bandsmen march and play).
A yard from the back of the man is the whiteybrown pony's nose:
He mirrors his master in every item of pace and pose:
He stops when the man stops, without being told,
And seems to be eased by a pause; too plainly he's old,
Indeed, not strength enough shows
To steer the disjointed waggon straight,
Which wriggles left and right in a rambling line,
Deflected thus by its own warp and weight,
And pushing the pony with it in each incline.
The woman walks on the pavement verge,
Parallel to the man:
She wears an apron white and wide in span,
And carries a like Turk's-head, but more in nursing-wise:
Now and then she joins in his dirge,
But as if her thoughts were on distant things,
The rain clams her apron till it clings. —

Morning matured, she brought me a glass of water.

We had silver moving clowns, the most famous of which resembled our worst villain, which confused us. Little toothbrush mustaches.
We had an abundance, for once, of chocolate and tobacco, and nearly everyone drank a sweet bubbly beverage flavored by a South American plant. It somewhat burned our nose and throat.
My mood was sweet and even, the rain was warm driving down the road with the radio on. It played some lovely exciting tune. Then, an unctuous voice with news of war.
You drove to work with your coffee between your legs, the line ahead pink near the tree line, your dashboard with serene green lights. In the back seat was a Wild Bill Hickock coloring book and a small sneaker. It read Red Ball Jets.
You stumbled into the cold green sea, enervated, with a dry mouth, afraid you might step in a hole and drown. You can’t swim. The beach is ahead, some palm fronds wave. It’s beautiful, like Bali Hai, but there are planes descending ack ack ack, making filmic little fountains of sand where they strafe the beach. Finally, reaching the woods, and separated from your company, you all asleep.
Some of your son’s crayons melted in the back window. Remember to scrape those up, or melt it with wax paper and an iron, as the newspaper instructed.   Bring home the Butternut Bread, Fred.
We each had Rangoon Night Market Noodles. They were salty, with pieces of duck. Then we went to a movie. Someone sat on my homburg. When it was over, we walked out stunned and embarrassed. Even mediocre films communicate with one’s childhood. The line of people waiting to get in examined us carefully. And for an hour after this, every little sound was delicious: the keys in our pocket, the creak of our seats, the bedsprings when we crawled into bed, effects in a soundtrack. Our sex was a little melodramatic, with a loopy grandeur. And afterwards we were so thirsty.
We watched the solar eclipse in Dad’s welding helmet, his crusader’s helm, wobbling and blind.
Our tongue always smarted with the astringent mint of the toothpaste when we moved to the bed, and she was always burning holes in her nylons with those goddamn Pell Mells.
Sunday night you were alone in the farmhouse, near sunset. It had been a hot day, with cicadas humming in the corn, the sound rising into the hot blue silver. You took a bath, and when you walked into the living room, still a little wet, the curtains planed horizontal, and you could hear distant thunder. The radio was low, playing classical music. The corn leaves were active, but discreet. That night you sat on the front porch steps drinking your son’s Hi-C citrus cooler. A special events floodlight examined the horizon.
Under a sky thick and like pewter, lying there reading with the window open, you heard a Brooklyn catbird imitate a car alarm, the series of warbles and chirps identical, and in the same sequence. The famous Car Alarm Bird.
You like the way the brushes sound over the car radio when the drummer plays with a small ensemble. As the station gets further away, the sound of the brushes mixes with static, as though some small bright particles were bunched there at the end of his hands. You worry about the car when you leave the tarmac because the bottom pings with small stones from the hardpan. The red radio towers blink far ahead, and off to the right. Soon you move up under them.",0
"In the darkest of nights,
The moon shines bright,
A contrast so stark,
It highlights the plight.

The black and the white,
The high and the low,
The fire and the ice,
The fast and the slow.

Life's full of contrast,
It's what makes us unique,
A blend of the opposites,
Creating the mystique.

The happy and the sad,
The right and the wrong,
The weak and the strong,
The short and the long.

Embrace the contrast,
See the beauty it brings,
For without the darkness,
We cannot cherish the spring.

In the bleakness and light,
Contrast is the key,
For in living the contrast,
We find harmony.",1
"Winter, oh winter, with your icy breath
You blanket the earth with a chill of death
You cover the trees in a coat of white
Your winds blow cold with all your might

The snowflakes fall gently from the sky
As peaceful as a baby's lullaby
The world is hushed under your spell
And only the winter birds can tell

Your frigid grip holds everything tight
As the long nights deepen into night
The warmth of summer is long gone
And you reign supreme till the dawn

Winter, oh winter, you are not cruel
Just a time of rest for nature's jewels
Soon the sun will rise with its warming rays
And you will retreat till the next winter day.",1
"Penelope for her Ulisses sake,
Deviz’d a Web her wooers to deceave:
In which the worke that she all day did make
The same at night she did again unreave:
Such subtile craft my Damzell doth conceave,
Th’ importune suit of my desire to shonne:
For all that I in many dayes doo weave,
In one short houre I find by her undonne.
So when I thinke to end that I begonne,
I must begin and never bring to end:
For with one looke she spils that long I sponne,
And with one word my whole years work doth rend.
Such labour like the Spyders web I fynd,
Whose fruitless worke is broken with least wynd.",0
"All summer connotations fill this light,
a symmetry of different scales—the site
of fibrous silence, the velvet lace
of iris, alders the moon can ignite.
One feels the amplitude of grief, the pace
of oscillating stars, power in place
where time has crossed and left a breathy stain.
A body needs the weight and thrust of grace.
I want to parse the logic, spin and domain,
the structure mourning will allow, the grain
of certainty in two estates, the dance
of perfect order, flowing toward its plane.
That bird you see has caught a proper stance,
unfaithful to its measure, a pert mischance
of divination on the move, the trace
of sacred darkness true to light's advance.",0
"The autumn leaves fall
As the winter frost creeps in
Nature's serenade of the seasons

The chill of the air
Signals the arrival of snow
A melody of winter's song

Spring blossoms bring life
Soft petals floating on breeze
A dance of nature's rhythm

Summer's heat blazes
Golden sunflowers sway tall
A symphony of vibrant hues

Nature's serenade
A never-ending cycle
Of the seasons' harmonies.",1
"I made up a story for myself once,   That each glove I lost   Was sent to my father in prison   That’s all it would take for him   To chart my growth without pictures   Without words or visits,   Only colors and design,   Texture; it was ok then   For skin to chafe and ash,   To imagine him   Trying on a glove,   Stretching it out   My open palm closing   And disappearing   In his fist.",0
"Taste, a thing of wonder
An experience to behold
A sensation of the senses
A story to be told

It's a journey through flavors
A dance upon the tongue
A mystical exploration
Of the delights among

A symphony of sensations
A palette of pure delight
A feast for the discerning
A joy for every sight

It's a taste of memories
Of childhood and of home
Of moments so divine
In flavors yet unknown

So savor every morsel
For taste is life's sweetest treat
A reminder of our humanity
A moment we all should meet.",1
"Up in the sky, it gleams so bright  
The silver orb that shines at night  
Its light casts shadows on the ground  
And peace and magic all around  

The moon, a symbol of the night  
A source of inspiration and light  
A celestial beauty in the sky  
A guide for wanderers, don't ask why  

It waxes and it wanes it seems,  
A glimmer in those darkest dreams.   
Yet even in its slender state,  
It holds enough to captivate.   

The phases follow one by one  
As nights go by, it's never done  
A changing face, a different phase  
It wields its magic in myriad ways  

With its beams and its mystic hue  
The moon makes everything feel new  
For in the moment it appears  
All of our worries disappear   

So let us bask in the moon's glow  
And let it guide us, ever so  
For in its light, we'll always find  
Peace, and solace, and solace in its divine.",1
"Rain, midnight rain, nothing but the wild rain On this bleak hut, and solitude, and me Remembering again that I shall die And neither hear the rain nor give it thanks For washing me cleaner than I have been Since I was born into solitude. Blessed are the dead that the rain rains upon: But here I pray that none whom once I loved Is dying tonight or lying still awake Solitary, listening to the rain, Either in pain or thus in sympathy Helpless among the living and the dead, Like a cold water among broken reeds, Myriads of broken reeds all still and stiff, Like me who have no love which this wild rain Has not dissolved except the love of death, If love it be towards what is perfect and Cannot, the tempest tells me, disappoint.",0
"Day is carved in marble, a man reclining,
a naked giant suffering.
Preoccupied Day faces Night, who is a woman,
huge, naked, Herculean, both pillowed
on their uncarved rough marble bed.
They need light to be seen, neither
has anything to do with the sun or moon.
Art is not astronomy,
but the heavens are useful as gardening to poets,
not useful as love or loneliness.
If I write out of arrogance and ignorance
a poem called Day, my chisel and mallet, words
and pen, paper my marble, I must not confuse
sunlight and Day, petals with hours. I could rhyme,
perhaps by reason and chance describe the nature of Day.
I might discover Nature is surprisingly
sometimes moral, unexpected, a principle
over which the lovers Night and Day quarrel.
In my poem, faithful Night and faithful Day quarreled;
rhyme told me they quarreled because Day is gold,
Night hates the thought of celestial money,
rages at the starless differences between cost and price.
Michelangelo did not choose to make a sculpturePrezzo, or put the finger of God on a coin.
Day and Night saw Danaë’s legs spread apart
for Zeus to enter as a shower of gold.
They are not household gods or saints.
Better I write about things nearby,
a chair, a stool, the principle I’m sitting on.
Day is my dictionary. If my Day were animal, he might be
a baby elephant who eats leaves.
My good Day stays close to his mother,
who is murdered for her ivory tusks.
My Day is an endangered specie. I whisper
into elephant ears, peace, my darling little Day.
An owl hoots, your Day has no given name!
True, I refuse names useful to many others:
Sabbath, Sunday, Friday, Saturday.
My Day is not baptized, circumcised, or blessed.
I pick him up and hold Day in my arms.
I put my head in Day’s open mouth.
I tongue Day, and Day tongues me.
Yes, although my Day loves Night,
he tongues me in and out of bed.
My Day knows Night carnally,
lets Night know me.
So I love Day today.
And I love Night tonight.",0
"The Whispers of the Wind

The whispers of the wind, so gentle and true
Carrying secrets, old and new
They speak of lands far away
Of distant friends and joys astray

Their hush so soothing, their songs so sweet
They fill my heart with love and heat
Their touch so light, their presence so grand
They leave me feeling warm and loved, like a friend

They dance in the meadows, they rustle the leaves
They sway the trees, they calm the seas
They bring with them hope, they bring with them peace
Their whispers bring comfort, their whispers bring ease

So let the wind whisper, its secrets so grand
Let it sing its songs, across the land
For it brings with it a message, of love divine
The whispers of the wind, will forever be mine.",1
